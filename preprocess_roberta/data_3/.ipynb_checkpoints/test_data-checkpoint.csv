1,"Please, do translation in other language for the posters... (like french for exemple)"
1,This has got to be their scariest video yet.
1,so what you're saying is the way to avoid it is to have nose plugs
1,"Hence, Ivermectin, then you’re good to go"
1,A YouTube viewer saw a Kurzgesagt video in their subscription feed. Here's how they spent all of their disposable income for the month in one afternoon.
1,surprised they didn't mention the problem of the media 'overhyping' it for clickbait
0,Thanks I now hate swimming.
1,Narrator birb is amazing :'3
1,"Welp, time to never swim in a pond."
1,Imune cell: its retaliation what do you expect

0,So what ended up killing us is the very thing that is protecting us
2,"Wooow, AMAZING! PERFECT JOB! YOU ARE GREAT!"
1,Can’t wait to watch this new video
1,This infection is actually the second deadliest on the planet after rabies (100% death after symptoms).

0,New fear unlocked...

1,"Thank you, black blob of anxiety, for reminding me how awesome I am for having a kurzgesagt poster."
1,The animation is becoming anime-like!
1,"it's pretty scary, ngl, though i'm even more afraid of another brain eating parasite called internet"
1,Now I'm afraid of swimming grinning_face_with_sweat
1,Ahhhh. My daily dose of existential dread.
2,I hate and love this channel at the same time
0,This perasite is now my biggest fear
1,Wait until someone takes this bacteria and modify its DNA into a bio weapon. Things are gonna get dark real quick.
1,Is it in the book immune cuz if it is I wanna buy it now
1,"Amazing how an infection actually is total war inside of us, with millions of casualties."
1,"damn suddenly everyones brother sister fifthiest cousin three times removed all died from this extremely rare disease, and they’re in the comment section here, how unlucky!"
1,I remember months ago water from shower come into my nose and i googled about it and i though i have that ameoba until i search where it can only located and how many deaths per year
1,"I don't want to ever swim in a lake or a swimming pool anymore. Thanks, Kurzgesagt."
1,"Can we please make ""Existential Dread"" a recurring Kurzgesagt character?"
1,"Dont mind me, Just my daily dose of Kurzgesagt's existential dread which somehow seems to work every video..."
1,Anybody else rewatching this video after getting lake water up their nose?
1,"Babe, wake up, new existentially horrifying Kurzgesagt just dropped."
1,"ok, im ready, upload my mind to the computer."
1,"they gave it such a nefarious name, too"
1,EVERYONE BE QUITE. WE HAD A NARRATOR REVEAL.
1,"Me: ah, it's good being calm and happy.
Kurzgesagt: SURPRISE MOTHER FUCKER!"
1,I love how the guy was done I wonder how much time it took for this detail
1,You know this much information about them we could have developed up some kind of cure against these ameoba somebody somehow
1,"Oh cool, a nature-made horror beyond my comprehension...
Crisp animation, though!"
1,This will probably be a bigger threat to us in the future right? Since global warming is a thing.
1,amazing video and all but damn that backround music slaps
1,do not do this to me i just got home from a vacation and i accidentaly got water into my nose because of a wave
1,This fills me with existential dread... which causes me pleasure. Fear makes me learn... which feels so good.
1,New phobia unlocked: water
1,You’ve just open a new anxiety that now I have…..I need a therapist.
1,"At one point in our evolution, we absorbed a few virus genes into our DNA.
If I was paranoid enough, I'd splice this amoeba into my biocode."
1,I wonder what year will herald the debut of Kurzgesagt in 4K.
1,"This channel honestly reminds me of myself. Learning about some of the scariest and deadliest things in the world, due to curiosity and boredom, only to realize that it was a bad idea for my anxiety and now I have to calm myself down or forget about it"
1,"The worst monsters on Earth are all microscopic, this one is just another that feeds on your brain."
1,"German viewers: Hey! I've seen this one before!
English viewers: What do you mean you've seen it before? This is new!"
1,"Oh yeah, I am gonna spend 10 minutes listening a detailed explanation of how I could die"
1,Guess early
1,the existential dread character kinda reminds me of the god of void from hollow knight black_heart
1,its more light
1,AVSOAYS SUXKWBZUEMAIFW  THAT BIRB IN THE END IS SO CUTE
1,I actually like the existential dread feeling. I cant really explain it
1,"The most common way humans get infected is when they intentionally put water in their noses to ""irrigate"" out the excess mucus with a neti pot. You can have your neti pot and avoid the amoeba too by purchasing distilled water for your neti pot, and generally not ever letting said pot come into contact with tap water."
1,"If I were a teacher, i'd plaster my walls with your posters.  Keep up the great work!"
1,I did not need this in the back of my mind next time I go for a swim >_<
2,Every video is like a knowledge gift
1,"I know it's an ad, but learning so much is bringing me trouble"
1,"Thank u kurzgesagt, i'm never swimming anywhere again)"
1,"Its been sooo long that i didn't hear about thus really bring back memories.

Good video love it"
1,So happy about the statistics at the end. Because this got me scared sh*tless for any kind of water until I realize it's probably only slightly better odds for you to catch it than it is to win the lottery.
1,"I didn't have to learn about this but here I am, I am now just a little bit more terrified of the sea than I already was."
2,Well that was horrifying.
1,This video makes something that I normally wouldn't think about terrifying. Well done.
1,"Most people in the Southern United states have to deal with these and the flesh eating ones (saltwater). Typically during summer, and at least one kid has died every year from it."
1,¡¡¡¡¡Wow that human animation at the start was awesome!!!
1,And this is why you shouldn't put amiibos in your nose.
0,"My new phobia:











Water"
1,I just had to watch this during a time when I was considering getting a swimsuit to go swimming...
1," I think that's the first time I have seen a human face that detailed in a Kurzgesagt video, and it fucking freaked me out."
1,Tthey're animation has honestly gotten better.
1,An RTS game about the immune system would be fun I think!
0,"Me: swimming helps with my back pain!
*has autoimmune diseases and severe anxiety*

Living is suffering"
2,Wow... what a nemesis
1,"18 million subs, way to go!"
1,you said there atracted to heat right? aslong as i drink really cold water im fine smiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,": microbe Naegleria fowleri is a deadly amoeba that can enter the human body and cause harm.
: microbe Naegleria fowleri, a brain-eating amoeba, can bypass the immune system and target nerve cells in the nose.
: skull Naegleria fowleri, a brain-eating amoeba, attacks and kills brain cells by releasing attack molecules and multiplying rapidly.
: skull Infection by Naegleria fowleri causes a disastrous battle in the brain, leading to severe symptoms and death.
: face_screaming_in_fear Existential dread tries to make the person question their existence, but fails because the posters and educational content make them feel excited and in awe of the universe.
Recap by Tammy AI"
1,Can you guys do a video about if zombie virus is possible from natural evolution or genetic modification?
1,"Amoeba exists...

Brain: Im in danger.

Cells:Among us"
1,This explains the Democratic Party
1,"my immune system defeated 2 corona,1 bacrerial phenomina,and fever every to weeks and finally fungus"
1,I REALLY wish I have not clicked on this video and watched it…
0,"While Ukraine is being devoured with Russian forces and people are dying, and World MacroEconomics changing because of that war.
You are doing the video about bacteria that are rarely killing people and we can do nothing with it.

Shame, shame, shame..."
1,Amoebae are so fascinating. I spent ours at the microscope looking for Amoebae Chaos Carolinensis cuz that's the biggest single cell I've heard of with 5 cm diameter
1,"The original title was very clickbait-y, ""The Most Overhyped Monster on Earth"". Now it's been changed to ""The Most Horrible Parasite: Brain Eating Amoeba"", which is much better...for now."
1,Just always wear a nose plug.
1,Haven't seen a video from you guys so long! I almost thought you guys ran out of topics! Joy in tears!
1,Thankfully i am sick for waaaaay longer than this amoeba needs to kill you so i am safe and am slowly & agonizingly dying from something else entirely. That is currently completely and entriely unknown to me and is prolly entirely genetics related and caused by my entirely overpowerd immune system totaly overreacting. Causing it to use nukes to battle said wolves in a forest. Very powerful. But wrecks havoc. Thankfully much of me can easily survive such metaphorical nuke anyway. I think.
1,"There is a cure





It’s called skyrocket that shit until you can’t sniff"
1,The animation team is getting better
1,well it is time to use microphage
1,"The nickelodeon symbol, true existential dread"
1,I finally understand why people say not to do a netti pot with tap water
2,"lol I have a huge fear of parasites sickness and more lol lol *taps on it anyways*

0,This is what I call my depression

2,what the faaaack! :D loved it ty for all videos
1,"tf... bruh.. this is scary... why? why do this?...
the reassuring part comes waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too late...
I am sad now.."
1,Why yt recommended this video right after I just went in a pool skull
1,"Very occasionally? Less than 400 registered cases in 70 years is so miniscule that is shouldn't be even considered as a threat. Interesting problem, but that's it. Malaria or Ebola kills many more peoples in far less time. Sure not comparable as one is a parasite-like and others are viruses, but still. Miniscule."
1,"Me: ah, no homework. just...rest...stress free...
Kurzgesagt: Hello, there.
Me: Oh yea, ok what do you have for today?"
1, Among us refernc

0,hate how the human looks
1,apparently I had this when I was a few months old
2,Have a good summer !
1,"Damn, it must feel ripped off after paying all that effort just to see nothing but my two brain cells to eat."

1,I love some of the new parts to the animation style! Keep it up Kurzgesagt!
2,"nice vids, I like how they acknowledge the existential....."
2,I love the graphics
1,you should collaborate with dissplate for your poster
0,I am dead i’ve experienced what you said in the past month
1,"not truly horrible if a case is so rare. other parasites are common and really horrible too tho you dont die, it messes you up"
1,that mech advertisement whas actualy really creative :^D
1,"Kurzgesagt i dont know if you read comments, but right now we need this. Can you make a video on the prediction of a total societal collapse by 2040?"
1,"This amoeba, Rabies and Prions, are the most horrifying diseases out there.
You get infected with them: You're dead.
It's almost a certainty that you're going to die (Except with Prions, with them, it's a 100% certainty that you're going to die).
Curiously, they all affect the brain..."
1,What the comments doin'?
1,So basically I’m just never touching water again

1,"Run 500 meters for everytime the narrator said ""a war has been raging on for [time]'s of years."""
1,"hey algorithm, this is what we want."
1,The title did a full 180
2,"after swimming this is what i get recommended, great now im scared for my life."
1,"new update ,I very look forward these video.merci!"
1,"I guess this is why people always told me to not snort tap-water (btw I snort tap water to clear my sinuses (when I don't have any saline, at least)) from the hot tap. It's not as relevant today with modern boilers, but in old houses/outdated plumbing systems in the UK, the hot tap - as well as being an entirely separate faucet from the cold tap - used to draw its water supply from a big tank in the roof where the water would lay stagnant for long periods of time; a potential breeding ground for various organisms. This was OK for washing/bathing/cleaning, but not for consumption. Whereas the cold-water tap would be plumbed directly into the water mains. Of course modern boilers just heat water on the fly and from the same, fresh water source as the cold tap."
1," **sigh**

I am RUINED
Edit: 
It gets worse. I need help"
1,stop pulling red notes on society.

1,"As a paranoid individual. This gives me yet another reason to avoid the ocean and other bodies of water. As rare as it is, staying out of the environment guy l guarantees lack of contact entirely. It's bad enough being Australian and worrying about things like Cone Snails, Stone Fish, Box Jellyfish, Sharks and Crocs in the waters xD"
2,love the outro
1,Now that’s why you hold your nose when you dive
1,"I just swam this weekend and im feeling a fever, nausea, and headache so im freakin out but eh."
1,Lol I thought is zombie virus:)
1,even this amoeba's lore is more interesting than the shadowlands
1,"Thank you for giving us newest knowledge of science 
                               :)"
1,Is it just me or do some of the bacteria have among us visors?
1,A lie. Just as Always.
1,This feels like it was written exclusively for John Green.
1,Looks too innocent until it does eat the brain.
1,You have no right having animations this smooth and this detailed. Especially for this particular subject. No right!
1,Can't believe nobody is mentioning this was the final diagnosis in one of House M.D.'s best episodes ever: S02E20 & 21 Euphoria (part I & II)
1,What is that outro???
1,Well... I know what my nightmares are going to contain for a while now.
1,oh good i wont have an existensial crisis if i just buy murch! (spends 38 dollers) thanks kurzkanaght you cured my depression. very good plug strat if im going to be honest

1,mane i though this was gon be about bigfoot or that loch ness mf
0,"Marketing by using a personification of our existential dread and killing it. Brilliant sales tactics Kurzgesagt, my wallet will weep tonight"
2,This episode's animations... God I love it
2,"My good sir, friction you I wanted to sleep tonight"
1,Is there any common variable between the 3% of the people that do survive the parasite? I think the bubonic plague caused an evolutionary change in the people that survived it and now they also benefit from it for being more resistant to HIV.
1,"this takes ""im losing my braincells thanks to you"" to a whole new level"
0,Wow. Learning all the ways I could horribly die has never been so fun.
1,"Kurzgesagt, German name, English presenter... face_with_tears_of_joy

0,Im scared of pools now
1,Who’s here after the guy on the news
1,The animations are officially horrifying.
1,"There is a treatment for it. The issue is not lack of treatment. It's the timing. Many people are misdiagnosed with meningitis and treated for that while their symptoms continue to worsen. By the time they are taken to the hospital yet again, they are already on their deathbed. It's like rabies, except in this case, the onset of symptoms does not mean it's too late."
2,"Wow the animation is EVEN BETTER. I haven't seen your videos in years, your videos are very interesting and well made and I like how they're so detailed and intense"
1,I keep telling the DcArtemisUniverse to make a Cell vs Brain Eating Amoeba video but it still hasn't happened. I will continue to ask until it finally happens.
1,Maybe don't watch this in your lunch break

1,petition: extinct Naegleria fowleri
1,That was the best marketing ever! I feel that I have to buy that poster!
1,Is this parasite real and is it existing now?
1,"today i was sailing and for some dumb reason, when i was cleaning the boat, the water kinda smelt fresh. you know what i did? i bent down to sniff the water and it blasted high up my nose. the water was fresh and at room temputare (maybe a bit cold). Im so stupid."

1,Comment for algorithm
2,Straight Out Of 9Ho
1,I wanted to learn swimming and this comes damnn
2,"Great, a new nightmare."
1,"Don't worry, I don't think the hillbillies that swim in lakes with dead birds floating on top and pinworms that crawl up their urethra can get any stupider, so the ameba can't hurt them. And even if they do, the hillbillies won't know."
0,if this spreads to USA it will starve to death

1,"I haven’t watched Kurzgesagt in a while, and wow has it changed. The animation is more in depth and complex, and the poster ad at the end hit way different."
1,"In a simulated brain, I wonder what would happen if the brain was infected with rabies and this amoeba at the same time. Would they try to fight/eat each other? Or would they just pass through like they don't recognize each other? So many questions! Thank you for this frighteningly educational video :)"

1,Existential dred only shows up at the end to remind you that you feel guilty for attempting to replace god with science instead of understanding that science is proof of god.

1,"When I went to Ojo Calienté (translation is hot eye) mineral springs in northern New Mexico (just look for Taos) there is a lithium warm spring you are invited to drink from to improve your mood. As I was sipping, another tourist was saying it's all fine and dandy until you contract an amoeba. I told them that you don't get that from just drinking water, but that's why I grew up going to natural springs in the mountains of  NM and told not to submerge my head, where the water would flood my sinuses."

1,"I grew up near a nuclear power station and the lakes used for the cooling towers had TONS of ""NO SWIMMING"" signs in the area because the water is stirred up as hotter cooling tower water is cycled back into the lakes, and is one of the more common risky locations for contracting _N. fowleri_ . Funny part is that it sucks about as much for the amebae, since we are dead-end accidental hosts. I guess, at least they get one last good meal? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

1,"I absolutely love love LOVE the short with the existential dread character at the end. As a bit of a religious studies nerd, the impression I get about what the ""fear of God"" means in old Jewish theology seems to be a combination of that overwhelming feeling of dread plus the feeling of awe that the bird expresses at the end. Meanwhile, my working modern secular translation for ""fear of God"" is ""humbled by overwhelming truth,"" which happens to align with the scientific ""humbled by overwhelming evidence based on repeated measurements."""

1,"I overcome existential dread by doing everything in my power to move closer to becoming a robot fox in real life. I hate being rendered by trillions of tiny life forms (because at that point my body is just a society, and is at constant war with the world around itself). I don't want to be rendered by a society of cells, I want to be rendered by circuitry, even if I have to give up my ability to heal. At the end of the day, organic life feels as if it exists only because it is convenient for cellular organisms to clump together in order to be stronger as one unified organism. I'd rather be rendered by something less alive and more robust, which doesn't have to deal with the nature of organisms."
1,I'm happy I  the thought everything is meaningless and there's no point in anything. You can't be a failure when everything is pointless
1,"Identified since the 1960s (Fowler was an Australian pathologist). It is technically not classified as true amoeba, but a shapeshifting amoeboflagellate excavate [Wiki]. Acetyl choline is 'suspected' of being the attractant. Methods to deal with the possibility of its presence are understood and implemented in well cared for pools. Personal responsibility raises its ugly head again."

1,"every kurzgesagt video is; introduction to something big/deadly, answering what it is, giving horifying details about it and then saying something to calm the situation down."
1,This is why you need to close your nose when diving in lakes or rivers
2,when did you get so 3D. I love it.
1,"That parasite is so dangerous. We can only swim sometimes but don’t ever play splash or your brain will be in trouble. Also there’s a germ inside your noise too when you splash others or you. Your brain might lost your memories if you have a brain eater germ. Even when you almost drowned. When you feel that thing when it has a germ on your brain, you’ll be so painful and hurtful. That’s why you need to be careful. It’s actually dangerous for your body."

1,"I haven't seen a better self-promotion in my entire life. Wow. Watch the whole video, guys!"
1,I think we should stop making comparisons like you are more likely to drown then die from brain eating amoeba. Is that really the case or am i just more likely to be in water where this is never present? If it was given that brain eating amoeba was in the pool I was swimming in would the chance that I died from drowning still be more likely?
1,I can't swim anyway

1,"I would recommend that if you live or are going to a place with this ameba to check the water condition & if there is any warnings issued for the water you plan on visiting, most public water holes are being tested yearly & the results are public information.

The black guy doctor gets the disease, and almost dies.
But there's so much wrong information in that episode.

Like, doctor doesn't swim in any water, he gets it from a patient, and the patient himself never swam, he got it from a sprinkler ge had in his indoor garden.
And the treatment was easy once diagnosis was made, just a couple of pills or something... And the symptoms reverted pretty quickly."

1,Kurzgesagt: rambling about how this is one of the most dangerous things to exist but then just says oh but ur more likely to drown then get infected
1,I was i  a pool today and i swear so much water went up my nose. ah foock
1,"the timing of this is actually insane, I've been spending a few days trying to find scientific background for an infection based apocalypse to build my new story around! this seems spooky enough and yet not too otherworldly to work super well with the tone I had in mind (and the stuff I already have)! gonna do some more research on this and take some artistic liberties to fit it to my setting but I think this is pretty much it!
also great work as always <3"
2,Well that’s terrifying
1,It's way different than your normal video and... less good. Why so alarming for only 500 death? Why the black bloob pub at the end? Do you have a new director?
2,The music at the end was so fitting! And I loved the part about the existential dread.
1,I knew someone who got an Amoeba that damaged their vision in their eyes from swimming in a stream. Poor lad.
0,Existential Dread is quite a nicely designed character.  It seems like a seductive daemon : both looking evil and at same time smiling and empathising with your fear of itself.
0,The amoeba sisters want you dead
1,I hope my existential dread is a recurring character in these videos
0,"-I find it more disturbing that the death is not even directly caused by the actions of the amiba,but the immune sistem basically making the brain self destruct as an attempt to kill it!"
2,Love this kind of video!!
1,The perfect scheme: give every viewer existential dread then release a product to take away the existential dread
1,Huh. I guess this ISN'T a children's channel. Top-tier content nonetheless
1, the among us cell
1,I kinda wish you went into the 3% who survived. I heard one girl who was infected survived because the doctors put her into a freezer or cool environment which weakend the amoeba significantly and allowed it to die.
1,this must be a collab
1,"Are we machines made out of flesh? Or robots are humans but metalic.
That raised a question… what if we replace flesh in humans with metal and replace lungs and stomach with batteries?
After all lungs and proteins from food are all to create energy in your cells right? Can we replace that with electricity instead?"
0,FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT NEW ENEMY FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT KILL KILL LET NO BEAST TRIUMPH OVER MAN FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT KILL FIGHT
1,my nose got itchy when watching this
0,"Aww, poor exsistential dread, poor fellah, come on over here, I'll keep you employeed for the rest of my life."
1,Spoilers for next year's update/patch 12023 HE
1,At  theres a sus germ
1,This is how yasuo main were created
2,"Wow, i'm afraid of being alive!.
Thanks Kurtz =)"
1,"Try marijuana, weed to treat it... Inhale from mouth exhale from nose... That amoeba will surely forget what to do even if it makes its way to brain..."
1,good video but that dread ad at the end was pretty cringe
1,"This episode made me feel uneasy.
Not only because of the subject but because it seemed that it was playing on basic emotions (fear and joy) more than in previous videos. I would like it better if it were less emotional. Plus, I prefer the basic humans than the one showed in this episode. I find them more original."
1,I can watch these videos for hours
1,its amazing how much of the video was already explained in the book you made
1,"So if I go into the med field, I know a place I can work hard into without worrying about opposers"
1,Now i have to buy nose plugs grinning_face_with_sweat
1,FPI Open up BOOM BOOM face_with_tears_of_joy
0,They would starve to death if they infected me.
1,""" By sheer evolutionary bad luck "" 

Of course....    All evolutionary lucks....   all random...  all bare luck.."
1,"i love how the music goes from a curious tune to a chaotic, confused, alien shriek of nightmare fuel just like the visual imagery. amazing"
1,I did the math and correct me if I’m wrong but for the 2 towns that are basically the same town there is 7000 people. I did the math and got this prevent for a single person to get this. It is a 0.00057143% chance for one person to contract this in both of towns
1,This amoeba is like something you'd see on an episode of House M. D.
1,"I have an aunt that usually say to never splashes water in anyone, now that is more serious than i could ever thought. thanks God i was on pool more than one week ago, so i am calm

Obs: i will buy all posters just when i get an good job kkkkkkkkk so amazing"
1,"I really wish I didn't see this video ever. Now I never want to come in contact with fresh water, ponds, rivers, lakes and hot springs. But I also will feel unhappy in pipes, swimming pools, fountains and spas.

Thanks Kurzgesagt"
1,"""Some unlucky people will have to deal with it"" ...meaning die"
1,How do you make this not happen.
1,"I would buy + play a Kurzgesagt trivia game so hard. Similar to Jackbox trivia but science + world questions, birbs, and learning raising_hands"
2,i wish i didn’t watch this videoskull
1,This should have been a Halloween episode.
2,Great vid! Learned about this bad boy watching House when I was a kid and it freaked me out as much then as it does now. lol
1,"Ah sweet, natural horrors beyond my comprehension. Ah sweet, natural horrors beyond my comprehension."
1,I dont think this is Overhyped at all
0,Thanks im having spontanious panic attack..
1,"Took a visit to see some bonsai in fort Myers Florida and on the way home found out a 13-year-old was infected and he is now battling for his life.
Keep him in prayer..."
1,I already don’t like swimming in any publicly accessed water. Now I don’t even want to swim in a pool. Lol.
1,I wonder what this amoeba would do if it was casually eating bacteria while the bacteria are fighting your immune system
1,"As a frequent visitor of hot springs
*Chuckle* I'm in danger."
1,"No one:

The excuses I use to avoid working:"
1,Man I should really stop snorting stagnant fresh water
1,"ah there we go, now i'm never swimming again!"
1,I wonder if it’s possible for things to consume the brain and acquire the memories or knowledge of the persons brain
1,The animation has come so far its madgrinning_face_with_smiling_eyes
1," Among Us... Among Us??? AMONG US???!!! *AMMOOONNNGG USUSSUUSUSUSU!!!!""!""!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!* astonished_faceastonished_faceastonished_faceastonished_faceastonished_faceastonished_faceastonished_faceastonished_faceastonished_faceastonished_faceastonished_faceastonished_faceastonished_faceastonished_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_facehot_facehot_facehot_facehot_faceface_screaming_in_fearface_screaming_in_fearface_screaming_in_fearcold_facecold_facecold_facecold_facecold_facecold_facecold_facecold_facecold_facecold_facecold_facecold_facecold_facecold_faceface_screaming_in_fear"
2,Great video as always.
1,"Did you rename this video or the change thumbnail? The title was ""Most overhyped parasite of all time"" earlier."
2,That outro XD
1,Does anyone remember when Kurzgesagts videos taught informative and relevant knowledge? Such potential to be a great educator its really a shame they focus on scaring people for views.
1,Reading the title made me think Kurzgesagt was making a video about my ex wife
1,The production quality of this video is lit.
1,"I know that's not that recurrent, but now I have a new reason to don't like beach and pools"
1,"Amoeba don't eat my last 2 brain brain cells.. 
Oh wait I lost one more after watching Trump's cute face"
1, woah the animator got a raise for that one
1,"When the invader gets to the brain:
Immune system:
Start playing soviet march
Invader: OH no"
1,This is scary
1,"You guys just keep getting better and better with every video, loved the story telling and the visualization was stunning, and the ending was so wonderful. Thank you guys for all that you’re doing red_heart"
1,Man.... Its 1 am and now i cant sleep thinking about this
1,I live around a 10 minute drive from a city where this happens all too often. Its usually kids who get sick unfortunately and the city issues warnings to not bathe or drink from the water supply. This video makes this seem a lot scarier than I previously thought
1,Thats why i don't like nature and going outside
1,That little bit at the end of the video with the merch plug was so adorable
1,This video brought to you by the anti-swimming lobby.
1,Thanks a lot now I have a new thing to think about
1,"Damit... I just had a swim, water entered into my nose.."
1,Why did I watch this while eating HARIBO
1,"So there's a reason I didn't ask too many questions when I was taken in at the neurological department of my local hospital a few years back. I myself had just come down with a form of Lyme's Disease that lives in the fluids surrounding your brain and attacks the nervous system (great fun, lots of headache and fatigue for about a month and then suddenly half your face is paralyzed), just because I got bit by a minuscule infected arthropod while celebrating my birthday picnicking in the park. I learned that in the next room over was a guy who went swimming one day and ended up in the intensive care ward for about a week on life support because he was paralyzed from head to toe and so couldn't breathe and hardly pump his own blood.
At that point I decided I'd try to avoid learning about too many neurological diseases because there's a terrifying amount of them, there's basically nothing you can do to stop them, and holy crap the effects are always _extreme._"
1,nah I definitely should not have watched this video
1,"Just got back from Holidays on a Lake and a pool with warm water, water also got water into my nose from both places. Does anyone know how/where to check for this bacteria?"
1,Well this parasite wouldn't eat my brain coz I have too much random and anoying thoughts in there anybody would not like it literally even a zombie will spill it out
1,"Wooohooo! Well written and animated nightmares of my dreams, just what I needed! thanks Kurzgesagt! Anxiety Achievement Unlocked!"
1, so basically the immune system is... MERICA!
1,"Me as a swimmer: Ehh, what am i supposed to do? It's my future ._."
1,Well this made me think back to all those times I accidentally drank a huge gulp or ocean water.
1,"I love you're videos. Actually i just bought you're book ""immune"" it should arrive in about a week"
1,"you can even swallow it without any consequences
hepatitis, gastroenteritis, meningitis, fever, rash, and conjunctivitis left the chat"
1,This is the thing that will give me nightmares and always pay attention to the no diving signs at the swimming pool
1,"Holy smokes! I never swim in a lake again! By the way, aren't you part of public German broadcast (ZDF)? Then you have a budget of 7 billion €. No need to beg us for alms."
1,Some people still have to deal with it… just not for very long… woozy_face
1,Your contents are awesome I wonder why don’t you make it in multiple languages?
0,In India a guy died by this in kerla
1,"So they WERE right to cut holes on peoples brains to let the evil out, I mean relieve pressure."
2,This channel is excellent.
1,I could be wrong but I think my older brother got this and lived.
1,The last two minutes saved me from having a heart attack
1,I SHOULDN'T HAVE SEEN THIS. D:
1,So is not a parasite...
1,Merch in Spanish?...when
1,"As someone who dreams to become a scientist, I've been looking for more information about this type of diseases that don't have an actual treatment yet, imagine if we could find treatments for those in the future, many lives could be saved!"
0,New fear unlockedunlocked
1,I think my aunt died of this exact thing. She caught a brain disease in florida.
2,lol the end was beautiful
1,"OH GREAT, Another horrible creepy way to die.face_with_rolling_eyes"
0,"I had a brain amoeba once
The poor fella died of hunger"
1,Another thing to add to my list of reasons to avoid swimming in open water
1,Now im happy my pool is cold for no reason
1,Ngl animation now are on a next level specially that human parteyes
2,that last part lmao
1,"...what have you HEARD, Kurzgesagt?"
2,The ending was clean
1,From now I will never swim again
1,Battle was more Intense than marvel endgame
1,"Me: never again. Never in a lake, hot spring, river or pond. NEVER."
1,The video looks really well animated I can tell you must have spent a long time on it
1,New video yes!
1,Probably I’m favorite video from you guys the music was perfect and eerie keep it up beaming_face_with_smiling_eyesthumbs_up_medium-dark_skin_tone
2,"Stats are great, but that doesn't mean this didn't make me totally paranoid. Thanks."
2,"''Ha ha, good luck sleeping tonight''"
1,"This takes ""it's just a scratch"" to a whole other level skull"
1,"That might be the funniest ad I've ever seen. Hope it comes on that show that is a montage of ads of the year, usually just Super Bowl Commericals."
1,THE FPS IS AO HIGHBHH
0, HOLY SHIT THE GUARDS
1,I think it would be more common if more people had intense swimming sessions in random lakes and dirty pools. But I feel like most people don't do this.
1,The animation in this episode was crazy.
0,Welp ty for increasing my fear of water
1,  yellow among us moment
1,"Thank you Kurzgesagt, as always. But something seemed aesthetically displeasing in this video. Kurzgesagt’ style is changing. Those unnecessary headshots of the human making faces were ugly at best. Very creepy looking and contributed nothing to the storyline. And that last part of the video was so weird, different and long compared to the length of the actual good content. Whoever scripted this and thought that the narrator needed some support from his existential dread to do the sales pitch portion of the video… is probably new to this team."
1,Why did I watch this?
1,"its like a very obvious point to make but F*** it, Here we go:




ALWAY FINISH A KURZGESAGT VIDEO...... ALWAYS!










Now calm down and go have a swim in a lake"
0,very miss leading
1,Your animation is getting better and better with each video. Truly exceptional star-struck
1,Nuke it from orbit it’s the only way to be sure
2,"me: oh it's fine, there's probably some kind of super efficient cure
them: *97% of patients die*
me:






oh"
1,I am trying to process what i just witnessed
1,Is it October? This video feels like October.
1,The animations for this video in particular are 12/10. It’s so much more complex than some of the younger videos. Amazing stuff!
1,I think i woud have never touch water in my life if the Video did stop at  PS: great video
1,"OMG, even the last ad was beautifully edited and I could not skip it. Love and support your work!"
1,sponsored by William Gates
1,what about wayer shooting into your eye cavity from a diving board faceplant?crying_face
1,I really want to buy but unfortunately I can't afford
1,"So, we no brainers are safe from this right? face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy"
1,Yo kurzgesgt can you do a video about the water crisis or one on neutrinos
1,This animation is truly better then anything I’ve seen on YouTube
1,I want existential dread to be a recurring character
1,"Basically, brain-eating amoeba harvesting acetylcholine from brain cells is like a person taking candy from a baby except that the baby has to rely on the candy to survive."
2,Hurray
1,ahh... know I know why I only have 3 brain cells left
1,"
Haven’t watched this channel in about 5 years. When I tell you I was not expecting this-
 oh. Okay. grinning_face"
1,i've started to learn swimming but now this video is making me question if I should continue lol
1,"They couldn't kill me, they would starve to death."
2,I loved this video so much! And the end credit push for merch was hilarious face_with_tears_of_joy
1,"The Best Horor short film i saw all year , well done Kurzgesagt"
1,Existential dread cannot exist in the presence of awe. Nice!
1,"If it thrives in heat, surely the first step to take would be to find a way to cool the body to a very low temperature without causing permanent damage?"
1,It was on the House MD too
2,what a nice video !
1,I went in the ocean and I remembered this video when I got water in ma nose
1,"well thanks, im never going swimming again beaming_face_with_smiling_eyesthumbs_up"
1,"Overhyped?  I never heard of it.
(4 days later) Oh, I see, you changed the title from ""The Most Overhyped"" which at the time made me think everyone was somehow talking about it."
1, wait is that the amongus
1,We want more videos about space
1,"Is this what I have? How do I remove it? How do I detect it?
Should I just go to a hospital and ask to search for it?"
1,"Wow, explains most of the people I meet anyway. I just thought they were stupid. I daresay the amoebas didn't have full bellies though."
1,"The soundtrack is so unique on this video, props to Epic Mountain!"
2,Good thing that I only like swimming in cold waters
1,"Oh! A new video by Kurtzy? 

And it's not about the end of the world? 

It's something small and delightful? 

Oh this is how I'm going to die..."
1,Just wondering is there a way to cure this?
1,That ending is how you do advertising right.
1,Congratulations you perfectly ruined my summer vacation
2,"Wow, a new subject for my nightmares, thanks a lot!"
1,We humans are mostly stupid so our  immune cells would be too. it's a common thing.
1,"if teacher used this videos, the students will actually listen, the whole video looked like an epic battle of berlin scene"
1,"I was going to enroll for swimming lessons this summer. 




Not anymore"
1,fasinating
2,First I love your videos!
1,Even its 2022 i still keep seeing AMOGUS on animated cells
0,Worst merchandise advertising that I have seen. Was too far!
1,“I’m here to question your existans” I’m already doing that
1,Back when I was a kid my best friend got this amoeba.  It was very tough and he barely survived it but had lasting issues from all the surgeries.
1,The lies in the comments are crazy
1,What about the ocean.
1,"I'm stiLLLLLLLL in a dreAAAAAAAAAM,,, Brain EatEEEEEEEER rolling_on_the_floor_laughing"
2,Well this is horrifying
1,"An interesting question from someone who knows absolutely nothing about medicine: Do you think that cryogenics would be a possible way to cure this? If it hates the cold so much, we may be able to freeze someone for long enough to kill the amoeba, then thaw them out and revive them. The big problem with this would be if the thing is more resistant to being frozen solid than we are (which is likely), but it certainly would be worth a try considering the patient will die either way."
1,"Last time: Don't worry, we will overcome climate change and we'll be okay.
This time: An amoeba is going to eat your brain, and you WILL die."
1,"I feel like this video should have been released in the fall. Like, say, around the end of October."
1,I watched this just a yr ago and a story poped up where a 2yr old died to this and I remembered this video
1,"All doesnt seem that bad, if you know anyways that you will die one day. 
So, this bacteria can in worst case just fasten something what will happen anyways.

Good news is. Since we have a spirit which will live eternal, we dont have to fear death, if we are children of God.

Believe and Follow Jesus, who is the truth, and he will give you a new life, which is literally not from this world, but a life to Gods glory."
1,Thats it im never swimming in pools beach lakes
1,*I swear every time I get a migraine I think of this video*
1,"ah sweet, nature made horrors beyond my comprehension"
1,Now it is only natural to make a similar video on the deadliest virus in the world and promote vaccination in a single video. Rabies
1,"How is Existential Dread not a main or secondary character in this channel? Personally, he shows up after 9 out of 10 Kuzgesagt videos I've watched."
1,this is probably the scariest animated video i've watched in a very long time! Never swimming again :DDD
1,"i have a genuine question. I have done so much cocaine that my nasal septum is completely removed. for context I have can fit a whole thumb through it. My question is, will i be at a higher risk of the parasite entering into my brain?

I know its a weird ass question, but im genuinely curious"
1,but its 83 precent that there will be that Amoeba will come inside your brain because people help us check that is that lake is safe or not or maybe you have to look for your self and check yourself
1,I actually got a little bit scared
1,25th view
1,The idea that the narrator is a tubby duck is so funny to me
1,Fortunately it is really rare
1, is no one gonna talk about how that innume cell loks like an among us character
0,"Wow, the Amoeba is like an Anti brain weapon, a leftover of an ancient war between the ancestors of humans and the creatures that hunted them"
1,"Great video, though the music at the beginning is quite distracting to me"
1,"Who remembers when the title was ""the most overhyped monster - the brain eating amoeba"" or something very similar"
1,My God the animation has really come a long way..
1,WHY DID U POST THIS BEFORE PEAK SUMMER TIME
1,"Bruh, now I'm scared of swimming in our local rivers and ponds XD"
1,Some truly spectacular 3D effects!
1,"Can I ask what the point of this video was, other than give viewers an irrational phobia of bathing in warm climates? You usually educate about something important to know, or something to inspire awe, or to spread awareness of an issue. But what help does this knowledge give us? I felt uncomfortable with the title, but watched it anyway, because I was certain in a nutshell was spreading awareness for a reason. This just seems like a pointless effort at frightening people. Maybe I'm mistaken. Please explain?"
1,brooo the virus looks like the crimeras from terraria
1,"I'm never going close to fresh water environments again. you know, just in case.."
1,Forget about swimming in a warm pool...
1,"Spoilers: it was me.
Correction: NVM, it wasn’t."
1,The visuals is still getting better
0,damn bro dread hits hard :weary:
2,UMMMM can we talk about the CREDITS!!!! STUNNING!!!!!!
1,I did my research for school and this is accurate
1,"oh great, i didn't want to sleep tonight anyway..."
0,"Dangerous Amoeba be like:Hey can i eat youre brain cells?
Me:Oh hell nah."
1,Thanks for giving me something new to be scared off. Glad I never swim in natural lakes
1,I’m scared. I have a question though. Can you get it from showering? Also love the animation!
1,Let's just all except the amount of editing this must have taken
1,This is fascinating
1,"Amoeba : ""Survives by staying in the host"" 


Also amoeba to the host : ""So you have chosen death"""
1,Me after watching this video: I never wanna go in a pool or lake ever again
1,I wonder would keeping ur head in ice help ur body fight the amoebas
1,We have a whole world inside us that's crazy
1,PSA to neti pot users: only use distilled/purified water
1,you know how they say ignorance is bliss? i wont go to a pool again
1,Bro went from an unsuspecting bacteria  stuck in your nasal cavity to being a wanted brain terrorist in the span of a couple days
0,IF YOU KILL THE BIRB FROM THE EXISTENTIAL DREAD MOMENT BECOUSE YOU LIKE KILLING YOUR BIRBS I WILL COME AFTER YOU PERSONALLY HE IS TOO CUTE FOR HIM TO DIE
1,The new animation style with the humans isn’t my favorite. Maybe just change that I don’t like.
1,"I’m kinda scared of this
 Especially Cuase it’s recent"
1,Good thing i don't swim in pools xd
1,"...the animation really stepped up, huh? The eye reactions are... horribly good"
2,What a good episode!
1, This bird is precious and needs to be protected from existential dread at all costs.
1,"Bro the soundtrack for this video is a banger, certified hood classic"
1,Must resist Political jokes...... That Leftists all have this Parasite..... Must resist.....
1,Well...yeah actually that's all I have to say about this episode. I'm going to need a long break from the internet now.
1,Ok I understand I will never swim in a lake again :D
0,I rather die from the sun than this thing
1,"I lost my best friend for this amoeba 2 years ago and i truly still having nightmares about when he passed away  a big important part of my life left with him  we where friends  since kids and i was with him when he got the bacteria i was playing with him everything was ok everybody was having fun and  helping him relax bc he left his house a bit bc he was having family problems so we decides to  go to a pool to play, after that next morning he got sick and 3 days later it took his life on the hospital   the doctors said that he could be saved bc they find it soon but no one thought in 3 day could took his life on the visit time  i was with 3 more friends when he passed away  i just can't stand near water i used to love it, i still love it but  now i can't even touch it"
1,Note to self: Stay out of the lake.
1,The pool cleaning industry approves
1,Not this one is giving me anxiety
1,"I have a question! I'm actually doing a presentation on this amoeba, and I am confused about the infective stage. I was taught that the flagellated stage is the infective stage, but the CDC says it's the trophozoite stage that's infective. Wouldn't the amoeba need to be flagellated in order to travel up the olfactory nerve? And THEN morph into a trophozoite when it reaches the brain? I've seen different opinions on this, please let me know what you think!"
1,can't wait to literally never swim again
1,"what is fascinating is how you start picturing what exactly is going, your body desperately trying to stop the attackers literally throwing everything it has into a meat grinder in order to keep you alive. They all go into ""oh shit"" mode just like a country's army reacts when its capital  is under attack"
2,who did you hire for the 3d segments? they looks so good!
1,Existencial what? Am I the only one who thinks these guys are mentally ill? or do you all have that black thing in your mind? Don't get me wrong I totally love their videos but they are always talking about some kind of mental illness or sadness or something...
1,Have an micro-biology exam tomorrow morning and i was completely washed but as soon as I read about naegleria i remembered this video so i watched it again and guess what I am completely recharged thumbs_upthumbs_upthumbs_up love kurzgesagt

1,i cant swim slightly_smiling_face
1,Why did I start feeling sad for single celled organism in the immune system?
1,"I wonder if this amoeba will be able to feel acetylcholine if a person has lost his sense of smell after coronavirus? Theoretically, the receptors stop working and, accordingly, release acetylcholine to transmit information, or does it not work that way?"
1,just a thought after watching this can Brain Eating Amoebas be weponized if so should we be worried lol
1,"Anyone else watching this with basically all of the early symptoms?

Update: Nvm I just got covid"

2, that duck is so cute loudly_crying_face
1,The animation in this channel becomes better with every video! It’s amazing that we get can watch this for free on the internet.
1,"There is a cure for it but it’s too expensive for general hospitals to carry, therefor unless you are extremely lucky or catch it really early, you are basically screwed."

1,Bro I'm having like a headache and I had a little nausea for a second and I'm worried I have it lol
1,Not First One But On Time !
1,"If this scared you, please know that there are known bacterial predators of Naegleria! Unfortunately for you, these are Legionella. Yep, the bacteria that causes Legionnaire’s."
1,when we know its hurting us and our body would naturaly put out a fever bu what if we try and cool are body down to the max to help it win?
1,It actually isn't a amoeba
1,"human: what is going on?

2,That moth animation was great
1,Welp. Not like I was going swimming anytime soon anyway.
1,"Maybe colds can cure the amoeba because some bacteria rather die on coldness or hotness
And this bacteria doesnt die to hotness meaning it can probably get weaken to coldness."

1,"Dear mr exisistential crisis man whether I am actually alive is not really important. I feel and I can feel happy and I'd like to make myself happy as much as possible I don't need to know whether I am real or a computer program that is my purpose. Me being small compared to the universe is not really a big thing because I'm already small compared to the number of people already living here on earth alone this doesn't fill me with dread, I'm more concerned about what the 8 billion people might do than I am about what alpha centuri is up to. Yes there is a lot of stuff I don't know but even the best most intelligent people don't know how to do everything."
1,I actually saw this video on the german channel but couldnt understand it.

1, this literally looks like the nightmares I‘ve had since I‘ve been 5 years old
1,"boi, im going to a pool, and now im scared :("
1,It’s amazing how the animation improved over the years
1,"Regarding existential dread?  My apologies but no amount of cute graphics takes the edge off of the admittedly low-percentage change of having your brain being alive by a horde of heat-loving amoebae.  No seriously, in some states of the USA, those amoeba can be found lurking in tap water, particularly in hot water.  Just ask yourself, does your state have cold winters?  If not, do people routinely have boil orders and/or routinely instruct people on how to flush out and sanitize your hot water heater?  Or do people just tell you to ""fire it up all the way to 160 degrees F and let the heat take care of it""?

Short version short?  *Be VERY careful with what goes up your nose.*  Dermatologists have this one right, the T-zone, including your eyes and nose, are more than a bit of a hole in your immune system.  *DON'T do Neti Pots, ever,* especially not with tap water if you live in a warm-winter climate.  If you wouldn't do it because it's a COVID risk, then it  might also be a brain-eating amoeba risk for the same reason."
1,Was that PewDiePie?  
1,"If after watching one of your videos I'm left with some new fears (existencial or physical), it was a good video.
Ps: It was a very good video"

1,"Don't lie to me, is that Neil Degrasse Tyson voicing Existential Dread?"
1,"""some unlucky people have to deal with it""

deal with it = die from it in about a week"
2,"Lmao, existential dread became a character"
0,So the body fights invisible wars everyday? Thank you immune system!
1,"As climate change worsens and the weather gets hotter, we'll probably see a ton more people get infected with this."
1," : Ho ! They drew a nose ! That is unusual.
 : Ho. No. Please. No. .__."
1,"You start the timeline as ""pool fun"".  Savage grimacing_face"
1,It's amazing how the chemicals in our brain and other parts of the body act like they are an organism of their own and can think i.e are programmed to carry out functions even without having a brain of their own. Like the neutrophils exploding themselves to form a barrier in the brain against the amoeba with deadly chemicals.
1,"There are lotta things we don't know, I wish I could live for 1000 years to explore few stuff"

1,yes indeed... this spreads unnecessary fear... it is a very low occuring disease... like this you must also make video on other diseases... will you?

1,So in other words this virus just makes you a redditor
1,"Sry but I disliked the vid.

Why? Because the last part about the real danger really should be the beginning. And the title/thumbnail also should clear that up much earlier (I think you had a thumbnail that did when you released it a bit ago?)

Putting that part at the end just unnecessarily stokes fears and bad thoughts for no good reason... pls do better :)"

1,Jesus christ this video was terrifying.
2,Great video as always
1,This ad segment in the end is awesome!
1,This is exactly what I did last week and now I'm worried. It was from a friend's swimming pool which looks like it wasn't clean regularly and we live in a country where temperatures are high. I dove like 3 times in it. I'll be fine right? flushed_face I didn't have a fever so far nor headache. This will definitely make me more hesitant to swim from now.

1,The Medical System had planned this years ago when they no longer allowed a person to call in for a Parasite prescription.

1,"97 % of the recognised cases die...
But actually most of the cases doesn't reach severity. 
Try healthy diet, moderation is key. Exercise, try to stay away from alcohol and smoking, 
Give you immune system boosts now and then. How?
Follow ayurveda. Initially it helps.
Once in grip of deadly disease no one can help.
Note try not to get hypertension and diabetes. And if your family have history of such disease chk yourself regularly and take help from ayurveda and exercise and diet.
If not then you have modern science help waiting to rip you off"

0,Great I'm going to a lake and your ruining it.. I blame u
1,"So in short as long as you have a good and strong immune system to prevent the parasite from beating them, you are less likely to get your brain eaten?"
0,This was a horror story but whatevz
1,"I once traveled for a vacation and dove in pools at hot springs having no worry at all. Then just as I was leaving the hot springs I noticed a small sign warning about the brain-eating amoeba. I was like ""D:"" for a few days but hey I'm still kicking.

Also existential dread kinda soothes me when I have rough time irl. I brings it all to perspective, it doesn't matter THAT much after all. :)"
1,Just watched an episode of Dr. House with this parasite. It was horrible.

1,"Imagine if the people that does Covid testing (where they insert a stick into your nose) started to put Amoeba on the stick, they could kill thousands!"
1,You make the human body look so cute and beautiful even though we all know its all slimey and congested inside. Makes it interesting to watch!
1,why is the word amoebae so funny
1,Now I’m never gonna go into another lake or a swimming pool now lol
1,"I love Kurzgesagt, but I have a piece of feedback that will be less-than-praising. I think this is a fascinating subject but I also think it's worth considering the amount of time spent in this video talking about ""this is a terrible, horrifying thing that could happen to you"" vs. ""this is how unlikely that thing is to actually happen"". Is it 80% vs 20%? 90% vs 10%? 95% vs 5%?"
1,We can all agree together as a community that this channel teaches us more than we learn in middle school
1,"And here I am from the land of 10,000 lakes...tired_facetired_face"
1,stranger things but small

Wired: Naegleria Fowleri will eat your brain and the brains of your loved ones if you even glance at the water."
1,"*Yo this monster is so ""braindead"" it's needs to be nerfed*"
1,"The existential dread reminds me of the Fear episode of Adventure Time. Where we find out Finn is afraid of the Ocean, a pretty common and understandable fear actually.  <3"
1,Imagine watching this because you just learned you have brain eating amoebas.
2,nice boss fight music

1,"I'll stick with chlorinated pools, thank you."
2,Interesting but great video
2,it’s like the lottery you don’t want to win
1,"The statistics theory isn't very convincing, considering I'm someone who has inherited a combination of diseases like migraines, raynauds disease, anemia, lung and skin issues, and cartilage inflamation, even though living a very healthy lifestyle. Not to spread fear, but the unlucky person could be anyone of the people watching this video."

1,"Man I hate this video, not only do you see Kurzgesagt humans but you see ""graphic"" (in Kurzgesagt terms at least) detail about how the amoeba can kill you, but after about 8 minutes of anxiety, they tell us to not be concerned about it :'( well now I'm anxious about swimming and tiny bugs with 8 mouths"
1,Brain Eating Amoeba parasite video from Kurzgesagt? Me eating my dinner? A perfect combo!
1,"Normally a Kurzgesagt video will make me go ""woah, cool! I never knew that."" Same thing goes in this case, along with ""I now have a fear of swimming.."""

nice"

1,I will forever be terrified of water getting inside my nose now. Thanks face_with_tears_of_joy

2,"Kurzgasagt has started having post credit scenes now lol....
And I love it"
2,This is so informative!!! Fantastic reporting; I love this kind of content! The graphics were amazing If scary!sunflowerblossomhoneybee
1,what if the reason is that it has developed to be almost exactly like our immune cells
1,"Real takeaway from this: protect your nose.
Olfactory nerve array is one of the few shortcuts that bypasses the majority of defensive measures that usually stops most incursions to your single most important organ. It's essentially your brain seeping out a bit to sense outside world there(same as eyes, but you are inclined to protect the eye more, and you do get more physical distance for the invaders to traverse. Ears are airgapped ish). Don't pick your nose(may push contaninants deeper), don't remove nose hairs(removes first line of defense against nasal cavity. Also risk of inflammation), Don't submerge the entire nasal cavity(you'll instinctly avoid it most of the time I guess. If not - you should be exhaling very slowly through your nose to keep the water out). PROTECT YOUR NOSE."
1,", we’re all gonna need bigger skulls for this folks"
1,"Ah yes, the proto-Zombie virus.

Seriously, this is the closest to Eldritch Horror we are going to get (at least on Earth)."

2,"Great, now im afraid of water. What next?"
0,thanks for the new phobia
1,"I would die protecting little kurzgesagt birb, that was adorable"
1,"If you are worried about this thing, just remember a few things.
1. The information in this video
2.The cdc has information on it. Do some research there
3. There are diseases way worse than this. This list includes malaria, HIV, tetanus, cancer, etc.
4. More people die from natural disasters a year than this little critter in 30 years.
5. Pollution, something around you all the time, kills 7 million people a year. That is way more than 2-3 a year, which is what this critter does.

In conclusion, it is important to understand this thing exists, just understand that it is a rare disease and there are way more fatal and common things."
2,God I'm terrified of this thing and I'm glad to see it explained. Thanks Kurzgesagt!
0,I'm fucking terrified

1,Biggest epidemy ever noticed was during 1963-1965 in Czechoslovakian town Ústí nad Labem (its 30 km from the place i was born). 16 people died from contaminated swimming pool. 16 in 2 years in over 100 000 population of that city! and its THE BIGGEST.

1,"Sadly, a few years ago, one of my baby brother’s classmates died from this amoeba. His sister had also been infected, but after the boy passed away, they conducted an autopsy and were then made aware of what they had, and the girl survived! But now after this video, I am extra curious what the medical professionals did to save her."

1,Can you make a video on building another space structures
1,"dont want existential dread, just keep buyin"

1,Where I lived this amoeba got into our water supply like 8 times over the 5 years i lived there.
1,"JESUS CHRIST IS LORD. HE LOVES YOU; BEFORE THE WORLD BEGAN, HE KNEW YOU. REPENT AND BELIEVE THE GOSPEL."

I wish you all the best and thanks for reading. hope i can still comment back after 2weeks
1,so just plug your nose and your findsmiling_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,"Now that is one way to make your posters and other merch even more appealing.

First: Induce us with existential dread through an interesting video. 

Then: Give us the cutest little animated dialogue with said dread and sell your work as a cure. 

If your stuff wasnt so amazing and if actually engaging and learning things wasnt actually able to improve quality of life.

 I'd consider this very much immoral. But you get a pass red_heart"
1,Time to never go near water again.

1,Finally an explanation for the Parasyte anime.
1,Kurzgesagt's animation never fails to amaze us
1,First time you got the eyes right!
1,"My favourite part is when all the immune system and fighting bacteria sprint to the brain, and have an all out war with the Amoeba. My boys got my back."
1,31 after 57 seconds
1,That Merch Pitch... absolutely impressive.
1,"I never thought Kurzgesagt needed much in the way of improvement, but you all found a way to knock that out of the park too. Incredible quality"

Has kurzgesagt finally embraced their inner horror studio? Or maybe they are finally embracing the existential dread they comes with the videos?"
2,Yooo I love the new anomation it’s realistic and cool!

1,"I think that it would be really cool if you guys made a video on the large hadron collider. Also, this video was 50x more terrifying than any horror movie ever created"
0,Okay now I will always be scared when I bath :(
0,"Thanks, Kurzgesagt, now I have one more phobia"
1,Fact: so you really think it was that scary well it’s actually really hard to get its 1/1.500.000.000 chance to get so it’s not scary
1,Alright so...if i just blow the water out of my nose i will be just fine right?
1,"About 2 years ago I read an article about a man who died a week after swimming in a lake, because an amoeba ate his brain. Tho according to the article the amoeba would’ve swum up his penis, eventually reaching his brain. Now my question is, are there indeed other less-likely tracks one of these amoebas can take, was the article inaccurate or are there other brain-eating amoeba species in lakes which take other routes?"
1,A comment for the algorithms!
2,"Hey! Loved the video, terrified of that amoeba and kind of liked existential dread's deep voice. I think having more vids of some kind of chat between duck and existential dread could be very interesting and pleasing to the ear."
1,Thanks I'm never touching water again
1,I'm not fucking going to swim anymore
1,Now I’m actually scared to go swimming woman_swimming
1,"I hope this doesn't happen to me, or my children."

1,Well-researched video!
1,"Cute Kurzgesagt bird! Look at him, he's so chubby."
1,I’ve never seen anything that so perfectly describes existential crisis better than this video. The existential crisis even showed up at the end like I almost had a heart attack
0,i want to sucker punch amoeba in the face

1,WAIT WHAT?! I thought the black duck was the narrator!

1,when ur brain already has another disease...
0,Fucking civil war
1,"Thankfully, I'm too scared to submerge completely, so I find it's a very low chance for it to affect me too much."
0,Biology is so fucking insane..
1,"This channel seems to often waste time and resources on complex, relatively pointless biological science niche videos.  I feel your time is so much better spent educating and reaching out on more important things instead of clever animations about fringe diseases.  You really hit it out of the park in the past on climate change, politics, and other explainers.  Stick to that instead of microbiology."
1,I made the mistake of watching this high and it made me SOOOOO anxious grimacing_faceface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy
1,"I’ve never shat myself watching a Kurzgezazt video before, but"
1,Never dive again not swimgrinning_face_with_sweat
1,Woah! The quality of videos evolved!
1,The scariest part of this video is hearing a voice other than the narrator
2,"so entertaining, and you guys leveled up again on the production value, thanks for everything!"
1,This is interesting because if a bacteria can eat away causing you to lose who you are and other motor functions. Then consciousness is data saved biologically and then the whole notion of a after life is destroyed. Is it all brain chemistry in the end? I think something was in that drink I had earlier..grinning_face_with_sweat
1,"isn't it weirdly ironic that this deadly amoeba, something that horrifies us, can destroy the very parts of our brain that makes us fear it in the first place."
2,the dread animation HAHAHA
1,"judging by the people on twitter, i don't think most people even have to worry about naegleria fowleri"
1,pls stop giving us more things to worry about
1,"Can you make a video on what would happen if we were to split a paor of quarks, or spilt one quark in half? I know it is impossible (at least for the time being), but everything does something when something happens, so there must be some way to figure it out. Right?"
1,I didn't plan on sleeping anyway. Ever.
1,"I waa expecting an audible ad, not a poster ad"

1,I never will have contact with water again
1,"kurzgesagt as much as i love you, you are the source for a lot of my existential dread"
2,The music in this episode was freakin great.
1,"Thumbnails and titles are getting a liiiiittle too internet click fishing for me. I’m glad Kurzgesagt is getting so so popular, but since they’re educational, I prefer knowing exactly what topic I’m clicking on.. that and I really don’t wanna see us become “one of those” channels.."

1,"So Carrion irl but is a tiny cell that can split into more of itself, great, terrifying."
1,another reason to stop watching youtube. just showed up.... remember those beutifull 10 minutes before I clicked this? it was precious
1,"birds are NOT smart.

Kurzgesagt: hold my chemicals"
0,"""Some unlucky people have to deal with it"". Yeah they have to fucking die."
1,"While this is scary, I just want people to know it’s not really worth worrying about. It’s a lot like shark attacks. Shark attacks are very scary and dangerous, but more people die each year trying to put their pants on."
1,I have a headache disappointed_face
1,i just want one video about the narrator like the stanley parable
1,OMG SO SCARY!!!! I'M NOT GOING IN WATER AGAIN!!!!face_screaming_in_fear

1,Very natural...
1,bro wat if inject bacteriophages
1,If we can eradicate NTDs then I'm sure humans can find a way to destroy this parasite.
1,"A 2 yr old baby died from this recently, in an old splash pad [ that is in a regular park ] , in my hometown . Not cleaned well.. sad .. I've been researching about it since then. 
I remember seeing the House episode, but didn't peak my interest, until now, that I have a 2 year old of my own pleading_face
Thank you for this video!"

1,I miss 10 seconds ago when I forgot this thing existed
1,the way the Amoeba is portrayed here is *very* reminiscent of the monster from Carrion
1,So can I still swim in chlorinated water
1,"why did i see this video at night, now im not gonna sleep"
1,This parasite almost killed doctor forman in House MD
1,"Imagine covid19 infects/combines with this amoeba... End of humanity in months

Yeah I know it's impossible"
0,damn this was an intense fight
1,congrat you have made a flodian never want to go into the water
0,It got into my brain nd died of hunger
1,What if it controls people
1,What's the meds to counter this?
1,This amoeba feeds on brain cells... i guess flat-earthers and anti-vaccines are immune to it ^^
1,omggg is this amogavirus on  ???????
1,"So basically
-it has to specifically get to your nose and those particular cells
-bro is just addicted to acetilcoline, doesn't know it hurts you"
1,Plus I think your immune system should be more carful and smart
2,The animation in this episode was some of the best OK_hand
1,when the amoeba boys become competent villans .
1,This is the biological equivalent of quicksand. I'm way too concerned about this threat
2,"Wow, the animation keeps getting better and better. exploding_head"
0,Poor guy finna starve.
1,I dont swim in the  biche
1,The animation in this one was truly next level!
1,"Inst the awser pretty simple ?
Humans back in the stone age problaby enjoyed them selfs in lakes like we do and there were no treated pools and it took dacades to us to get to were so ameba problaby evolved to fithg us as our imune sistem ware problaby not as evolved back then"
1,"Till 7 min conclusion you die a horrific death.
At  min don't worry It is not easy."
1,I don't believe a damn thing scientist have to say.  Science has become utterly corrupted by grant dollars.
1,"Bloody hell, how are humans even alive... It's like getting bit by a venomous snake, rare but if it happens you are for sure dead..."
1,"Okay okay, everyone is talking about scary amoeba, but DAMN THIS SOUNDTRACK!! Is amazing!
Also I'm very happy that existential dread can speak now xD"
1,I'm convinced Kurzgesagt has deeply repressed sadistict tendencies for releasing a video like this just before the summer.
1,The mucosa after masacer:ohhhhhhhh so thats was a enmyface_with_open_mouthface_with_tears_of_joy
1,I was watching this and was like bruhh chill...
2,Your animations are keeps getting better and better
1,"One of my favorite professors in Medical School loved to talk about this Amoeba in particular. One advice he always gave us was to always blow air out of your nose or at least pinch it close whenever you go diving/jumping into water. It’s pretty rare to get infected by these bugs as the video said, but still a fascinating subject nonetheless!"
1,And..... now I have Hydrophobia....
1,You should do an episode on prion disease and the brain as well. Chronic wasting disease is scary.
2,"that ending is what made me like it, love the content"
2,"Well great, i just got stuff up my nose and now i have to live in fear"
2,thanks for the paranoia
1,Thanks for hydrophobia. Ill never touch a pool again.
1,can we just talk about the absolutely insane jump in animation quality from kurzgesagt over the last few videos? loving it
1,we need more of the existential dread character lol
2,"I love this show
-Gir"
1,"Perfect timing, thank you for this! I have a report this coming Friday about the parasitic infections in the human body and naegleria fowleri is one of them, now I have more info to share!"
1,The quality of these videos is just increasing.
1,"The quality of your videos never ceases to amaze me... a big thank you to the Kurzgesagt Team!
Very nice outro slightly_smiling_face"
1,My Enemy Has It Yet He Doesn't Have A Brain Anyway So It Will Only Rot And Evolve To His Brain.
0,Having an evil depictured in low framerate really does settle that dread of terrible device performance. 4K60 is my brain barrier!
1,"Reverse Psychology Ending for Teh Responsible and Authentic Me, Thanks Me."
1,"So your telling me that like the space rock or destiny, god or something just went like

???: ""Oh yeah there's this really dangerous Amoeba that's really strong but don't worry it doesn't want anything to do with you""

Humanity: ""Oh. That's good, is there anything else?""

???: ""Oh yeah there's also this thing just happens to have the same receptors as yours that pickup these messenger thing's and they really like those thing's so they'll just barge into your brain and  destroy everything""

…

???: ""Yeah just by chance"""
1,so picking your nose can actually save your life
1,The sound design has been buffed up and the animation quality somehow got better.
1,He showed himself TO me.
1,The animation got way crazier
1,"I am your oldest subscriber of your from 5 years and I always wait for you videos

red_heart Love you from India India"
1,"How many of you already knew of the brain eater.  Well if you didn't, you should have.  After all, it was a no-brainer."
1,"had a cousin that died cause of that, we never knew how he got infected, he was into intensive care for two months. He just fell sleep cause he felt bad and never woke up."
1,"In my home town, 2 kids died 10 or so years ago from this thing swimming in the lake my grandparents live on, it was fucking awful."
1,and people say I look dumb when I close my nostrils with my fingers before jumping in the water...
1,Anyone else mistakenly think Kurzgesagt was getting a bit SCP before watching the video?
1,"Beautiful animation. I did not even know that Neutrophils can pull on pathogens to rip them apart. They're good at their job; after all they are ""Cells at Work."" I read the Immune book by kurzgesagt, and learned so much about immunobiology and cell communication amongst other things. Please write another book, I also enjoyed the anime references in it too."
1,This video actually made me less scared of the brain eating amoeba. Existential dread overcame!
0, i think i just shit myself out of fear oh well lets continue watching
1,"Now this seems like a title for Chubbyemu: ""A man swim in a lake in 1 hour, this is what happened to his brain"""
0,Kurgesagt fighting an existential dread he made is... Ok?
2,That might be the best merch ad I've seen in a long time xD
1,"there's another amoeba that feeds on brains/nerve tissue called acanthamoeba that is becoming more prevalent around the world 

it can eat your eyes and make you go blind if you wear contacts


source: I'm blind"
1,"Nobody:
What mothers think happens when you play video games:"
1,"We get big scares about brain-eating amoebas every summer in my area, and a lot of misinformation along with them. Good to know that drinking freshwater isn't how it's contracted, because that seems to b the main fear."
1,Brain eating amoeba vs prion. Who will win?
1,Press F to pay respect and a moment of silence for them who are being the observation subject to get suffer from this tiny guy
2,This is proof there is no god
1,The animation is so fckng smooth!!!
1,I want to preserve my brain
1,"I was believed to inhale this pathogen when I was young. I’m glad I wasn’t  infected, even though that chances are low."
1,"But wait,if its still in your nose,not touching the olfactory of nerve cells yet,can you like blow it out like aggressive exhale?"
2,I love how Epic Mountain creates the perfect music for Kurzgesagt's perfect videos. Truly a Godly duo.
1,That advert at the end was fantastic!
1,"me using my brain and understanding that the sea water has salt in it so the bacterias cant grow 
me also knowing i am a teenager and know nothing about this world"
1,Just when you thought it was safe to snort pond water.
0,"Poor Dread, it only wanted to consume and destroy every concept of being :("
1,"In this week's episode of Kurzgesagt, we present to you: *anxiety!*
Fortunately I don't bathe in places where these tiny little monsters live."
1,"Hey question, Whose narrated these videos? They're all so interesting and I've been wondering for a long while whose narrated them."
1,p sure this is the guy in the pool at disney-world...  :)
2,TY needed a day brightener.
0,It's tough being a human being!!
1,I live next to a beach so I don’t have to worry

You mean Twitter?"
2,lmao the best self-promotion ever!
1, this amazing animation is new…
1,"As a Floridian who swims in our lakes and rivers, we're pretty wary of all the dangers our waters have between the gators and sharks, but every now and then a tourist gets unalived by an amoeba"
2,I love his English accent
2,"How they advertise the posters
Its just too good"
1,"So I think you should also have a bad immune system to contract the disease, it's very likely that more other than 381 people inhaled this ameoba but it has been killed by the immune system"
1,"My animation sense is tingling, there's some new talent here, especially the last promo part"
0,I think I should just fear life
2,You are all so lovely! The final part was really cute.
0,"Got one of these things before, poor thing starved to death"
1,"Basically its just some really tough guys who got super confused and invaded a facility, causing the guards to create mayhem when trying to stop them."
2,I love the music
1,Wow I managed to be online as they upload a new video.
1,I use a swimming mask that has a nose protecter
1,"vent a little. when I woke up from sleeping with my cat, I felt itchy in my nose (maybe because of the cat's hair), I also inhaled water (raw water) until my head felt dizzy. then I remembered about the kurzgesagt video discussing Brain Eating, then I was worried..."
1,It looks like the monster from carrion
1,I love how the ape at the beginning always holds something relevant to the video
1,",,I'm here to make you question your own existance and everything you hold dear in life''
,,Could you not please?''
,,too late...''"
1,"So, you're telling me this can only infect me if water goes up my nose? That's a relief. For a second, I thought I'd have to stop drinking raw seawater over this."
2,the pool at the hotel is so clean it smells like bleach
1,"Just our bad luck that our brains happen to taste like delicious pond bacteria, I suppose."
1,"noice

btw nice new faceless voice"
1,Never knew i need a anime bird but appreciated 
1,I miss 11 minutes ago when I didn't know this existed
1,i'm all good bro. I can easily bash an mf smaller than a grain of sandsmiling_face_with_horns
1,Never been this early before!
1,I’ll never go near the water ever again face_with_tears_of_joy
1,LMAO the ad skit at the end was comedy gold rolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughing
1,"Well, that was horrifying.  a small microbe that we interact with pretty often and have little trouble with is basically unstoppable if it gets up your nose, and you won't notice anything wrong until its way too late.........thank god this is rare."
1,"Me, watching while I have a fever and just vomited- oh I haven’t swam in a while I’ll be fine…


Memory- remember u just came back from camp that is on a lake? The lake was warm. Ur gonna die probably."
1,why is the brain eating amoeba?? what did it do to deserve this
1,"I love my anxiety call ""never go swimming again""and my brain is not ok while watching thissmiling_face_with_hearts"
2,Thanks for this.
1,Oh no I never accidentally drank sea water fearful_face
1,"Yep, I am never going to go swimming again."
1,I see why Z&Z jewelry and stones watches this should there on Facebook lol
1,"Imagine if you could reprogram them to be symbiotic with our bodies and hunt harmful bacteria/viruses or possibly cancer cells. But, that also sounds like the plot of ""I am legend""."
0,That ending was pretty bad :/
1,How about using bacteria phages?
1,We finally see the narrator bird :D
1,Never clicked so fast in my entire YouTube history
1,"'...and every year, some people have to deal with it' ...deal with it...by which you mean die."
1,I grew up by the ocean so swimming in salt water never bothered be. Never was close to fresh water and honestly before this video I was already terrified of it. So thanks lol
1,"Right timing, new nightmare just before bed time face_with_tears_of_joy"
1,Kurzgesagt's own Bird Oc? awesome i love how round he is
1,So what just wear a nose plug when u go into a lake?
0,I'm So fucking scared i can't describe it
1,I don’t like the new art. Pupil-less Ducks and non-emotive segmented human beings are cute and simple and that’s the way I likes it!!
1,I didn't really like this video
1,lol I guess I'm not swimming ever again
1,I’ve scared a lot of people by bringing up that Euphoria episode of House M.D. where a cop and staff member got brain eating amoebas from bird poop. Duckman Cycles and VW Garage promised to eat duck poop when he hit a certain subscriber milestone but called the whole thing off when I reminded him of that episode. Guess I’ve been fear-mongering with the worst of them!
2,Great... now i'm not sure i want to swim anymore...
1,Sounds like a nose plug would go a long ways in assuring safety from this ameboid
2,Wow cool but... ue idk
1,I always wondered about this. Thanks for the video. Back to nose plugs?
1,Your animation quality has improved so much
1,Imagine having a itch in you’re brain-
1,"I like how the animation in this video keeps getting better and better, also you moving away from the corporate art style roots"
1,"So our immune is actually good to deal with them. But some someone or something not evol enough or missing some dna make them deadly then. If not, most animal die by this little brain eater already."
1,"Perhaps flooding other parts of the body (like the nasal cavity or stomache) with Acetylcholine may trick the amoeba to retreat into said parts, then you might be able to kill it?"
1,Brain eaters
0,"thank you kurzgesagt, youve ruined my summer"
2,A video like this about Rabies would be very interesting and educational!
2,"Well, that’s ruined summer, thanks!"
1,That bird with existential crisis friend had the prettiest Kurzgesagt bird face ever
1,"I remember first hearing about this when I saw a sign warning about it when going into some hot springs. A friend told me it only really enters the brain if you have a certain birth defect that makes it easier for the amoeba to reach the brain, but I don't know where they got that from and haven't been able to find anything about that specifically."
1,Animation quality sky rocketed
1,Where is the Arabic language?
1,"Introducing:
Parasyte: The Maxim"
1,You can also get this virus by watching cringe videos lol
1,NO BECAUSE THE DUDE WHO GOT THE NEGLARIA FOWLERI INFECTION LOOKS LITERALLY EXACTLY LIKE ME HELP-

*oh come on guys, you have one job*"
2,not sure if this is new human animation but damn its good
1,"Guy: *chuckles* I’m in danger
Kurzgesagt: ye ima make a reference to that"
1,Plz tell me that it's a giant lie
1,welp now i'm scared of jumping into pools thanks ;D
1,I will never take a bath in a lake again
2,Love this channel so much
1,"Damn, the animations are gorgeous now, it's been a while since i last watch one ,well done people!"
1,"No need to be scared,more people have died from cooking on their own spit than this Amoeba in the last 50 years because its that rare for it to actually find your Nerve Cells or get through the first lines of defenses after your nerve cells."
1,Just a reminder that this is extremely rare and there are on average ten cases per year and only 387 case since 1937.
1,And that's why I always wear goggles with a nose covering when swimming!
2,great music in this one!
1,What will happen if the entire ocean was filled with human blood?
1,The most exciting topic in relation to the red_heartred_heartred_heartred_heartimmune systemred_heartthumbs_up
0,"thanks for a new phobia, I guess"
1,I wish you covered the macroscopic end more. The first week is flu like symptoms. Into the second week you get neurological symptoms. At that point mortality rate is 99%. It's better to recognize it within that first week
1,Guess I'm not swimming ever again. Or just come in contact with water at all.
1,"Hey kurzgesagt, I'm a big fan of yours for years now. I just love the effort thr whole team puts for every video and the quality turns out always amazing. I hope you see my comment so it'd cheer you up perhaps."
1,Im addicted to the dread from these videos
1,Why did the way he describe the immune system’s battle with the amoeba remind me of making a last stand as the defending team on the last objective in Battlefield 1
1,The animation skill is amazing.
1,Some gigachad at kurzgesagt named this video 'most overrated monster' earlier
1,The microscopic world is in a constant state of Battle Royale.
1,"I was worried until he told how few have gotten it in almost a hundred years lol, anyone else?"
1,Twitter is the real brain eater
1,i don't have a brain to begin with
1,i'd never thought that kurzgesagt would add realistic humans
1,Thought this was about social media  posting
1,HOLY CRAP the animation on this one was good
1,"I remember when I was a kid growing up in Florida that in ponds, there were often signs that said not to put your head under the water because of amoeba. I always wonder why. Now, I'll never question them again."
2,I lost a friend because of this amoeba
1,"If Naegleria Fowleri likes heat so much what would cooling the brain do to it? because it seem like our brain is surprisingly tolerant of being cooled down (especially in a medical setting). Also, it seem that the rise in cranial pressure crushing vital brain areas is what usually does people in. So what if we temporarily remove the skull cap and replace it with a flexible membrane (to keep all the brain stuff in and everything else out) so the brain can swell unabated (I mean, assuming that just draining the excess fluid off by a catheter isn't a good option for some reason)? I get that it's kind of extreme but death is more extreme. It would be nice if we could find an amibophage for it."
1,"the last bit is intresting because i feel like the way my inner dread and nihilism overcomes me, but than kurzgesagt turns that into curiosity."
1,its like venom the scary black slop
1,this reminds me of the game carrionsmiling_face_with_smiling_eyes
0,"god may judge you, but his sins outnumber your own."
2,"As a person who loves going to pools and beaches, I'm glad that I didn't suffered from this illness. I would have imagined on how bad I feel when it happened to me."
1,I saw this parasite on the Animal Planet show Monsters Inside me
1,"If you account for the fact that millions, if not a few hundred million of interactions happen across all 90 or so days of summer. The amount of reported cases across even 1 summer, let alone 60 years of summer. Then the odds of getting this virus is infintecimally small. So small, that across 91.25 days. 91.25×38.25 Million= 3,490,312,500. 3÷3,490,312,500= 8.59521891E−10 

If anyone more proficient in math can translate that proposterous nonesense into an actual number, that would be great. I just used the calculator on my phone, which is a samsung S20+."
2,This is like the bacteria’s boogeyman
1,The cartoonish of look these videos do not at all match the terror I feel watching them.
0,As an avid swimmer and lover of everything water. The Brain eating amoeba is my WORST FEAR fearful_face
1,Can we just take a moment to appreciate the music?
1,"A beach in Iowa has this, and I got a news pop-up on my phone that someone got infected with Naegleria fowleri, and immediately had to come back here. Spooky"
1,The animation has once again reached a new.level and it looks simply fantastic! Great job!
1,Here's an idea: Why not put the positive ending before the information to ease people's minds? This is just some clickbaity horror show. You can do better! Thumbs down for this one.
1,"I couldnt believe my eyes and ears when I saw your voice as a character, astonishing! This video is definitely at the top with wonderful editing and creativity, exciting and wholesome at the same time. I LOVE IT!"
2,"Wow changed thumbnail in 
5 hour"
1,"I was sitting here watching being like like sure I could get rid of it with medicine, until he said 97% fatality rate"
1,If zombies were microscopic beings:
1,Watching this while ii use my neti pot
1,One more vid before bedtime.. oh well...
1,Now It makes Sense As to Why Some People Plug their Nose when jumping into Water
2,Thank you for stealing my dreams tonight
1,I know a girl that caught this in a pool in Florida she is on some med that basically just buys her time but sooner than later the meds will stop working from what she told me it’s really sad cuz she’s super sweet sometimes she talks to ppl who arnt in the room an a bunch of other things you think are crazy if you didn’t know why i should give her a car an see how she’s doing
1,"Amazing video as always. But I have to say whoever came up with the existential dread idea deserves a pat on the back, that was fantastic!"
2,my friend jumb in pool and water enter in ear that is fine
1,One of the immune system cell  looks like an among us character
1,A mutant of this could create  the zombie apocalypse LOL
1,Wow I think that guy at the beginning was the first time you guys animated a human that looks more realistic
1,"Man, someone really needs to make a Kurzgesagt bacteria RTS game... If you ever plan something like this, please hire me! :D"
1,"Kurzgesagt: This humble amoeba is totally overhyped.
Also Kurzgesagt: "
1,"I don't know if I heard Xisumavoid, or it's just .. ugh. 
"
1,I am never swimming again
2,The animation is even better than before
1,"me, who just used a netti pot without properly sterilizing it: *panik*"
2,This is one of the best examples of ”ignorance is bliss”
1,"I hope you make a video about microplastics in commonly used things like teabags, makeup, glitter, chewing gum, wet wipes, aluminium cans, etc. 
Your videos have awesome persuading power! my little brother saw the video on plastic pollution and tries to come up with solutions to reduce it. Correlations have been found between microplastics and health problems and I'd love to see you address this issue.
By the way, loved the existential dread part at the end!"
1,Oh no no I don’t want them pleading_face
1,I live the animation
1,"Well, they finally accepted the fact their videos cause existential dread"
1,I loved that end bit with the plot twist being that the narrator was a also bird the whole time
1,Who need horror movies when we already have Kurz... never mind. :)))
1,Never swimming again :D
1,"this one was way too random and fear inducing imo
never heard about it and now im worried
goddamn basilisk"
2,"Welp that's another thing to be scared of, great ."
1,"right so no more swimming in the lake
what abour rain?"
1,The birbs are unavailable as the have already suffered this fate.
1,Did you know that the biggest epidemy was in Czechoslovakia? (16 people died...)
1,you had us in the first half
2,"the only good thing ""god"" did lol"
1,"ignorance is bliss, kurzegesagt takes this phrase to a wholenother level"
1,science is scarier than any horror movie and you can't prove me wrong.
1,You got me on the first half I'm not gonna lie
1,What the f***. Why would you make this video
1,I was just so horrified while listening to this
1,We need an amoeba vaccine
2,I am that 3% that didn't die and I'm lucky for that
1,Welp I’m buying swimming goggles that cover my nose
1,"I remember the time a few years ago when a 14 year old boy got a huge headache and actually died
It was very sad
Obviously I found out years later and I'm not even American but when I did I was horrified about them"
1,Not only was this video awesome but the ending was amazing XD
1,exactly
1,"The ending marketing with ""dread"" was the absolute greatest thing I have ever seen"
1,I miss the time 10 minutes ago when I didn´t now about Mr. Braineater here.
2,There's some neat new animation here! Love to see the innovation!
1,The animation is amazing  the music and the very smooth narration a very well made video
1,"""More fluid enters the brain"" _ad_"
1,"The way that the embodiment of dread was defeated was something straight out of an anime with a target demographic of 6-11, and I love the corniness"

1,"As a Floridian, I can confirm that we keep these things as pets along with our local alligators."
2,loved the spookwave music XD.(also: existential dread plushieeahhhh woudl be cuteee!)
0,I love how the ending has been tailored to soothe people from entering into depression from existential threat.
1,The sounds of the fluids etc are really well done
2,Why they are treating us like children ! Hhh that's amazing
1,"Can we please keep the words ""Brain"" and ""Parasite"" as far from each other as humanly possible?"
1,I got one but it starved
1,When for sum reason the ameba is able to resist the inmune systam
1,"I think these videos are good for mental health. I experience a lot of anxiety, the joke about existential dread is way too real. I don't know why, but the way this horrible knowledge is presented in an amusing manner helps in some small way. I doubt this comment will be noticed, but nonetheless, thank you, Kurzgesagt."
0,"Oh damn, this was scary"
2,Great animation and knowledge in a same time love from Indonesia beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes
2,The graphic is f*ing greater.
1,this video's thumbnail alone gave me dread
1,From now on i dont want to swiming anymore
2,"At first I was suddenly afraid of water more than ever before, but that little cute promo saved me, haha. THANKS EXISTENTIAL DREAD for your OUTSTANDING performance ! haha"
1,I literally started shivering uncontrollably from this video. Turns out the most effective horror for me is stuff that's real explained like a school lecture.
1,"Kurzgesagt will make you fear and tremble first before actually telling you that it is nothing to be worried about face_with_tears_of_joy but seriously tho, that's still scary to think about"
1,oh boy! this is nightmare stuff
0,Covid: boring.  Get on my level.  I can kill s boddy if I wanted to
1,That last part... That is the BEST AD OF ALL TIME
1,This amoeba has a scary resemblance to the alien in Carrion
1,"As someone who had a vacation to the beach a week ago, the dread is pretty spot on! Lol"
0,"Thanks, I needed this fear in my life"
1,Boi was so worried he had to stop time for himself. 
1,"182,577 person to watch"
1,Do you know how Brain Eating
1,"Amoeba overcome our immune system so effectively. This is the reason amoeba live in hostile environment alone, but our weak immune cell need cooperation of other body cells to live in this hostile world."
2,"Well thank you for that, looking forward to my swim, yaay! :D"
2,this 3d effect looks so good
1,"Wasn't this named ""the most overrated danger"" or something a few hours ago?"
1,"This episode was quite unsettling ... Then it got better, and then it went back to 100% when the VA started to display emotions... Like that was so uncharacteristic xd"
1,"Kurzgesagt: giving you existential dread, to sell you a solution.

Jk, love this channel!  I always learn something new."
1,This title is very misleading... I came away from this video MORE afraid of this even though I previously knew it's incredibly rare.. there's a lake I swim in every summer...
1,"Little bit of uncanny valley with the human animations, still a great video tho"
1,There are no more brain cells but you're still alive that means you don't know anything but i know 2 + 2 because the answer is 5
1,This is such stuff as horror movies are made on...
1,Doesn’t a fever also increase how effective your immune system is though?
1,"a zombie named Naegleria fowleri eats brains, I forgot to mention it's an Amoeba."
1,That has probably been one of the most horrifying videos I've watched in a while.
0,Oh this explains why my brothers are so dumb
1,"I have psychosomatic hypochondria, and when I first googled this disease like 2 years ago I had psychosomatic migraines for 7 days straight and then had a psychosomatic seizure.
Psychosomatic basically meaning symptoms that feel and appear incredibly real, but are entirely produced by anxiety.
The symptoms aren’t hallucinations, but instead your body freaking out over something it thinks it has but really doesn’t."
1,Well most of us don't have enough brain for the amoeba to feed on so we're safe face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy
0,"fucking hell dude, so the worse we get the stronger they get, what utter bullshit, that's too OP, not fair at all, god needs to nerf this bs"
2,"I love these videos
I how you started using 3D way more often you content is better than ever"
1,"I’m sure someone has already said this, but it is micro-glia, not my-crog-lia. Computerized speech synthesis programs are horrible at pronouncing medical words."
2,Kind of a pointless video.
1," IDK why this has me laughing way more than it should. Something about the sudden ""I'm in danger."" is funny to me for some reason"
1,"If I had a nickel for every time Kurzgesagt started a video with “a war has been going on for billions of years, I’d have 2 nickels. which isn’t a lot, but its weird that it happened twice."
1,The level of the grpahics and animations is mesmerizing. Trully amazing work.
2,Thanks now I don't want to have a shower
2,Your the best YouTube channel I bought something from your shop your the best
1,I have friends which this amoeba cant eat their brains because they dont have
1,Dear sweet jesus that is horrifying. Never getting wet ever again.... Just in case!
1,And here i am already afraid of swimming you just increased it by 500× so uh Thanks!
1,Im never touching water again
2,I'm so glad these videos are freesmiling_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,"The animations this time was killer, way more awesome. It is good to see the there's more improvement to the already amazing animation style."
1,its me mario
1,Lol on my way home I referenced one of your videos to my partner and now I open the app and it's suggesting your video
2,"Thanks for throwing things on my phobia pile, Kurtz! (great episode as always)"
1,My family plans to go for a swim. I think we should cancel the plan after watching this video. loudly_crying_face
1,I absolutely adore the animation of this video. I can't really point out exactly the difference between this and older ones but something about it makes it so much better and more pleasant to look at.
1,And with climate change on the rise I'm assuming it will only get worse
1,note to self: plug your nose when ever i get in a pool or water
1,"Can we fight Naegleria Fowleri itself, if it doesn't cause symptoms?"
1,"This video is amazing quality again
I don't know why certain previous videos were lower quality using reused scenes"
2,The animation was astounding wow
1,"World, save this channel. I want my kids to grow up watching this masterpiece cartoons."
2,"Great video! Some of your best animations of humans in the meat-world.
You should do one about prion diseases!!"
1,"Oh Frick my family will go to splash island with large pools and slides and some famous waves........
I'm in danger!!!!"
1,I was in the 5th immune system battalion when we were dispatched to fight the amoeba that ate the brain. Many brave soldiers were lost but as the lieutenant of the calvalry we were able to flank then enemy and completely demolish them. With our artillery bombarding them it was able to kill them pretty easily. Many soldiers were lost but their sacrifices were not in vein
1,Is this parasite also in bath watah?
1,I feel like this is one time when the cute animated birds won't save us.
1,"Not sure how common is this kind of Amiba, but human ancestors sure do their life around river and lake and drink away most of time."

You fricking die"
1,is it the first time they have animated humans in such a realistic manner?
1,Virus will find its way
1,"dude this virus is literally a champ, he can actually fight and can dominate our immune system, how!!"
1,The animations in this video are on a WHOLE new level. Absolutely love them
1,"Interesting, I saw an A/B test on the title of this video:

A: The Most Overhyped Monster on Earth
B: The Most Horrible Parasite: Brain Eating Amoeba"
2,Nice improved animation. N I love the music. Wonder if I can find this kind of music somewhere.
2,These videos come out like company quarterly reports lol....do you guys hand draw them?
1,"Now I want a RTS game based on bacteria, virus and the imune system."
1,"If it thrives in the heat, maybe hypothermia could kill it?"
2,Playing Carrion be like
1,Does it exist in the beach ?
1,Title the most horrible brain eating parasite other video your immune to every disease
1,ill never swim bcs of this
1,"When I saw the thumbnail, I immediately thought of that one amoeba in dirty waters

Didn’t realize how terrifyingly good this thing was against our immune system tho"
1,I wasnt that much of a swimmer anyway
1,if this narrarator changes i will literally cry
1,Those were in my town on the beach a few years back
2,god had a shit eating grin on his face when he made this thing
1,"I watch these videos a lot and and there is one that makes me know that this almost never happens to death is that we have the most deadliest thing on plant earth the bacteriaogh  (I don't think I spelled it right) on our side this is the videos name,    the most deadliest thing on earth the bacteriaogh it's from I can't type the name of this video series and if you did already watched it but still the bacteriaogh acts like A HUMAN BEING ULTIMATE WEAPON THAT NOTHING CAN STOP it's like if co-vid19 betrayed itself as a virus and became a man weapon I think the bacteriaogh IS 1000 times more stornger then that And you can sign up to get the bacteriaogh enjectet inside your body like a vaccine (and doing that has almost saved over 1,000,000 people) and tell me it is like if every vaccine in the world was all in one that is what it would be like getting it enjectet inside of you"
1,"This was an unusual bad video for Kurzgesagt. I used to support you guys cause you are so genuine, motivate and encourage learning. Yet in this video you seem to betray all those principles i thought you hold in high regard. (I’m referring to the content that relies on fear to get attention. Other than that it is unnecessary information. and the blatant commercial at the end) thumbs_downthumbs_down"
1,Well there's one more reason not to go into my apartment's local pool.
1,I wonder how many of these I eat every time I get a drink from a creek or pond.
1,Oh come on... I haven't even seen your video yet and this video has already ruined my day. I know exactly what this video is about (naegleria fowleri) and it scared the shit outta me for a considerable amount of time a couple years back. Honestly I'd love to see more videos about space stuff (maybe something on the local group or massive stars or exoplanets) or some other stuff on immunity in general but in my opinion this is just a bit too gruesome.
0,Now all the goddamn cells look like fucking among us

1,GREENLAND HERE I F@CKING COME!
1,Ah yes my monthly overdose of anxiety
1,"Consider where your soul
will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell
because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to
him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with
lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous
God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is
loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is
God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the
penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we
break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect
thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all
humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess
Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the
perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death
to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal
life is promised to those who have faith.                 ,./,./                  /.,/.,/.                    /.,/.,/.,/.,/. ,/.,/.,/.,/."
0,"Wrap your mind around that though... 236,000 people died from drowning in 2019, before the pandemic! That's just nuts! And sad. :("
1,"Nah, unsubbed from this fear mongering channel. Used to be informative, but now it's just trying to get clicks by ruining people's day."
1,"And the worst of all is that because it is a neglected disease in practically all countries, it would only become the target of research for possible cures and vaccines with a large number of deaths worldwide. And another aggravating factor is that, as this amoeba is already adapted to the human immune system, probably the only way to fight it would be with intense gene therapy in people already infected, or by creating embryos in the laboratory that are already resistant to this microorganism. In either case, it would be expensive, no doubt unethical, and very distressing."
1,"Ok hear me out
How about we develop more in controlable nanotechnology that can attack cancer cells or even amoebas

Like its pretty effective as far as i can see"
1,we finally know what the narrator's bird looks like
1,"I was loving the video. But when I saw the animation of that face and those moth wings, I really fell in love with the video.  That end was so adorable.  it was so funny to imagine the narrator voice on that tiny round bird. Exellent video again."
2,Nice. Next up: The Candiru!
0,"Existential dread needs to be a common feature in your videos, like what Shadow is to the Sonic the Hedgehog series. The bad guy that's evil sure, but ultimately useless."

This channel still gets me everytime!"
2,Why was this entertaining as much as it was educative lol
1,"hmmmm, nice time to post this, May, soon June, summer, water etc.... thx :("
1,Good news captain! The momentary lapse in oxygen extinguished the fire on the bridge.

1,The most metal of wars and we dont even see it
1,The whole team working to make everyone watching it be scared out of their life
1,I think this is the first time we saw kurzgesagt
1,Y’all need to make a tv show or something!
1,ahh so thats why Im the way I am
0,The embodiment of dread makes me glad i got the spinny pin of fears.
1,"I'm not too sure if I should put this here or if Kurzgesagt will see this but i think it would be fun if Kurzgesagt could try to explain what the Green Flu from Left 4 Dead 2  would look like and what it would do to your cells. basically a close look at the Green Flu also, I'm guessing somebody who worked on Churchill or happy I think it was called  might have  animated that existential dread cloud it looks very similar to the artstyle and how its animated"
2,i love the way kurzgesagt draws the animation i even bought merchendise it super nice
1,"This is why you're supposed to boil the water (And let it cool!) before using a neti pot, assuming yours doesn't have a filter. It is literally designed to push water up through your sinuses and out the other nostril, so if you're unlucky, you're going to have quite a time."
1,That background music slapped thosparkling_heart
1,Kurzgesagt is literally why I decided to role myself as the immune system
1,"""A really bad idea in the brain"" grinning_squinting_face"
1,"Yet another amazing video, keep up the great work."
1,I suddenly dont really want to swimgrinning_face_with_sweat
1,I didn’t need to know this existed
1,"I don't know about ameoeaeaebeaes, but as someone that lived through the time mad cow disease made headlines, prions truly terrified me as a kid."
1,Could the most horrible parasite be people like Kurzgesagt who are weighing the internet down? Inquiring minds want to know...
2,I'm loving those 3D elements of the video!
2,can it also be in the oceans or seas?? but like i love your videos
2,because he loves all his children...
0,They took out my boi existential dread!!!!!
1,bacterio vs brain eater who will win?
1,Could the Bacteriophage deal with the Naegleria Fowleri?
2,Great video! I love how the humans are animated
0,New fear uloked
1,"Thanks, Mister Duck Man! I don't want to breath the warm water droplets in the air anymore."
1,At times I've wondered if our immune system has evolved an 'off switch' to terminate an individual when they're in such sad shape they may be a threat to the community.
1,"Welp, guess I need nose plugs now..."
1,How fitting time to trigger my anxiety and Kurzgesagt actually addressed that
1,I’m feeling unsafe right now my fore head feels a little hot and I feel it hurting a little
1,"I was practicing flips off a dock diving board yesterday (August) in Washington state and received a healthy dose of warm-ish lake water up my nose. Been scouring the internet for information on this pathogen and I don’t like what I’m finding. If I don’t reply within 2 weeks, well, you know."
0,this scared me more than a real horror movie.
1,Just watched the episods of X-Files were they make a reference of this amoeba. Amazing!
2,This.. is not fine.
2,the existential dread animation was extremely hilarious! loved it!
1,And here im thinking i can kill people's with that amoeba like corona virus pensive_faceexpressionless_face
1,"Man, that 3D animation of the moths *chef's kiss*. Looks like Kurzgesagt is stepping up their animation game."

1,Please switch back to the black birdie
1,Can we all take a moment to appreciate the amazing original background music fir this video
1,"Me the next time I get a common sickness ""IS THIS THE END"""
1,Pretty sure that’s just called “TikTok.”
1,"Watching that in my bath, I don't feel threaten at all"
1,The brain eating amoeba has got to be in my top three amoeba.
1,"Stephenson's Rocket was an early steam locomotive built by English engineer Robert Stephenson in 1829. It was not the first steam locomotive, but it was among the most influential. It was built for the Rainhill Trials, a competition between various locomotive designs and was clearly the winner. Stephenson's Rocket was the first locomotive to be laid out in roughly what would become the standard layout for steam locomotives and was the first steam locomotive to achieve a speed of 48kph."
2,No thank you.
1,"even if somebody does get the amoeba, cant we just send a few thousand phages. Since Kurzgesagt themselves said that phages evolve, are they going to be able to attack  and kill the amoeba? Ever since i have seen the bacterio phages video, I've believed that phages were the strongest bacteria. So maybe we do have a cure to them?"
1,"My best buddy, Tyke was killed by this or something similar a few months ago.
He was such a good dog. I miss him terribly.
F**k nature!"
1,"I asked my zoology teacher about this amoeba and he says the chance of getting this parasite in dry environment is extremely low, meanwhile in the water that lacks chlorine, ozone and salt the chance of contracting it is relatively high."
1,Why do I feel like this is their most terrifying video I've watched.
1,"in my country many years ago,there was a man slowly died because of this amoebas,they ate his brain and his personality changed.Many years later,i avoid and never swim in the lake or water fall in the wild.While other foreigners are clueless and just enjoy swimming."
1,"I just plug my nose lol
never could stand water going up my nose even a little"
1,"I'm from India, and I read about a teen boy from Kerala who died from primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) caused by Naegleria fowleri, after he bathed in a stream near his home on a hot summer day, the temperature these amoebas thrive in. I believe they're not true amoebas rather shape-shifting amoeboflagellates (Excavates)."
1, This is an historical day. This is the first time Kurzgesagt made one of its animated protagonist speak :o
1,most of the cells looks like among us
2,The animation just keeps getting better and better with each new video!
2,I love the music in these videos
1,“I can’t persist in the presence of awe” is one of the deepest comments I’ve ever heard about existential dread.
2,the outro is absolutely perfect
1,Uhh… I’m totally not terrifyingsad_but_relieved_face
1,"One of the classes that I took in university was zoology. We learned a lot in it. There were some lectures about parasites. The teacher was someone who was an expert in this field. I learned a lot in that course. 
My advice would be:

1. Never bathe in unknown waters, especially hot waters. This brain eating parasite isn't the only parasite you can get while bathing in such water. There is a reason why I prefer bathing in my own bathtub. 

2. Always cook your food correctly, and don't eat anything raw, including sushi. I personally don't eat sushi, and I cook my meat very well. Parasites in fish are more common than one thinks. Sushi is often treated, depending on the place, but it isn't a guarantee. When you cook the meat, the parasites are more likely to die.

3. Wear a full body cover when in the wild. Have good shoes too. Also, cover your head. A hat is crucial, because it will stop botflies to put eggs into you. Botflies prefer to add their eggs into animals, but some specific species can add them to humans. By having a hat, you can prevent them to add eggs into your head. 

4. Never eat snails. Snails are the secondary host to multiple parasites found in fish. It's part of the circle. They stay in snails before they travel to fish. 

I have more, but these will do for now, because they are the most important one."
1,Believe it or not the brain eating ameoba does not like to eat your brain it perfers what's in thr water
1,"this video undersells just how life endingly painful having your nerve cells being eaten alive is


edit: this happened to my eyes, acanthamoeba instead tho"
1,The only thing that might prevent it is if you prevent water from getting in your nose in the first place.
1,The last part of the video actually serves as a theraphy for me. Thanks
1,I thought this was going to be about Nessie
1,thanks i have a new nightmare know...
2,That ad at the end was so cringy lmao
1,Why would you teach me this
2,My god the music
1,Good thing i cant swim
1,...0_0  I suddenly feel really glad I haven't gone swimming in an outdoor pool in years.  Because this is *horrifying.*
1,Tip: remove the water from your nose as fast as possible
1,The bare fact that I have a big brain: (chuckles) I’m in danger.
1,"That ending with the extensional dread guy, made my day. I may get a poster now"
1,I had a brain eating amoeba he died from hungry :(
2,That was a cheery one.  Thanks
1,I only have one braincell and it is well hidden so I don't see any problem here
1,"as long as pools have chlorine, ur completely safe, according to research, chlorine kills these parasites in a matter of 9 minutes."
1,"Yes this is all well and good.  Quick question tho, how would I approach never being remotely near water again?"
1,"Great, now I'm afraid of pools, among many other things."
1,"Speedrun get naegleria Fowleri at any% death 
(Lol)
Don’t try really speed running getting naegleria fowleri"
1,"NOT GONNA LIE, they had us in first half."
1,Ah now I know why I have no brain cells
2,Damn the animation keeps getting better and better
2,I liked this video before i even watched it. Thid is the best channel ever.
1,Now I can't sleep
1,Explains a lot in my head. All the voices...
1, built different
1,It'd be cool to know how many times I've had and beaten it before it got to my precious yolk.
2,That ending has a better story than WoW
1,Amoeba enter my brain ME : then enjoy starving
1,I will now never enter a pool without nose plugs.
2,"Love the narrator duck, so cute"
1,"K thanks, this was genuinely horrific. I haven’t felt chills like this in years and I love horror films. It’s probably cause it can cause death in a week, there’s no treatment for it, and could be literally anywhere…













Great vid"
1,yoo the poster of the evolution of animals that the dread showed is my brothers poster and mine is the world map poster
1,The posters are a wee bit expensive OK_hand
1,is that a carrion reference in the thumbnail i see?
1,So not the movie version of a zombie virus?
1,"Thanks for spiking up my anxiety again. It coincided when I accidentally inhaled some warm swimming pool water as I was learning how to swim, to overcome my irrational fear of pools and seas. Now I cant stop overthinking about it knowing it might happen to me. I'm from the Philippines btw and I never heard any case of it here but thanks to the video, my anxiety has been crippling once again and I hate it"
1,So If I don't have any braincells then the brain eater wont attack me?
2,The best animation about immunity for real. I wish all my textbook or learning materials are like this so I dont hate school
2,the storytelling of this video was so good. loved it!!
1,I would recommend that the next video talk about schizophrenia or some other mental disorder but I don't know if it would be interesting
1,Can you do an episode on the Mars rover? :D
1,Just another nature made horror beyond my comprehension
1,"I'm terrified of water now. 
My understanding is, plug your nose, you'll be fine lol."
1,"There's a few microorganisms that massively change behaviours and/or physiology to take advantage of  specific situation and multiply a bunch but are at least sorta normal outside of it. Some of the biological groups we call slime moulds only go into 'goop mode' when conditions are perfect, some plankton turn carnivorous if there's high water temp and low nutrients, and some usually benign gut bacteria can also cause illness.
I wonder if that amoebas pattern of behaviour applies to some other (slightly less) rare situation, whether its a form of non-human parasitism or maybe doing something in low-oxygen environments."
1,Thank youuu for turkish cc
1,I really love Steve Taylor's birdsona.
1,Today's animation was a little different
1,What a great video to release when it's very close to summer! grinning_facethumbs_up
1,I came here after dr house episode when foreman got infected by this stuff
1,Ok so am i the only one thinkin this like we came from cells and our cells evolved into more and more over a long time but what if one of these bad cells end up evolving into a monstrous creature
1,Why is there not a class based team shooter where it's the immune system VS invaders
1,This is insane
1,Reminds me of the Borg from Star Trek TNG
1,"Therapist: ""Existential dread kurzgesagt doesn't exist it can't hurt you""

1,I had to watch the video twice cuz I couldn't pay attention the first time because of how breathtaking the animation was
1,The last scene was epic OK_hand
1,This thing exists in a hot springs near Vegas. People were swimming around in the water without a clue.
1,"Ah, just in time for summer"
2,Well Im swiming with a nose clamp lol. Neat stuff.
1,"Amoeba thrives in heat
Me: bring in the ice water"
1,This amoeba specie needs to be extinct for the good of humanity.
1,"Solution: make them bigger so they are a predator instead of a parasite. Look, having your whole body eaten by an Amoeba sucks but it's not as bad as this."
0,"This amoeba was the cause of death for the last death in the show “1000 Ways to Die”, fun fact."
1,10/10 on the promotional part
0,Damn thats scaryfrowning_face_with_open_mouth
1,"Wait is no one going to talk about that killer ad at the end , and how they commented on their comments..... no , ok."
1,This was not good bedtime viewing. I will never swim in the outdoors again. person_swimmingloudly_crying_face
1,the level of animation here was something on a next level
1,Question: are these amoeba present in Kirkland purified water?
1,Good thing I won't get it that amoeba cause my protector cells are BUFF as a trex the amoeba is like a dang compy
1,i love zuszgesagt's videos about diseases so much!
1,i love this channel i learn something new every video
1,Wait did this video have a different title before? Something like worlds most over rated monster? Idk my memory has been very wack lately and this is putting me off
1,"Fun fact, this video was released prior to the English version on the German Kurzgesagt channel."
0,Didn’t know the fear feaster got a new gig as existential dread lol
0,Who lacks brain cells here
1,it’s almost surreal hearing Steve Taylor speak when he’s not a disembodied voice
1,"Can you make a video about how the ash from fires and coal plants affects the planet. I read about that it’s good for the plants, and does the affect change in different ways depending on where the coal is burning? Like in a forest vs in a city."
0,the entire existential dread part was pretty bad
1,"Them: Talking about a horrible deadly parasite that destroys your brain
The music: woman_dancingman_dancingwoman_dancingman_dancingmusical_notesmusical_notemusical_notesmusical_notemusical_notes"
1,"I dislike this video because I feel it should have started with the fact that this isn't a huge worry. I feel this could easy be misinforming many people who (like I almost did out of fear) click off the video before the end.

Starting a video like this with ""This is uncommon but quite dangerous. So we're going to talk about it"" would have made this a much better video."
0,so..does clo in the pool will kill it??
1,"am i the only one IN LOVE with the new music and human style? i’ve already been in love with the kurzkesagt style but this just takes it to a new level, it’s so engaging and exciting"
1,Since it thrives in hot water if you take a ice bath will it weaken it?
2,"Well, with that and airconditioning being a thing, I now have every reason to not leave my house. Great!"
1,I just found this video and I watched the entire thing at night. I'm never doing a fucking drink water ever again I'm not gonna breathe the same air molecules as it. Don't know if I said that right. Just kidding.
2,I like the sound effectsslightly_smiling_face
1,I have a new excuse to not go swimming in the lake near my house
0,Damn this is Lovecraftian
1,Take a moment to appreciate the spikes in animation quality
1,*New nightmare unlocked...
1,"Only one thing: white cells
One type of T cell is called a cytotoxic T cell because it kills cells that are infected with viruses with toxic mediators. Cytotoxic T cells have specialised proteins on their surface that help them to recognise virally-infected cells.1"
1,bought two posters back in mid 2021. love what you guys do
1,"My parents are going swimming in a lake like a week from now, I'm gonna show them this video."
1,My cousin has that but has thankfully survived for like 3 moths after she got it and she’s still alive now but she can’t talk and it hard for her to understand what we’re saying
1,"Reminds me of how scary rabies is; by the time you feel symptoms of it, it's already too late"
1,"I went swimming in a lake (good thing it was cold) one time and in a pool 2 times so now i question and is now anxiety-filled cause i just saw this video but since i got a little information about it i think it will just make me a little more faithful so yeah thanks for unlocking a new fear for me, Love the vid tho"
2,ok but what about those vitamin  gummies i ate 5 years ago?
1,This parasite is a real-life zombie
1,Im releaved this IS very rare in Finland so im safe

1,Well I’m never going swimming again.
1,*shoves head in freezer*
1,"This is why you don’t snort water, kids

Edit: forgot the comma"
1,"To put it into perspective, these amoebas have killed fewer people in the last century than sinkholes, and by a lot."
1,I feel so grateful after your every video that has immune cells in it. I caught covid a yr back and remember losing taste.... I've partially got back the taste but I'm fascinated by human bodies
1,"Dark cloud: It’s me, your existential dread!
Me: What do you want this time?"
1,dont jump into the pool kids!
2,the animations are getting better
2,Loving the cool backgrounds music Kurz. face_holding_back_tears
1,"Hey I have a question me and my friends went to a pool we were playing volleyball and stuff and sometimes the might take the ball aggressively and make me go underwater which I don't have a problem but one time I think may a bit of water entered my nose but idk if it was enough for the disease and then I think in the range of 9 (I'm not really sure) days I
got a head a 
Slightly bad  headache for 2 two days I'd that bad....?grinning_face_with_sweat"
1,at least it doesn't survive in sea water...
1," - ""Every year, some unlucky people have to deal with it""

You mean die from it. ""deal with it"" is a silly understatement after spending 5 months animating how it kills you with 97% certainty."
1,I’m never taking a shower again;)
1,Imma need to get myself one of these
0,I'm scared already
1,Did anyone else's head start hurting while watching this? Lol
1,"I know people will hate me for this but I gotta say it because I really love this channel. I don't really like the background music in this video, it is all over the place that I am having a hard time focusing and not being irritated. I really love you guys and I will always support your awesome work :D"
2,"The animations are amazing, and getting better and better with each video! Keep up with your great work 
And have a nice day hehe"

2,My friend from my class is ill meningitis. Good luck to him
1,"Yup, should not have watched this one... that's regret to a ""T"""
1,When you put it like that. I got no choice but to buy some of your products. Loved this horror movie with a silver line.
1,Yo my mind can’t process this
1,Why does the monkey in the beginning always holds something different. This time it's flippers.
1,"I went on a run after a few days of flash flooding in my area. I was running by a stream and saw massive mud piles everywhere and some residual wet spots on the trail. I carefully navigated the puddles and mud but hit a slick spot and fell to the ground hard. I skid my knee up something fierce and had mud and river water all over my wound.  I ended up washing off my cut in the stream. It wasn't until I got home that I remembered that there was a death due to a brain eating amoeba at a lake withing 50 miles of me. I panicked for weeks that I was going to die. That was about 4 or 5 months ago. I'm not dead yet, but we will see...."
1,Why the reupload?
1,*! New anxiety unlocked*
1,I swear I'm going to buy a lot of your merchandise when I work and have money :')
1,Bruh has nobody here seen House? Those two episodes about the dirty cop and Foreman getting Naegleria is some of the best ever.
1,"Thanks, now i have to worry about a parasite that might be eating my brain cells while writing this"
1,"Huh so I’ve learned something, when you get rid of existential dread you become a crack duck"
1,"Is this video made just to sell the poster? Seems designed to make people irrationally fearful of lakes. Why not tell people about rabies, at least that would be a good public service announcement."
1,The Flare
1,"""unsuspecting victin""
That boy looks terrified already and he doesn't even know about the bacteria trying to eat his brain"
1,The narrator has been a bird this WHOLE TIME?!
1,I'm rewatching this just for the soundtrack. Props to whoever is behind that.
1,Do rabies next.  A virus that infects the brain causing a change in complex mammalian behavior to spread it via saliva.
1,"scratch that , the only monsters are those that we are unable tosee but are always within us."
1,"Thank you, I've already hated this brain eating amoeba found in rivers sometimes going straight into your brain- but this makes it even worse."
1,YAY! My existential dread is not a character! And more anxiety to never go and bath in an open lake anymore for the rest of my life.
1,this is why you’ll never catch me in a public swimming area
1,remind me why i clicked on this video
2,Press F to pay respect!!!
0,Wtf should I be scared of water now?!
1,"I love how you are telling us about the simplifications you are making. It makes learning about the process much more interesting, and even makes me want to continue the research after the video so I can understand it better. Thank you guys for trying so hard to improve, it shows."
1,"I just finished reading immune, this is crazy!"

1,The animation on this video is very good though
1,Immune system going nuts because they couldn't defeat the infection.
1,Happy to be german and getting this video some days earlier grinning_face_with_sweat
1,Just reading the title makes me think of the maze runner.
1,The production value has gotten fuckin insane over the lifespan of this channel. Its been amazing to watch all these years
1,Just a question can talk to the u cells
1,These guys are just legendary
1,"""Every year some unlucky people have to deal with it...."" most underrated comment involving an albeit rare but terrifyingly deadly disease.....I think the hype is pretty appropriate.... I remember years ago I watched a show about a medical case involving a girl in the US who died from this and what her parents and doctors described what she went through is pretty terrifying. She described hearing evil voices and hallucinations before she died, succumbing to the seizures and coma and turing into a vegetable.... I'd rather be run over by a car again..."
1,"I liked the animation, especially the swimming ameba and existential dread, though not the infected guy"
1,Now do Prions next.
1,381 people since 90 years bruh
1,I’ll now wear a hazmat suit whenever I go swimming. Id much rather get burned to death then die for like six months knowing I can’t be saved. As they say; “6 minutes is better then six months”
1,My body is unique well i have a hole in my head a bit resistantance of cold (the temperature) and i have a loud voice
2,"Great, another thing to be afraid of. Thanks!"
1,Thought it was gonna be about Donald Trump with that title!!
1,The animation and art style has become very impressive. Goo job
1,Well i guess i wont be swimming anymore
1,"Huh, that's strange, I wonder how they manage to get past the blood-brain barrier. Them and prions... heck prions can make it though the stomach, intestinal walls and blood brain barrier without any of those walls, which usually are outright impassible to most unwelcome guests but also nothing of that size range yet they seem to just ""walk"" past like it doesn't even exist. Anytime you have a full grasp on the limits of any form of science, you can be pretty sure there is an anomaly that completely erases that notion... I honestly love that part about science but I'm betting plenty just see it as a headache"
1,This has gave me the most traumatizing memory I have ever witnessed in my life
2,"Ok does anyone just replay this over and over just because there so AWESOME AND FUN!,"
1,"There are new treatments that include medical comas, followed by lowering temperature of the brain and certain antibiotics. Lots of work being done in Florida."
1,Is it real?
1,"The quality of the animations, the new points of view and depth of fields and gorgeous designs improve in each video. This one in particular feels like a big step forward!. Congratulations! you keep raising the bar!"
1,I learned abt this amoeba through that one game that had the amoeba as a hot anime boy yandere… it’s not even an actual amoeba and there’s only been one case in the US surprisingly
1,oh my god this animation quality got me crying
2,good thing i dont have enough money to go pool fun
1,I will forever be amazed at just how big this Chanel is

1,"...I just swam in the river, am I okay?"
1,"Hey @Kurzgesagt, it would be great to make a video called ""What is science?"" with a list of all scientific fields (human and natural)! It could be a great poster too!"
1,A video on rabies would be interesting.. Although it's brutal
1,Sweet mother of Zeus their  (already stellar) animation just keeps improving and improving!
1,Never swimming again.
1,"Geezzz what the...
At least I mostly swim in ocean water that probably have other stuff, but not that one!"
1,"There is something so fascinating in our immune system. Its like an army thats just inside you, protecting you. And its tactics and ""troops"" are so creative and deadly for something so small. I always love these immune system videos. Hope you create more of them red_heart"
1,"I think existential dread is the only time Steve Taylor had expressed emotion in these videos except for maybe ""Nuke a city"" but that was more urgency than emotion.

I mean when he goes ""Could you not please"" he sounds so sad and he's so happy and amazed when talking about learning!"
2,loved the ending animation
1,For a kid friendly animated educational channel these guys are either very depressing or quite horrifying.
0,thanks another unreasonable  fear unlocked
1,"While we all appreciate your uploads I just wanna point out that the animation was on another level in this video!
Keep doing what you do kurzgesagt!"

1,U should start a Kurzgesgat animation course
1,Kurzgesagt narrator is a bird confirmed?
1,Idk if you'll see this and I'm probably not alone but I'll take a Kurzgesagt Video over any anime and any movie/ tv show any day.
1,So creepy

1,What is the name of the end music
1,the Lovecraftian microverse
1,"My humble request to you is to read and spread knowledge about Vedic scripts. They are said to be older than 7000 years. Vedas are eternal knowledge for well being of  humans and It contains truth of our existence. I suggest you to read vedanta and upanishads as they might be more relevant regarding the content. Thankyou I hope you just dont ignore it instead have a look and then decide if you want to study it or not. Believe me it is eternal truth on why we are, our purpose and our existence."

1,"So… yeah, glad I live really really far from a beach.
Watching these videos since the channel begun, and the evolution is just impressive… the 3D in this video is just spectacular! The 1600hrs/video really do pay off."
2,Kurzgesagt loves all about brain so much
0,You managed to fuck Up my summer...
1,Is it so overhyped that Kurzgesagt haddock to change the title?
2,"Cool,this is amazing,as always."
0,Watching this while sick enhances the dread I'm currently feeling.
1,hearing mr narrator sir not care about the existential dread is really funny
1,Bro... It's intelligence is crore times more then us if compared in ratio...
1,This why I don’t swim in water unless it’s a pool that’s that white people shit sorry swimming with  gators and shit won’t catch a black man   No no  no
0,I’m literally shaking
1,That moth animation is mesmerizing and I am in dire need of studying it.
1,"Thanks for this informative video. Stumbled across this video after watching the recent Youtube news story about the unfortunate 13 year old Florida boy who contracted this brain eating amoeba after swimming in a fresh water lake. Poor kid. ""97 percent"" fatality rate is scary."
1,Mission don’t swim ever agin
1,so what have we learned today? don't go swim!
1,Geniticlly modified immune systems when
1,bruh now we know what the narrator looks like
1,"I actually got paranoid of brain-eating Naegleria fowleri when I was using a neti pot to clear my nose before I got to regularly using a humidifier, but I made sure to boil the water that I used then (after reading through this terrible info on google flushed_face ), wash the neti pot with soap, then put boiling water overflowing on the neti pot, leave it to cool to room temperature or warmer, and put about 1/4 tsp salt mixed in the water to kill the amoebae if there are any.

For good measure, just try not to get the water up your nose when you're swimming as this amoeba, whilst extremely rare, can thrive in any kind of warm waters (especially untreated swimming pools, pipes, fountains, spas, hot springs, lake, beach) and has a fatality rate of 97%"
1,"Talk about ""le vide quantique"" and what's before the big bang pls"
1,"This just reminds me of Prions, which also terrify me."
1,Taking the no braincells meme at a whole new level
1,"The title grabbed me. A book i read in childhood was ""The Brain Eaters"" with the caption 'Inside your head they are digging, feeding, destroying...'"
1,100 comments less than a minute from release
1,"Great video, I wasn't scared of amoeba before watching it, nor am I after. Somewhat enlightening on the subject, however I am still far more afraid of driving and of climate change than any disease or rare body-horror event."
1,this justifies the fact of why you should hold your nose jumping into the water
1,Why did I click this?
1,"Can we just talk about how good music has become in Kurzgesagt videos? I know the animation is incredible but I was really shocked when at , when the amoeba discovered the nerve cells, an intense trap song started blasting with this moment. So cool and fits so good with the animation!"
1,"ok, health anxiety, here we go"
1,That's scary!
1,"This one was, even for Kurzgesagt, on another level graphically"
1,"Existential Dread: I’m here to make you question your own existence and everything you hold dear in life.

1,I don’t think posters will keep me from having existential dread from how many ways I know I can die slowly or in an instant without having a thing I can do…
1,one of the first finally
1,"Sure, watching a video about ""Brain eating amobia"" is a good thing to watch right before bed"
1,Water is scary now
2,I like the new animation
0,Number 1 fear Brain eater
2,"Excellent video, as usual!  The plug for the store was really good too hahs"
1,"When you think about it, your cells and this amoeba isn't aware of themselves but they actually fight wars like a tower defense game.. Pretty surreal."
1,"Turns out we have millions of brain eaters living inside us all this time!!!





But we also have millions of brain eater eaters.

Wait!! But none of them are inside the brain itself!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Oh I see, their at the surface of the blood vessels, which virtually exist throughout the entire brain, plus entropy carries them a little farther out. So we're safe again.

Just my guess on how this video is going to turn out.

After first term seconds ""the has been a war..."" Okay so they cut to the chase. I respect them again. Sorry, just got back from a different hype, dreams click bait video about electricity of all things."
1,MK2 COVID
1,"yep, never swimming again... thanks for that..."
1,Thanks a lot for giving me germophobia and hydrophobia
1,The animation levels up every video... Those moths look edible
2,Jokes on you I don’t have braincells
0,Sucks for you mortals.
1,those cells looking a bit sussy
1,"I think I'm afraid of narrator bird, he has absolutely horrifying sparkling eyes which even makes existential dread run in fear face_screaming_in_fear"
1,"jokes on you, i already have  thallassophobia or however you spell it from subnautica"
1,Life but everytime i watch a vidéo it makes me scared
2,thanks for my newest nightmare!
1,It blows my mind that there’s a noticeable jump in quality for every new video published on this channel. The animation is already top notch and it just keeps clapping_hands getting clapping_hands  better
1,You could have mentioned the infection rates first! You nearly gave me a fear of swimming.
1,"It's so funny to pick a comparsion between this amoeba kill and the ones who drown counts, but, I fear, the ones in medicine, government spheres etc. who would make this problem a mere nightmare of past will think in the same way - as long as counts are not matching, they won't give a damn about researching a treatment or some sort of amoeba-killer agent, be it germ, chemicals or whatsoever.
  And, with all due respect, but for G-d's sake I do not tolerate at any possible form and kind such bravado in ads. Let your educational merch be perfect in all matters, it is cheesy, cringey and just plain deception to advertising it as ""something capable of getting rid ya of your existential dread"". I pretty sure that you do not advertise psychoterapists' customs and of other such folks as ""loyalty bonus"", do you?"
1,The animation is amazing a great step up from the last ones its amazing!
1,"Yall went psycho on the visuals

Very very well done!!"
1,Only in mucky water
1,I never liked swimming anyway
0,I had a Amoeba once poor fella died of Hunger
1,Now lets get brain freeze if the the amoeba thrives in the heat
1,"So here's my amateur theory

Perhaps this amoeba was a parasite one that evolved to hunt one of the other now extinct hominid species

That's just my tiny working hypothesis"
1,i've been in rivers pool ocend (sorry for typo) and im still ok
2,I like some of the new 3D animation!
1,so this amoeba is america and our brains is the middle east and that chemical is oil. i’m not wrong
1,"Thanks Kurzgesagt, i'm not letting water into my nose ever again. Once again, thanks."
0,Most of this channel is just bullshit meant to scare people or make them feel insignificant.
1,Why did I feel happy when I learned that my immune cells had my back when the amoeba was eating my brain up.
0,"Ahh, new fear unlocked"
1,Do you think using a nasal spray afterwards like a saline spray would cut down the risk even more after you swim in a lake or body of water
1,Yo
0,Most of the time the coke I snorted kills this guy.
1,Doesn't this guy sound like the guy from Little Big Planet 3?
1,As a hyperchondriac it's unfortunate I can't unsee this video... Truly horrifying.
1,"For the first time, I’ve heard a different voice on this channel, THIS IS GETTING AWESOME!!!!"
1,"This channel is amazing, but for some reason, I feel like something is wrong... the videos aren't the same anymore... Idk why, but I liked the way they did it when they where smaller... Still amazing tho! :D"
1,Ngl that segment with the amoeba attacking the immune cells was kind of epic. Like watching an actual battle unfold.
2,well thats a bad day to be smart lol
1,Great... now I'm afraid to go swimming...
0,This is a fucking horror movie!!
1,I would like to see this thing try to get through my flintstone vitamins
1,So why not only swim in chlorinated cold pools or the ocean? Problem solved
1,my immune system is soo good that it just swats away thing. like that one time i got dog poop in my mouth somehow
0,Somebody in Iowa died from this over the weekend
1,We have found the plague of twitter!
1,my brain is being eaten worrying about this stuff
2,Thank you for talking about it.
2,Don’t like the new animation but loved the video
1,Oh god what i’ve missted u Kurzgesagt. I almoste thougt this chanel had given up. Just wanna tell i live ur vids
2,I love that existenstial dread part. That was so cute :)
1,Well this isn't that scary whats really scary to me are Prions which have a higher fatality chance than amoeba and so far no survivors.
1,This is why I only go to the beach. I'd rather deal with a shark than with Naegleria fowleri.
0,what is this weird dread blorb?
1,"AAnnnndd now I'm scared of my pool. XD
What temperature do these Amoeba tend to exist and or thrive at?"
0,you know the channels good when the entity actively trying to make you sad cant help but compliment them
1,our body sends everything and others die for our body the most saddest thing i ever heard
1,Creator of the universe:i love you humans but let me create this tiny monster.
2,Alright I guess I’ll swim with one hand
1,Considering how many other parasites you can get while swimming in fresh water. I think it's best to avoid swimming in anything that's not the ocean or a pool filled with chlorinated water.
1,that moth animation was stunningly good
1,You know it's got you when existential dread knows you on a first name basis.
1,"Ocean water went into my nose once and i think because nothing really happened, i think i got lucky"
1,"I remember way back when in MN, USA there were news stories about a particular small lake had this. I think the lake was pretty remote and had more of this because the temp of the water was high."
1,"gotta say, the quality has come a long way since 3 years ago"
1,Welp I'm never going swimming again
1,The narrator has a bird now?
1,That explains why it is tickling inside my head some times
1,"Ah acetylcholine and things that enter your body that shouldn’t. I later learned after watching this video, which I have returned to rewatch, about how an ion called “tetramethylammonium” is a neurotoxin because it mimics acetyl choline. I share because seeing acetylcholine in multiple contexts helped the importance of it click for me. This ion is the simplest quaternary ammonium cation, aka a quat, basically an ion where a nitrogen holds a positive charge and has 4 atoms bonded to it, usually carbon and never hydrogen (with amines and ammonium ions you pick whether to describe it as primary/secondary/tertiary (and in the case of ammonium ions, quaternary) based on the number of non hydrogen atoms bound to it. An ammonium ion is an amine with a charge, you can easily convert an amine to an equivalently named ammonium ion in acidic conditions, and basic conditions reverse the process although you need a really strong base for quaternary ammonium ions since there’s no hydrogen which is easier to pull off than, say, a methyl group. This reaction adds a hydrogen and a positive charge to the nitrogen when going to acidic conditions, and in fact is why ammonia is a base and not an insanely weak acid even though it’s got three hydrogen). Tetramethylammonium mimics acetylcholine because they both have a trimethylammonium group (the name of the former comes from the fact that’s 4 methyl groups on an ammonium, which means it also has three methyl groups on an ammonium - a trimethyl ammonium group!). By triggering the signal but removing control it is no surprise that it would have neurotoxic effects. As far as I can tell it must be a quaternary ammonium and trimethylammonium doesn’t mimic acetylcholine, although I could be wrong, I’d assume that it’s got something to do with the tertiary ammonium being deprotonated to an amine in basic conditions 

I imagine this is at least part of the reason why benzalkonium chloride, the active ingredient in antibacterial soap and bleach free Clorox wipes, has a benzyl group and two methyl groups instead of three methyl groups

Glossary of groups used in this comment:
Methyl: CH3, basically methane but one hydrogen is replaced
Benzyl: C6H5CH2, basically a methyl group but one of the hydrogen is replaced by a phenyl group, meaning you could also call this a phenylmethyl group but no one does that because it’s needlessly long
Phenyl: C6H5, basically benzene but the H is replaced by something else
Alkyl: a chain of carbon. There are 2n+1 hydrogen, n is the number of carbon. For benzalkonium ions the chains are length 8 to 18 and an even number
Acetyl: CH3CO, named for acetic acid which has the formula AcOH (the Acetyl group is abbreviated in the formula 
In all of the groups mentioned hydrogen can be replaced by a something else, I kinda referenced this with the benzyl group being phenylmethyl, can’t help you understand why benzyl is phenyl methane and phenyl is the group based on benzene though. I assume it’s got to do with benzoic acid, which is actually edible although usually it’s as a salt, sodium benzoate for example

I recommend looking up structures for anything you don’t know the structure of in this comment since I can’t post pictures in a YT comment, it’ll help it click better"

1,I am still... in a dream... Brain Eater!!
1,Kurzgesagt made humans instead of birbs I'm upset downcast_face_with_sweat
1,Good reason to not learn swimming.
1,Maybe it's what happened with your brain ( if you ever had one)! Stop scaring people your s.o.b!
1,"Looking at your videos I thought about a game. Like a mixture of Spore Maneater and Plague INC where you need to survive in the body of a human. You need to eat and try to kill some bacteria, fight against stronger foes until you get notice by the human's defence system. You can level up and increased in size, mutating, gaining new forms and stuff like that. You can unlock new bacteria or viruses to play with, or even worms and stuff from the real world. The human will take medicines until going in a hospital and the game will get harder until you kill the human.
You start little by going under the radar and farming/attacking other viruses or bacteria and then need to face off and win against the immune system.
Sorry for my english btw.
Sadly I'm not near a programmer but I would love to see a game like this. If you know ""Spore"" ""Maneater"" and ""Plague INC"" you exactly know where I am going with this idea."

1,I am so ready for my summer swims
1,This is pure nightmare
1,A hypochondriac should not watch this.
1,everyone i know has this for sure in their brain. Everyone is so stupid
1,This thing has a phase 2
1,@Kurzgesagt can the amoeba infect other animals?
1,Yoooo early
1,"I got this when i was young, from drinking unsafe liquid. Luckily i managed to survive it."
1,"*Kurzgesagt, April 2022:* Don't worry (too much) about climate change.
*Kurzgesagt, May 2022:* Worry about brain-devouring amoeba instead."
1,"In the second season of House MD (SPOILER ALERT) in the episodes Euphoria 1 and 2, Dr Eric Foreman got this exactly thing and almost dies, very brutal and two of the bests episodes of the series"
2,Isn't Nigleria what caused the jackass in Euphoria Pt. 1 and 2 to die?
1,Parisite Brian Monster
1,"This is the reason nobody is allowed in the roman baths in Bath, Uk!"
1,This makes me question the use of nasal douches. I dont use them anyway but surely this would dramatically increase the risk compared to normal. Especially if the user uses warm tap water. We all know that occasionally tap water can become tainted by pipe breaches etc.
1,"I appreciate the complexity of the new animations, however, I very much like the birds instead of humans, they are cuter and the exaggerations in this video are borderline cringe - no offense, the animations are great but I like the older style of videos way better"

1,I didn’t know we were playing terraria calamity
1,Anxiety unlocked aka and or get real 101.
2,Really good animation
1,"Um, I live in an area where this thing is common. It kills people. Not many, but not zero. I won’t swim in untreated water because of them."
2,I don’t want to know this
1,"There is this story of a guy who got sick and when he got tested it was found that he has flesh eating microbes in his body the next day he ""miraculously healed"" from it turns out the test sample got contaminated and he left scot free (with a headache of course).plus after watching this and remembering this story I'm terrified of flesh eating bacteria."
1,I'm mildly horrified that YouTube thought it was a good idea to serve an ad for hot tubs in the middle of this video. Not good marketing.
2,Wow the animation improved so much!
1,Cant wait for the amoeba to control humans and make them eat brains
1,"Oh lord, I won't even shower again face_screaming_in_fear"
1,"Heh, I loved the advertisement at the end, truely amazing with learning, and I guess the best thing to do to avoid getting this disease is try not to jump into the water where water gets up your nose"
1,"Another type of brain hi jacking parasitic protozoans are Toxoplasma gondii,
(I prefer to mispronounce the species name as gon-dee,but it’s pronounced gon-dee-eye),
This parasite is by far the most common human protozoa parasite,
Around a third of the world’s population is infected with this parasite,
This parasite is spread through cat poop(or possibly through a another secret path, through cat carcasses),
and if scavengers such as rats(and mice) eat them, they will then get infected by the T.gondii parasites,
these will try to takeover the rats brain, and give it bravery,
And the parasites command the rats to go towards the cat, and hopefully get eaten by the cat,
Sometimes the infected rat will bite the cat to get its attention,(when it’s targeted host is sleeping),
And if the cat eats the rat,the cat gets infected, and this parasite can only reproduce sexually inside the intestines of the cats,
Which intern allows the parasites to make oocysts,(some oocysts can behave like parasite factories(or bombs)for making more parasites),
And these parasites will infect any warm blooded animal they will come across with(including humans)."
0,I see Kurzgesagt has defeated the existential dread that I get from their videos.
1,"Nobody
Memers: all right people who we have a job to do"
0,The amoeba is like that one annoying chess player who uses your moves against you and attacks so much you can not attack
1,Your animations have become so much better
2,that does not sound very pleasant.
1,This is why I never go swimming anymore
1,Officially the most charming channel on YouTube. Making existential dread look adorable since (at least) 2018! :D
0,yeah you can be scared but there have only been 33 cases of this in 10 years
2,Good vid. Uh-mee-buhz is the better plural form imo. Uh-mee-bee sounds… kind of made up.
1,Ah so this is the amoeba I was told about as a kid. Parents always said don't pee in the water because it would swim up stream so to speak and then go to the brain.
0,Damn I'm genuinely scared now.
1,"Existential dread: I will make you question life! 
Me: Deppresion is darker than you think, also i didn't ask."
1,If funny because before I watched this video I told my brother I was about to take my daily dose of exstensial dread. It's funny  how kurzgesagt has gotten a reputation for giving people exstensial dread and now they are just leaning into it.
1,what if Naegleria would eat a brain cell infected by cancer?
1,"The only Takeaway I have from this video is.




*Always* Pick the ocean as a swimming destination"
1,"Since girussus infect amoeba primarily, would it be a solution to infect the brain with a non-pathogenic girus when diagnosed with neagleria fowleri?"
1,"omg this is so intense, with the music lol heeelp"
1,This animation has entered another dimension.
1,Fowleri is to close to my last name I don’t like it
1,Aight i dont like going into water anyway

2,Thank god I chose corruption
0,Dread could just show the vacuum decay video
1,wait if your immune system has a defense agenst evry possible attacker (stated in imune system vid) how do you die from this  over 90% of the time wouldint your b cells and t cells have activated by then?
1,"My brain is understandably very upset about the prospect of some jerk animal eating it. Like, can you not? Can you just not exist at all? Don't we have enough to be scared of like random black holes speeding through the cosmos, or cells just deciding that they want to live forever and multiply? 
There is enough already nature, stop being a horror movie with a million sequels and franchises into existential crisis' and destruction."
1,Please make a video on the Blockchain
1,I thought Darkiplier made his way to this channel in that ending lol
2,I wish they’d stop giving me a crisis and saying it’ll be okay
1,"This channel is underrated,Incredible!"
1,"now for someone to grab the amobea and study it and its weakness, and tear it apart <3"
0,"so if you have this, you are guaranteed to die?"
2,Well I’m eternally mortified
1,That last bit with the existential dread just made me want a tv series made by Kurzgesagt.
1,we could inject biophages into the skull holding the brain to kill the infection.
1,this is one of my driving germaphobia factors
2,Great now I have another reason to not dive
0,YOOOO! What a hell of an upgrade the animation had! This was really fun to watch.
0,So the immune system is a bunch of tentacle monsters battling in a fight to the death!
1,The most aesthetically pleasing horror movie grinning_face_with_sweatgrinning_face_with_sweatgrinning_face_with_sweat
1,"Everyone's talking about brains getting eaten, but I'm excited that the Narrator is a borb"
1,Tf is your budget now
1,Bro imagine dropping the sickest  beat before telling us we can all die this exact second
1,"Damn, they make this thing sound like solid snake or something; infiltrating an enemy fortress undetected, setting the charges and battling waves of enemy reinforcements. He sounds like a cool guy"
1,"To stay safe just hold your nose when you go under or jump in water I,m sure"
1,I love the new 3D n stuff but at somepoints its kind of scary... And it doesn't feel like Kurzgesagt
2,Good thing I don’t have one as in a brain lol
1,"I want this disease on Cells at work, that'll be epic"
2,"WOAH!! I love uploads like this where there's clear improvement, like WOW the animator really improved since the last upload, mad props!!!"
2,Now I know why my friend has no braincells

1,Its been happening to me from 3 years i do have nausea fatigue sleeping problems and everything else you said what do i do? Even my eyes got thicker crying_face
0,"Well, kurzgesagt you’ve ruined pools for me now too"
1,"Hey Kurzgesagt! 
Can you make a video where you explain how warp bubbles work, and if we potentially can use them for travel in the future? just recently found out about them, and they really interested me. Would be cool to see if it is possible to travel faster than light in the far future."
1,The only most least hyped monster on Earth is Science Deniers
1,I like the head on shot of the bird when he goes “:D”
2,"well, no pool for me this year."

2,Very interesting and awesome. Thank you. smiling_face_with_heartssmiling_face_with_heartssmiling_face_with_heartssmiling_face_with_heart-eyes
1,"Watching this video gave me a genuine panic attack around the seven minute mark. OK_hand

Edit: It probably had little to do with the video, because it's very irrational to be afraid of getting infected and panic attacks are more often caused by underlying psychological factors, but I wanted to comment nonetheless because I found it funny."
1,Anyone else here after that Florida guy died?
1,Dang... Kurzgesagt had really outdid themselves with the animation!
1, WHERE DID THAT INSANE AWESOME ANIMATION COME FROM WHAT
1,Excited
0,New Phobia: *Unlocked*

1,Bruh I was at the edge of my seat watching this what
0,Time to avoid water
1,So does it not infiltrate through ears either?
1,"A boy has been saved in the US neutral_face :

""Doctors at Florida Children's Hospital were able to get quick access to miltefosine, a medication being investigated by the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention that has shown some promise in killing the amoeba. Since the drug may not work quickly enough to stop the damage from the amoeba, the doctors made the decision to put DeLeon in a coma and lower his body temperature to just 33 degrees in order to keep the amoebas still."""
1,Why did you take so much time loudly_crying_face i really missed you man
1,"basically, don't go swimming in weird places. Noted?"

1,Woa
2,THE BEST MEME EVER!!!!!! KEEP IT UP!!
1,Hello ship.
1,why does this remind me of carrion
1,"I see you guys are constantly updating your art style. What I mean is, every new video I see something new that you haven't done in a previous video.
I'm wondering if this is intentional, per chance, or whatever. Either way, I just hope the simplified blob aesthetic doesn't get too detailed.
But, it is your channel, and I cannot stop you guys from growing and expanding."
1,Maybe Naegleria Fowleri is trying to figure out what makes humans smart and mimic it for its own ends.
1,"Gotta be honest, Kurzgesagt, I'm not going to feel much dread about being tiny after watching a video about a much, much tinier, much more badass thing that would take me out in a week."
1,Zombies in a nutshell
1,I'd be worried but I'm fairly certain that if the amoeba got to me it'd just die of starvation.
1,So it goes from unnoticed to 7 star wanted level in a few days. Cool
1,my day always lights up when a new kurzgesagt video comes up
1,At  in the intro the monkey has diver flippers

2,Best episode so far. Thanks Kurzgesagt for your lovely work black_heart
1,Sussy cells
1,I just got a new phobia. Thanks kurzgesagt ! Seriously though I'll never swim in rivers or lakes in the future. Only the sea and regularly sterilized pools.
1,Phew didn't realise It's so rare. You'd have to be incredibly unlucky to get it
2,I love this channel Best Videos!
1,THE VIDEO STARTS AT 
1,"Really love Kurzgesagt! Bought his book for me and even some friends. 
But; is anyone else really distracted by the music this time? I have difficultly focusing."
1,"I remember studying for the first time about this amoeba in my Parasitology classes when i was in Med school, and to this day is probably the most frightening microrganism i had read about, it´s just equally concerning the possibility of catching it or having to treat someone with that 93-97 % of fatality. Thankfully in my country this particular amoeba it´s almost immposible to find but in some other countries like the US cases are known to be present. Thanks kurzgesagt for another awesome video, creating awereness, and fuelling nightmares :)"
1,"That only happens with people whos immune system is suppressed, healthy people are immune from this"
1,"The last part was so wholesome <3 I'm so happy this channel exists and grateful for all the artists that contribute for the videos. Also, thank you narrator ~"

1,It's just amazing how their quality has improved noticably after just one video.
1,"Naegleria fowleri seems like the perfect Plague Inc. pathogen that as soon as it mutates and becomes airborne will have disastrous consequences. Hopefully, further research is deemed as warranted and scientific study progresses smoothly..."

But since I'm kind of obsessed with swimming, I kept my own subscription winking_face_with_tongue

I guess I've survived till now due to my antibodies preventing it from entering my brain.

Can we take any measures to prevent it from entering it in the first place? Like cleaning our nose or stuff."

That 8 year old boy that died at Discovery Island, a Disney water park in 2001 because a brain eating amobea went up his nose: why didn’t you tell me this before!"
1,So I'm never diving into water again
1,Now Imagine that thing evolves to make you bite off peoples noses to get better into there and starts an apocalypse
2,"Thanks, I’m never swimming again"
1,This video is great but I don't understand why you had to sprinkle the unbearable cringe throughout the video and towards the end
1,"Day by day, kurzgesart animation are getting complex and smooth. Great video."
2,I laughed and cried with the addloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceface_with_tears_of_joyrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughing
1,Does it live in seas?
1,"I thought this would be a video about fascism, communism and socialism"
1, Credits to the guy who found out how to turn smaller than a hair
1,This is truly the way people should study
2,"Wow, okay. Wasn't expecting the visuals to be as terrifying as it was..."
1,Stay out of Hot Springs and Pounds and warm Lakes. It ain't worth the risk
1,"i know ill sound dumb but what if you live somewhere cold or have cold shower on the regular, would that help at all?"
1,bro im now scared to ever go in the pool
2,Why didn’t you save this for Halloween loudly_crying_face
1,You guys should make a video regarding the less talked about renewable energy. That being Geothermal and Hydrothermal Energy.
1,"I’ve actually had this! By far the worst thing I e ever had to deal with, I always have reoccurring hallucinations due to the remnants of the battle in and near my brain…  not very fun"
1,My favourite word said by the narrator: Billions

1,my heads been feeling weird ever since i watched this video lol
1,The human body is so amazing.
1,So this is my excuse for going to the swimming bath in summer.
1,"who is the voice of the existential dread guy, he sounds like the lad from jack box."
1,"I think the amoeba can enter your brain if you pick your nose after touching untreated water.

I’m probably (hopefully) wrong about this though."
1,He looks like ambush from doors
1,"Kurzgesagt really out here scaring us then says sike ""the chances are slim"" winking_face_with_tongue"
2,"Awesome, thanks for that."
1,As the vedio progressed... I became more and more sure that I will never step foot in a water body ever.... and then all of a sudden they showed that only 381 deaths since 1937.... Can't tell how relieved I felt after seeing that...
1,"

I'm sorry, but that cell looks *sus.*"
1,"Once again, Kurzgesagt demonstrates that top quality educational entertainment is real and it can be free to watch too. 

I've got a good few Kurzgesagt pins and the recent calendar and it makes me glad to think they're helping, even if only a little."
1,"After all these years, the narrator finally has his own bird"
1,"Better to not know it, cuz it just causes paranoia"
2,Love this channel!!! Please never die flexed_bicepsbeaming_face_with_smiling_eyes
2,"Joke’s on you, I don’t have a brain"
1,I’m sure this used to say the Most Overhyped not the most horrible!
1,Does anyone by any chance know what will happen if one those bactreias happen to appear in you eye?
1,Here I am telling myself pools are off limits and 400 people have died in 90 years... Still not going in pools that's too risky
1,"music is always good, but this one's an absolute banger"
1,Why I'm hearing is using nose plugs
1,i already saw that in german... it isnt more calming in english!
1,I bet 93% of woke people in twitter have amoeba
1,"I'm not afraid of the Amoeba.  With that few cases in that many years it isn't that scary.  What I AM afraid of, though, is humans trying to do research on it with the intention of creating biological weapons.  It is clear it can bypass all of our defenses, so their only job would be to find a way to ensure infection, it seems too easy for evil people like the US Government to do."
1,"animations got fucking jacked
keep up the good work"
1,"Biggest plot twist with a happy ending, in history. You guys are doing a great darn job and deserve the biggest support ever, love your vidsface_with_open_mouth"
1,Is there no cure?
1,yep that me never swimming again XDface_with_tears_of_joy
1,This is why I don't go swimming
1,Bring it on. I’m vaccinated.
1,So basically like german stormtroopers. You dont notice them until its too late.
1,This video is as entertaining as it was amazingly animated!
1,"I have never found something that so perfectly compliments all of my fears at once. Never have I loved water and I have always been terrified of things that harm the brain, I value intelligence more than anything and the potential loss of it is the worst thing I have ever thought of."
1,"I've heard of the ""brain-eating amoeba"" previously through YouTube clips from the series ""Monsters Inside Me"", a documentary show about Parasites.

On the TV, one time I saw on a documentary about this female coroner, she described the case of a  Lad who had various symptoms of fever, headaches, seizures, other shit. And his mother didn't know what the hell was wrong with him, he died after being admitted to hospital,

Well basically his cause of death needed to be determined, various stuff including the spinal fluid was checked, HIS BRAIN was apparently last to be checked, turned out he did have ""brain eating amoeba"", that he likely contracted from swimming in a body of freshwater on a summer's day.

I was kinda guessing it before she finally said it, she herself described it as being rare."
2,The animation only gets better
1,"Part of the problem with a disease like this that it's so rare, that even doctors may completely forget that it exists until it's too late.

For all we know, tens of thousands of people get the amoeba every year and it just gets obliterated before it enters the brain."
1,Dr. Eric Foreman probably has some experience with this particular pathogenic
1,Holy fuck. Why? This is horrible until you know unlikely it is to infect you.
1,"i always return to watch this video when i have a headache, makes me want to do things because i might not just have a headache"
1,The first thing I noticed about this video was the new animation style of some scenes. Go Off y’all!!!
1,"I've never felt so much understanding to the term ""ignorance is bliss"" after watching this."
1,COVID 19 is/was the most over hyped monster of all time.
2,Bruh at the end you hit us with a yeah it’s actually super rare 
2,these videos just do get better and better XD I've been laughing at how good everything is and how well explained everything is and I've been fanning over how everything is so well illustrated and epic and ughhhhh cnat put it itno wrdos... XDXDXD
1,"Fun fact: the baths in the city of Bath, England were open to the public for bathing until the 70's when a girl died of this disease. They have been closed for bathing ever since"
1,"Kurzgesagt is so inspiring! 
The work they put on their videos, the quality, the details! And It is free on youtube! Amazing in every aspect!"
2,Representation of dread was fun
2,"Great, now I have a fear of water"
1,The bad news is that this amoeba will really thrive and expand it's habitat due to climate change.
1,This is a big step up! No words!
2,hell yeah free lobotomy
1,"I feel headache, fever and nausea from watching this video."
1,"Truly, kurzgesagt, I respect you so much. Many of your videos inspired me exactly the way you meant them to, in the direction of science and be amazed by my universe.
But to me, this video doesn't line up with your cause.
To me, you represent finally, a responsible, and green organization.
But what is the purpose of this video? to cause unnecessary concern?
And why do you try to make your money through selling items and not by direct support? Does that line up with the green attitude you call to in your videos?
If you really were to support the fight against climate change as you show in your videos, you should choose another profit model. Don't get me wrong, I'm in love with your vids, waiting, and eagerly watching each and every one of them, for a long time now, and I want to see your organization expand and continue to educate beautifully. but not on the expanse of the environment.
Call your subscribers to support you on patreon, like you used to, instead of selling merchants."
1,Do I have to send you my theraphy bill or...?
0,Me that takes swimming classes:fu-
1,I am actually a swimmer:/
1,i remember hearing about this in sophmore year bio in hs

1,Hello I have a question I have a cold for about 2 months now not a big problem but dose that means that my immune system has failed or still fighting I would love to have a answer
1,Oh hey! Another reason why i have a phobia of large pools of water
1,"If you look up photos of Naegleria fowleri, it looks like a screaming clown."
1,"Damn it, Amoebas eating my brain cells, so that's why I'm so dumb."
1,I remember watching this when i had a headache.
1,"I have a friend whose mom died from this amoeba (Seattle, WA), thanks to using a Neti pot with tap water. It was a horrible way to die. 

I also just canceled my trip next week to go to Sliding Rock in North Carolina (super awesome natural water slide). I was already freaking out about scrapes and bruises (I have no spleen), but this just sealed the deal. Nope, nope, nope."
1,That song though… it gives off massive terraria vibes
1,This is what i love in kurzgesagt. They tell you whats dangerous and warn you of what it can cause but also comforts you at the end of the video cas they know that overthinking can hit but comforting about the danger just make you cautious
1,"It has literally just occurred to me how lucky I’ve been, a scraped knee is nothing compared to this"
1,Ooooh hell nah! Im never swimming again! Not even washing my nose with water. What tha heck! I rather die getting eaten by a pack of hyenas than this shiet!
2,"hello fellow struggler. In this dark and unfair world, i just thought i'd let you know that God loves you and to never stop loving yourself and pursuing happiness."
0,New animation which is cool as hell
2,nice Spore gameplay :D
1,then just get a brain freeze I guess
2,The self-promotion at the end was so clever and fun to watch!
1,"Immune system has no reason NOT to nuke everything , I this point its either bomb HQ base or lose everything"
1,why was the title changed?
0,So thats why tiktokers are dumb
1,"You guys should make a video on aliens, and the US airforce's sightings / documentation of them. What it could mean, or even the type of propulsion / technology they appear to have."
1,amazing production
0,"I've had a brain eating amoeba once, poor fella died of hungary"
1,WIAT WAIT WAIT BUT IM ANOTHER VIDEOS IT SAY YOU HAVE EVERY KIND OF CELL IN YOUR BODY FOR EVERY DISEASE SO WOUNDNT  YOU STILL LIVE?!! I WANA KNOW MORE
1,Absolutely terrified despite the low risk factor--but still giving the video a like because it's good information and the animation was a step-above today.
1,Holy! The brain cell eater
1,"We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I (do I)
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it)
Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)
We know the game and we're gonna play it"
0,Fear unlocked.
1,It's a good thing that a lot of us are gamers and never go outside. We would be be in danger otherwise!
1,"So, who's up for a swim ?"
1, Kurzgestagt is starting their own anime i see
1,'' and devours your braincells'' wait i have braincells?
1,So basically if we pay attention to the life guards and don’t jump into the pool we’re fine?
1,"This is taking ""I'm losing braincells"" to a whole new level"
1,Am I the only one that felt really sad when he said that at this point our cells fight back with everything they've got... loudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_face
1,Mf knows it causes existencial crisis
1,"Man a whole  video of my brother!
how cool"
1,brian eater eats brain
1,I… need an adult.
1,"This reminds me of a thing called Mad Cow  disease, Incase somebody doesn't know what it is, it's practically when harmful proteins (which I forgot the name of) go to the cow's brain, then start eating HOLES into it! Luckily it's not common in humans beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes"
1,I'm sure that I'm not the only one who was thinking about how their graphics have improved immensely compared to the previous ones.
1,"So, basically this amoeba happened evolve in the right way that if in the low chance that it happens to reach our brain it's perfectly suited to survive our defense mechanism...

The wonders of nature."
1,It would be cool if your brain had like bodyguard cells to defend against bacteria targeting ur brain like this one
1,"Depression already in my mental. No place for brain eaters. But thanks for giving anxiety, it makes people laugh at me because stress gives white stuff on my hair. Laughs are fun but I don't laugh. Wish to not exist anymore. That black goo at the end is the size of my depression."
2,This is terrifying. Thanks.
1,here after a guy in Iowa got it from a public pool
1,Me: thinking about all the times water got shoved up my nose.
1,"When I was a child, I swam in an unclean river and choked.smiling_face_with_halo"
1,Aww phillip dettmer 's Bird is so cute!
1,"i am immune to this amoeba because to have your brain eaten, you must have a brain in first place, and i don't"
2,This should win an Academy Award or something.
1,"It seems 3D and STRANGE
What happened to that blue bird"
1,I wonder if you could use bacteriophages as a Way of fighting against this amoeba
1,"Swam in a pool on Saturday, today I have a runny nose and got a bit dizzy. Now I see this video. Couldn't finish it because my anxiety shot through the roof.

I'm going to die."
1,"A rare but horrifying infection indeed. Rare as cases may be, we still need a reliable way to counter the siege once it's underway."
1,I don't know why but Kurzgesagt reminds me of the narrator from The Stanley Parable
1,Just commenting to show off my own bird! beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,seing how the immune system fight for your life makes me smile idk why
1,I aspire to be as badass as neutrophils.
1,Oh baby. Here we go.
1,The bacterial chuck noris
1,"when I was in med school this, fatal familial insomnia (and really all the prion diseases), and glioblastoma multiforme were imho probably some of the most horrifying ways to die. just something about neurologic fatalities, man... and how they so often hide until it's waaay too late"
1,that bird in the end will become a meme
1,Ngl the guy in the video was cute loool
1,this gives me new respect for my immune system
1,"The animation of Kurzgesagt has always been good, but there was a definite step up in animation quality in this video, amazing smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes Cool topic also, greetings from an internal medicine doctor slightly_smiling_face"
1,Interesting! So it’s a cytokine storm that kills you. I live in the southern US and I remember a few years ago a little panic when someone was infected and it made the news.
2,"Well, that escalated quickly."
1,"I remember when this video was called ""the most overhyped monster"""
1,"Ok. No more swimming in fresh-water in hot weather; seas and oceans only from now on. Thanks, Kurzgesagt for ruining my future tropical holidays."
1,"What I learned: dont ever, EVER swim in lakes."
1,My favourite channel is KURTSGESAGT!!!
1,"The animation is so astonishingly beautiful! Script is super engaging, and amoebas are freaking scary. You did it again, but with much improved quality."
1,"Aight, guess I’ll never get within 10 feet of water again"
1,The self promo at the end actually cracked me up. Thx face_with_tears_of_joy
1, this caught me off guard hahahaha
1,Can you make a poster and videos that tackles all the elements in the periodic table?
0,I put one up my nose once poor thing died of hungerskull
1,so... Im never swimming again
2,This video looks like it sas animated by gods. Amazingly beautifull work!
1,"thank for spreading more needless fear about something that will effect no one who watches this video lol. And I see the title has changed from ""over hyped"" to ""horrible"" because you did nothing to say it was over hyped in any shape or form, brilliant."
1,"We should require everyone to remove their Brain by Law, So no one will die from Brain Eating Amoeba. Safety First, Think of the Children !!!!"
1,Key here is to not swim in fresh water.
1,It sounds like your talking about cod ww2 zombies
1,I'm thinking that I might just stay out of open water. Like no one has died from a shark attack on land unless you believe the events of the documentary sharknado. I can also avoid the brain eating amoeba by not going in the water.
1,"You know this shit is real when there are at least 4 Monsters Inside Me episodes dedicated to the amoeba. 
(Some of them are of another strain, Balamuthia Mandrillaris, so I guess they count as different diseases?)"
1,"*I know more than 100-150 people who likes your videos, but I was never saw your single hater.*"

1,This is why I don't live in America
1,"A bit worried every time I swim now, but damn is this animation good-

Also…Why the hell do I have the concerning urge to get some and test how they work by using them against others o-o"
1,The original title was like “overhyped amoeba” or something cuz yea it’s overhyped
1,This is rare but still scary
0,"“Some people have to deal with it”. That’s an awful, idiotic statement… all of these people will die from it."
1,the mech ad segment at the end was internet historian levels of good ad
1,"I love the massive upgrade in quality, it really goes look awesome. The topic of this video genuinely makes me feel so scared, never even TOUCHING water again..."
1,Reminder to self. Check the chlorine level in the pool.
1,The quality of animation is literally accelerating between each video.... I am just happy to see educational content get great quality explanation and visuals. All of your efforts to make a little detail look even better are totally worth it. keep it up guys.
2,As a scuba diver I love to hear good news like this face_with_tears_of_joy
1,"I read about this parasite a few years ago. I think 1960, it killed several people in Czechoslovakia."
2,"the dread bit was really fun lol

va nailed it"
1,Imagine how terrifying and insanely demented it would be if some deranged scientist or whatever modified these things to make them contagious and use as a BOW
1,Woah. The animation quality has improved amazingly over the years. Let's go!! clapping_hands
2,"big props to the animators, this is great"
2,"That was great, and kind of  terrifying! 

Do you think you could do a video on what if the earth suddenly stopped spinning?"
1,"Nice, now we have the 3D animation in Kurzesagt video :D"
0,this physically made my brain hurt
1,"HIS PROCLIVITY TO EXPLORE IS THAT OF AN ANCIENT EXPLORER FROM A PRINCIPALITY, FROM CIRCA B.C.E. YET HIS TENDENCY OF BENEVOLENCE IS THAT OF AN ANCIENT EXPLORER FROM A MUNICIPALITY FROM CIRCA A.D.

1,This episode is the one that made me decide to start supporting kurzgesagt
1,My daughter ran away from home can you help me?
1,"My sister died to this, the last thing I saw of here was just being a slack-jawed body on the gurner that didn’t even look alive after taking a small dive into a local hot spring. I was young at the time and Inside Out came at the same time this happened. I remember that because I couldn’t be there at the hospital anymore and a friend of the family took me to that instead. I have never cried so hard in my life, especially during the imaginary friend forgetting scene. Despite how rare it is, it’s still awful to experience."
0,That end ad was cute what the fuck
1,The music in this one was amazing
1,WHY ARE THE GRAPHICS ARE TERRIFYING THIS EPISODE???
0,And so my fear of swimming is further justified.
1,"For some reason, the human at the begging of the video gave me the creeps"
1,"Ah, just what I need less than a month from traveling to a warm, tropical country. thumbs_up"

A man jumped into a lake. This is what happened to his brain..."

0,Good thing youtube is banned in china.
1,"I learn this before this video
So do not put your head inside a hot spring
As it is hot and usually untreated"
1,Guys I recently enjoyed my time in beach if I didn't replied to this comment then IAM probably not alive anymore
1,waiting for 500 comment bots
1,Wc back
1,This was the most terrifying video I’ve ever seen. I’ll never be able to look at the pool the same again. What looked cool and refreshing before now just looks like a cesspool of potential death. Thanks! >.<
1,"Dude if you release more videos like this, people will be afraid of going outside because there are bacterias/viruses everywhere"
1,I want to learn more send another one
1,"-10 of my braincells
the amoeba ate em"
1,"I live in florida and around 10 years ago a girl named Amanda died from this within 7 days, it's absolutely horrible, it only grows in very hot water 79+ very scary."
1,bruh this whole video was a rollercoaster
1,My brain watched this and got a lot more worried than usual about the damage. Probably because normally it can sit back while the meat-sac takes the hits.
1,"Just had a swim in unclohrineated water, got reccomended this, fears I will perish within the next week"
1,"I love the video very informative. One thing though. The more detailed and slightly more 3d was weirdly off-putting. I am not sure if you went for off-putting as a dramatic tool or if it was just trying a new style. But I think I prefer the old minimalist. Once again great video, I love the depth and detail you all dive into for us. Thank you for all your work."
1,"I should get myself checked for this, I've been getting dumber for the past few years"
1,"Nice try amoebas making videos, not gonna trick me into getting in the water."
1,"as someone who lives in a region where this Amoeba is very present, im just not gonna watch the video in order to keep my self from going crazy."
1,"I work with lake water in Florida, just had some filthy lake water blasted up my nose last Friday by accident... And now I'm nervous lol"
2,What a great video to watch before you sleep
1,"I wanna give a big shout-out to the animators. Fantastic job, I really appreciate it!"
1,Hello but this is the second comment
1,"Insane animation as always, but the humans and the motion of the flying moths were **chef's kiss**"
1,Me who had this symptoms and lived:am I supposed to be dead or did my body just survive?
1,"Don’t forget balamuthia mandrillaris. The second brain eating amoeba, and equally rare."
1,I live in Florida and that’s not the only horrible thing in here there is also a flesh eating bacteria in rise of hurricane Ian
1,Ahem I just found in J-bug youtuber in video was kurzgesagt beatbox AND Once I check in comment You were there... EXPLAIN!! Why you comment
1,I just wanted to ask…does this “brain eating amoeba” live in shower and bath water at home in CHINA?

The brain eaters."
1,Existential Dread is now my favorite recurring Kurzgesagt character

I am still in middle school, but I enjoy watching your videos. I learn so much from the videos, even though they stir up the fears that lurk in our lives each and every time. Thanks for the great videos Kurzgesagt!"
2,This is the best channel on YouTube… no competition.
2,Best animation yet

1,new fear unlocked: small bug that crawls into me while i swim and eats my brain
1,"Problem is they usually are in deep lakes or ponds you would most likely have to dive almost to the bottom to get it, yes sometimes there are times where it does multiply rapidly usually in the summer months but you would still need to dive almost half way down"
2,"Ok, I’m done with water"
1,"""Pool fun--------> Death"": Literal exploding_head"
1,"Whoever had the idea to make that merchandise plug at then end, you are a creative genius."
1,Scariest video I've seen in a while.
1,I'm now struggling to understand. This sounds like MS in some ways.
1,Amoebas make me want to go to to a lake and remove the water and burn it and refill it with holy water.
1,"Oh my god I got so scared since I just swam In a not very good filtered pool and at the  I felt so relieved,  like 80% of the video I was scared to death, the rest 20% I felt relieved but very pissed since you guys set it up as a big thing lol"
1,Ugh. WHY did you have to use wolves as the bad guys in that forest analogy? I think it's time you do a video on how wolves are scientifically proven to be absolutely essential to the ecosystem.
2,Kind of you to remind me of this lovely bug.  Fitting under the circumstances.
1,"This is why cringe when people use neti pots with tap water. Though, probably they will be fine."

me: UR TELLING ME THIS AFTER THE VIDEO?!?!"
1,The animation of the human at  completely blew me away... keep up the good work Kurzgesagt!!!
1,"Thanks, I will never ever jump into a lake again"
1,I notice and appreciate the upgrade of animation and graphic quality since the last video!
1,Gotta say the animations are so much more detailed
1,The animation on this channel is absolutely beautiful!
1,Just think about the time before air conditioning and pools when everyone would use natural pools of water to cool off during hot summers.
0,"BUT why is it so horrible? Amoeba has a right to exist just like we do right? It needs to feed on brains thats not its fault.
why is it horrible if it harms humans, but ok if it harms anything else? Are we so special?

Next you will call a lion evil, because it eats zebra.
or a cow evil because it kills the grass it eats."

1,"This is one of those things that youre constantly worried about even though you know, deep down, that the chances of it happening to you are as small as the planck length.

1,"Bruh, if you're spending 1000's of man hours on 10 mins videos 4x a year.... this isn't the way."
1,"Hopefully kurzgesagt or somebody who knows this will reply

If the amoeba is that good at countering the immune system then does that mean (based on your last video) the immune system has a response to it or is it completely ineffective since the way the immune system counters the opponents is by using antibodies but antibodies are just     Swallowed up so would the immune system be able to counter or not?"
1,"Thanks, I'll never swim again."
1, lore? Someone call film theory
1,I become very terrified and feel very uncomfortable after this video because I remember I took hot water in my nose in thermal spring because of my mom told me its healthy. I realize I was very lucky to not get that bacteria.

Also in 2022 there was only 3 registered cases, you are fine.

This would send them to code."

1,"How to get existential crisis:
step 1: watch kurzgesagt
step 2 : profit"
1,"I have a hypothesis as to why these ameba are so attracted to acetylcholine of all things and it might explain why they're so equipped to put up serious resistance to our immune systems. When in particularly favourable conditions (or exceedingly unfavourable), bacteria have a method of forming pseudo-mulitcellular colonies called biofilms. The most common one most people interact with daily is the plaque that forms on our teeth pretty much 24/7. Have you ever wondered how bacteria can form a substance so hard that, if you don't continually brush and floss them off, you often need metal tools to clear off? The answer is that the plaque forming bacteria which are attempting to consume your teeth form a biofilm, working together to shield themselves from our immune system, saliva and physical forces like flossing and brushing in order to both make it harder to remove them as well as make it easier to eat our teeth. The ""blob"" of bacteria will generate intra-cellular bonds to link themselves together and will begin dividing the work of defence and feeding amongst themselves which requires a great deal of signaling and, if you find a chemical in your body, there is a 99% chance it was first used by bacteria billions of years ago and has stuck around all the way up until now (I have a biochem degree, it's kinda just a rule of thumb you end up learning). To add to the probability they use that kind of signaling, we have recently found that the microbiota in our guts actually directly releases neurotransmitters and that is what actually gives us our cravings for specific foods... usually bacteria that have been raised on a food continue to crave it which is why you can easily get stuck wanting unhealthy food if you only eat it for a moderate amount of time

However, in the case of our ameba, it is likely that our terrifying brain-eating species here is used to hunting biofilms and so is attracted by the neurotransmitters they would use. Attacking a mass of cells gives far more food than hunting single targets but one of the main problems is that biofilms are far more resilient and ready to fight than most solo bacteria so it would need adaptations to stand a chance against its prey. The attack chemicals are likely meant to scatter defensively oriented clumps, the feeding cups are likely to tear out chunks of teamed defensive fighters and the anti-complement defence is likely to overcome any chemical defences the biofilm produces (often made to make it inhospitable to competing microbes). This ameba would then be geared for war with far more varied and hardened team-strategies than we can put up especially in an immune-system excluded zone like the central nervous system so all it needs is to make it their alive for it to be the best feeding bonanza it could ever hope for... if unicellular life is somehow capable of emotions like hope..."

1,"A comment  with a lot of brotherly love and respect
Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? THe worlds fullest duality healer can heal body and soul both? Did he take the place of Lord Jesus who is the only one who can heal the ill begotten soul? 
[Mathew 15: 19] “For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies”:
Only God can heal the soul from sins. [Luke 5: 2]  And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? 
Who is Lord Jesus? [Revelation 21:6] “Lord Jesus Christ is the ALPHA and the OMEGA, the CAUSE of the CREATIONAL BEGINNING, the CAUSATION OF CREATION, the SUPREME and UPMOST PURPOSE FOR ALL CREATIONS 
Do not ever complain to Lord Jesus at His Second Coming that He did not care enough to send someone to warn you of your philosophies that will allwow the devil upon the exit of your soulds from the body to claim your souls for all eternity! 
Lord Jesus did not come to teach philosophically but THERAPEUTICALLY.(TO CURE MAN FROM SIN)
The term ""Orthodox Psychotherapy"" does not refer to specific cases of people suffering from psychological problems of neurosis. Rather it refers to all people, for it is the darkening of the “nous” (mind) a condition disabling man to ever have communion (PERSON to person) with God.

1,Awesome. Thank you so much. Learnt a very important rule. I needed it as learning is a continuous process in life. One take back from the video is - Our state of life is so valuable at every aspect of our lives. For example - Parents tend to demoralise or scold children for studies which in turn result in poor performances or lack of motivation coz they take away the dignity of the child. Thank you for sharing. Even though I am an unmarried woman but I can share this with people I know.

1,"First of all, we must to know how much is full time."
1,"When i started getting BOMBED with repeated advertisement of mindvalley on YouTube i was oh wow this jim kwick's thing is something i never heard of i will surely take the course cz i was sooo interested in speed reading ...i fancied being able to read like shu shu shu ...and a 300 page book done in a sitting of one side of my home to college commute...BUT THEN....

I saw the price of course was around rs22000 !! I mean its around the monthly salary a starting engineer or accountant with an mediocre graduation from a mediocre college gets ... Of course a student isn't gonna have that much ...i was broken hopeless...
In search of getting a good high paid part job from home i bought a 500 rs. Course (I got 2000rs from relatives ....even they understand my broke condition and gave me 'unemployment allowance'face_with_tears_of_joy ... there i saw advertisment of Jonathan levi's superlearner 2.0 course (LAW OF ATTTRACTION ) and this one didn't asked for 22000 but just 450rs. ..i bought it got started and, this guy......he introduced me to THE WORLD OF MEMORY MENTORS and those who are working on their memory with different magnificent memory personalities ...like jonathan levi anthony metivier joshuo forver(not sure about spelling but joshua is a *us memory champion*  and author of moonwalking with Einstein) 

See, I don't mean to disrespect anyone specially not vishen lakhani who got this brilliant idea of ripping people off their money with these overpriced courses with all these hocus pocus videos in all these big auditoriums in big cities , people ARE greedy in this world and all of us know it very well.....BUT(back to jim kwick)

Of all those podcasts of big memory personalities all those ted talks in which memory masters were recommending other memory masters and their methods ....NEVER did i hear any mention about JIM KWICK ....yet his course has to be like....44x expensive then Jonathan levi's superlearner 2.0 and Anthony metivier's magnetic memory method...etc etc 

So I came this far writing such along comment just to warn you that before dumping your hard-earned money in mindvalleys overly overpriced course do explore your options...check reviews properly and just don't get into the hypnotisingly convincing and confident accent of Vishen ..i know it is difficult for a normal human mind ...many have already enrolled into the course ..you are the lucky one to be reading this...

.....BEFORE THIS COMMENT GETS DELETED BY MINDVALLEY I WANT ATLEAST 10 PEOPLE GET BENEFITED FROM THIS ....."

If you are a beginner to meditation, this CD will walk you through all the steps of relaxing and breathing as well as sending out the positive thoughts of love and kindness that will be returned to you. We have several CD's, but this one is a favorite that we choose most often."

I think your voice's volume must fluctuate fepending on the importance of your topic. Your tone is the same all over the video. I think this strategy might benefit you as a divider between your objectives in a certain video 
Thanks!"

1,Thank you so much for this valuable information!
1,How to learn x2 faster. Watch the video in x2 speed ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1,U are really very inspiring person
1,Awesome advice i have exam after 3 days
1,thanks to this man i now know many different ways to hide bodys and eat cats
2,Thank you
1,Whenever im learning to do something new i always act like im teaching it to myself and already know it and it kind of works
1,Nothing useful here....

YT Title : Speed Learning : Learn in half the time Jim Kwik

Effective learning : be aware of F.A.S.T, apply it to yourself.

F - FORGET (What you know already, start from scratch...)
  when you create a whole memory from start to finish you build it like a house on foundations , the foundations you choose hence you remember all of it holistically not peice by peice
A - ACTIVE (be an active participant as the best learning technique)
  Google ""Pyramid of learnings""...2 types of learning style 
  non participatory (NP) vs participatory Style (PS). 
  Least effective is NP (reading watching listening being shown), 
  Most effective is PS (discussing practicing teaching)...all are active styles
  PS counts for >75% of your learning success !!
S - STATE (your state has a big effect on how you learn)
 Being happy you are closer to being in the zone where you are listening better with focus
 Being unhappy or upset you are distracted further from being in the zone further from listening at your best (with focus)
Combine a ( positive ) emotion to facts and you commit to long term memory. Conversely...
 Combine repetition to facts and you commit to short term memory
T - TEACH ( 80-20 rule, learning yourself acquires 80% of the subject, teaching to someone else acquires the last 20% of the subject, the hardest bit)
  Teaching reinforces what you learn and fills in the gaps you hadn't thought of. 
 As Jim Kwik says ""Teach and you learn it twice""

By sharing I've completed my teaching component of how to learn effectively.

Learning facts...using 'House of Loki' next 
- also known as The Memory Palace 
- learn anything like 'a story' (exactly as you would recount your holiday to someone...a series of facts or events presented as a story told)
 - with LOKI ensure the story is in repeating 2 steps : person journey person journey etc. If you were to remember a long series of playing cards...you don't lose yourself if you know the next card must be a journey card since the last was a person card. Useful trigger tip !
- the fact (card) you remember as a memorable journey (a short hop from room to room...just like your holiday story) or memorable person (a memorable object to be general)
 - Google YT video to see impressive example of Loki 
  ""Jimmy Carr astonished by Nick Mohammeds card trick""...

1,"I always skip ads... But there you were in this video and you were utterly captivating Jim! Your analysis is spot on and totally relatable. I love your focus and ability to translate and expose the answer simply, to a complex and worthy question. Excellent expression of self and purpose and for the first time ever, yours was an ad I was glad to come across."
2,thanks
1,easy. watch the video on x2 speed
1,Sir in one of the video you told that our thoughts are our brain's program and our brain is a super computer. Whatever program I will make and execute the mind will give result according to that. So when I will be thinking about forgetting what I have studied till now so my question is this that will it result in actual forgetting of past studied things then it should be of no avail.
1,YES I AM A THERMOSTAT
1,I am too silly that I have to come back here to remember how to learn fast.
1,i didn't get half of what this dude was talking about
1,uh oh Jim all of your stuff suddenly makes precise sense to me now...
1,"His Eye-Engagement is next level
Also, this video was truly informative

1,"1. Forget everything you know about the concept and start learning as if you don't know anything.
2. Get yourself in a excited to learn mindset by looking at your heroes and remembering why you're learning this in the first place.
3. Actively engage with the material by asking questions or taking great notes, keep in mind as if you're going to teach it later because that forces you to learn in properly
4.  Then actually teach the material. Even if it's out loud to your self."

I don't mean to be a smart ass and i get that it's just an analogy, nonetheless isn't there a ""mistake"" either in the formula or in the explanation when you on the one hand say ""if you times anything by zero you get zero"" (x * 0 = 0) (which is definitely true :D) but on the other hand show a formula that says: information ""+"" emotion = long-term memory (which by the way solely also makes sense for me)?"

Not so sure about that"
2,"Great, wasted my  time.. smiling_face"
1,"First remember the first four letters FAST 
F=Forget: You have to forget what you already know about the subject in order to learn something brand new. Start with a beginner's mind. Forget about your limitations because your learning is absolutely limitless.
A=Active: Your brain doesn't learn based on consumption it learns based on creation. Learning is not a spectator sport, you have to be involved, you have to be active. 
S=State: The current mood of your mind and body because information plus emotions equals long term memory and that's the main key to a really good memory. All learning is state dependant. Control your state to learn more. You are a thermostat and not a thermometer. Trade your cleverness for bewilderment. 
T=Teach: learn it like you are going to teach it to somebody else. When you teach something you get to learn it twice"
1,this guy is a robot
2,thanks for share this information. this meaning a lot for me.
1,"You can teach 3x actually. You read something, then do summaries, not just notes, and this is in preparation for when you explain it to someone . Since you've already written it in your own words it makes the explaining easier. Also, the act of writing re-enforces memory as well."

1,I’m here because I want to join the Marines and need to pass the Asvab test in two weeks lol and I really want a high score
1,"After emptying your mind, how do you keep what you already know while you try to learn what’s new?"
1,"I agree how he explains forget. ""Forget about the things around you and forget about your limitations.""
But I like the word compare, compare what you know to what you are learning and then compare and contrast the different points. Because it's hard to forget stuff if you already know it and it's going to require more energy to start with a beginners mind."

1,"I've come to look at this video, because I have a friend at school, he probably has straight A's and somehow learns really fast in school, and is pretty done with all of his work before everyone else pretty much all the time. (We're freshmen in high school) Not sure if this is how he does it, but I gotta learn how, it's flippin crazy."
1,"I think that by hearing, reading, saying what you have learned out loud, then writing what you have learned done and finally repeating these steps at least 5 times will allow for you to learn so much quicker than normal."
1,Thanksclapping_hands
2,You are really great
1,"The thing is though, he explains to you all these methods you can use to remember things faster, basically saying everyone can remember things like he can. Yet when he's on stage remembering all those numbers and names, he doesn't use any of the methods and strictly uses his brain to remember these things. What i'm trying to say is that his ability to remember things cannot be learned and is congenital. 

Don't get me wrong, these methods do work to an extend, but they are commonly known."
1,"I got mostly straight A's, 2 master's degrees, teacher certification, and I'm a bit of an ""expert"" on meta-cognition. I taught others to monitor their own learning. This is the best summary of the field I have ever seen. I think this is by far the best 6 minutes anyone can spend to improve their learning. The smarter you are, the more important this video is, because intelligence and hubris go hand in hand and hubris inhibits learning. This video basically tells you to approach new material like a child. Of course, don't have this attitude on the debate stage!"

 This was very helpful! thank you Jim :D"

1,"I am a firm believer of the philosophy of flow, few in the world can comprehend the teaching without words, or understand the value of non-action.
The human brain is far more complex than we think, we already have all the gears to accomplish tasks, people do things naturally like you don’t need to think how to swing your arms and legs so that you are balanced while walking. I personally struggle with rumination and depression, all these Ted-talks and ways to do things are intoxicating our brain. You don’t really need meditation to empty your mind, your body is programmed to fall asleep or zone out when your brain needs a rest. You don’t really need to know Maslow’s Hierarchy to achieve self-actualization. Researchers in 20’s believed that you should never kiss or hug your baby, people in 60’s considered bilingualism as a handicap, people 50 years in the future might think that we are so stupid to try so hard finding ways to do things."

I just started posting weekly videos after growing a podcast to 25k monthly downloads in a year. My learning has been exponential now that I summarize what I learn and teach it to others! fire

I am trying to raise funds to be able to return to university since I had to abandon it to help my mother and my brother, I currently work repairing clothes, and I do some work such as rehearsals or crafts but I cannot go back to school, I am trying to develop bags for myself, my idea is to incorporate organic materials that do not pollute the planet, so I can help myself to work and thus be able to go back to school, I want to study architecture, please take the time to read my story and my idea to get ahead, if you can help me by donating or sharing my message to more people I would appreciate it, if you have questions ask me, the least I want is for them to think that I want to scam them when all I am looking for is to achieve my dream of being an architect:
This is my campaign where I explain my situation and my idea I hope you can help me:

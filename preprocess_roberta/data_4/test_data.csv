1,"Kurzgesagt - Your  Videos  are  Soo  Informative  and  Top  Notch  Quality  
Keep  Up  The  Good  Work  folded_hands_light_skin_tone"
1,"A vaccine is a weakened form of a virus inserted in the body, not the BS they gave people with the SARS-COV2 one"
1,This video is way better than school teaching
1,This video was sponsored by pfizer and the WEF
1,"""Neutrophils . . . Imagine crazy aggessive chimps with machine guns."" --- Yes, that's exactly what I think of when thinking about Neutrophils :)"
2,"Subhanallah ,god is merciful"
1,Experimental Vac gave my sis Lupus (given @ her birth)
1,I can't believe we still need to try to educate people on vaccines in 2023.
1,"This was titled ""The best way to boost your immune system"", but later it was changed to ""Your immune system is more dangerous than you think""
For a second I started questioning reality, because I swear I saw a different title, Kurzgesagt was gaslighting me face_with_tears_of_joy"
1,Bro i dont get sick when normal i get sick when i get nausea
1, what do the shapes remind you of?
2, that i wished you saw
1,The last vaccine didn’t help much…
1,"""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, except for artillery. Artillery will just f*cking kill you!"""
1,"It's honestly frustrating how Anti-Vaxxers think just because it has side effects, it's not worth taking. Like yeah, it's not gonna magically stop the disease completely, but it keeps it more contained."
2,Yuh.  Love this channel
1,"Interesting video, but you lost me at the 9 minute mark when you mentioned climate change, something that humans do not have a significant impact on."
1,"I swear, all this stuff feels boring, but when it's explained by Kurzgesagt, I feel I could listen to them talking about a single molecule of oxygen."
1,But with innovations everything will be fine
0,"I hate viruses, bacteria and parasites."
1,This is some much appreciated and unexpected validation!
1,As a healthy non smoking 24 yo I remember it took me 4 months to feel like my breathing was normal again after recovering from covid.
1,"I'm Healthy nearly since entire life. 
I had just one invasion of flu as adolescent when I was 15-year-old and I laid flat for two weeks, but since that time I wasn't getting sick that strong anymore. Now since ten years I've never had anything again. It's like my body became immune against nearly every disease so far and no I've only received the vacine against tetanus around about 5 years ago. But no other vacine I had so far again neither against covid or the flu itself. Lastest flu vaccination is about over 15 years ago and now here I am. Some scientist claim that there is no human on earth with a perfect immunsystem. Well think again."
1,"Uhhh hate to say it, but covid gets worse the more you catch it - not milder"
1,I don't wanna watch your videos since Bill gates foundations propaganda
1,A message to future generations: Please keep this channel and others like it alive. They are the champions of free education. smiling_face_with_halo
2,Yea I can say one of the best way to explain...can u help in providing transcript of same which will help In  teaching the children in native language. Thank u
1,"And of course, there are those folks whose immune system overreacts and we suffer from autoimmune diseases. Mine manifests itself as chronic plaque psoriasis and joint issues. Others experience more sever symptoms. Some of us just can’t win. man_shrugging_light_skin_tone"
1,"I loved this video so much.  It hits so close to home.  I'm an RN and was a supervisor in California's Test To Treat/COVID Test sites.  I dealt with so much misinformation with both the public AND other healthcare professionals.   After 2+ years and seeing such a wide spectrum of ""perspectives"", I feel like the people who are most likely to benefit from this kind information are the ones who have already made up their minds.

This is just my opinion and I truly hope it's just been my approach but a lot of these people are seemingly dead set against anything that isn't put forth by their political leaders.  ""Vaccines are myths (even polio vax), hospitals are responsible for killing people,  current vaccinations are all about Big Pharm money (yet IVERMECTIN is OK) and somehow not a part of Big Pharm.""

Regardless, thanks for a really informative video.  I'll definitely be using some of these analogies!  This video was absolutely brilliant!!"
0,experimental vaccines are more dangerous than you think
1,Explain to use how you boosted your income with $570.000 from Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. How about that?
1,The title is missleading.
1,"I know you need to make money, but less carbon offset scams and more direct action, yeah?

Where are the calls for the simple math of guillotines and conservatives and centrists?"
1,I wouldn't lump the Covid vaccine in with the rest of the tried and tested vaccines.
1,Depends who paid for the science. Look at the covid vaccines. $$$
1,"It's amusing to get pre-roll ads about shoddy immune system boosting supplements just because this video's title. 
Try and keep up, algorithm mate."
1,Anyone else sick rn face_with_thermometerpensive_face
1,could your immune system trys to kill another people?
1,Can u do please an ant vidio about lasius niger plz
1,How can I min max my immune system
1,"yeah thank god every vaccine is effective, safe and without side effects, especially the most recent one..."
1,"I just went through a pretty intense COVID infection, so this is really cool to see!"
1,"I do not believe that humanity is the cause of the climate change and if it is able to influence the natures normal periodic warmings and coolings. Our influence is negligible. I'm more inclined to think that all CO2 fake is just another way for our government to collect new taxes and to earn few more billions or trillions and do nothing with the climate, because it can not be done anything... I do not know how someone can change my mind, because all this CO2 fake can not be proven. All media and scientists are bribed to say propaganda or silenced by governments. Nobody can be trusted anymore. We have reached the information war century. Nobody says the truth, nobody knows the truth, it is really very sad..."
1,"
there were times when I was sick for few days and lost few kg of my body weight. so that's why..."
1,"The fact that measssels has come
back bc of the Natural Dojo
pplface_with_tears_of_joy"
1,Evert video beating the drum of climate change... We get alright just stay on topic. Constantly wailing about the climate is getting rather irritating
1,"I currently have enteritis in my stomach area and have an infection in there as well.  Im in Week 2 of this and it's horrible.

Thankfully, i will have antibiotics for this tommorow but this video gives me hope that my immune system can take this thing down as well.

By the way, do antibiotics help your immune system as well?"
0,These guys and their climate doomsday bullshit. There is no 'climate crisis' - Stop pushing a political agenda while pretending to be objective.
1,"I would have loved to have this video around 2 years ago, I would have helped a lot. I my self have a lot of medical knowledge, but getting other to understand these complex progresses is another topic."
2,does kurzgesagt have a video about immunodeficiency? that would be very interesting and helpful
1,Noo not muscles brio
1,not first
1,You didn't discuss how mRNA vaccines differ from traditional vaccines. Very disappointing. My opinion of you just dropped several points. Do more research on the side effects of mRNA vaccines. I don't think you did a proper job on this video. Do you receive any funding from Pfizer or other pharma companies? I'd like to know.
1," there is a point there where I had a mini anxiety attack, because it sounded JUST LIKE my phone's alarm tone.."
0,Kurzgesagt just cannot admit they were wrong about the covid vaccines.
1,Great video! Still not getting that corny covid vax :)
0,like for Wilhelm scream.
1,"certain nurses have this saying: what doesent kill you makes you stronger, or cripples you for life"
1,I haven't watched the video yet but I have experienced this kind of thing before. Let me share my story briefly: I'm 14 years old and I have rheumatoid arthritis. I'm being watched by many doctors across my region cause it was and is so problematic. It was caused by my immune system overreacting to some nonsense (maybe even nonexisting) danger in my ankle. I don't suffer from any pain but I wish it finally comes to end.
1,"You can also develop autoimmune diseases where your immune system starts to attack parts of your own body tissue that has resembling spike proteins to the virus in question.
This can be extremely debilitating"
1,"Pov My immune system:- I am naturally immune to chickenpox, measles, and pink eye,
Also My Immune system:- Shit there is a dust particle, engage full-on battle against this godly figure, put the body in a crisis, and most importantly do not allow the body to breathe!"
1,The same people telling us the Covid vaccine is safe are the same people telling us it's effective.
1,"I am actually questioning my reality, this video comes out, then the next day, I wake up with a fever.
In his last video, it was about cells or biology, and somehow it was the exact topic we started leaning in school exactly a day earlier."
1,Governments should hire Kurzgesagt to teach people and spread awareness about all the things like these…
1,Lets go another one already
1,"fun fact: this video was called ""the best way to boost your immune system"" before it was changed

edit: shit it was changed back.. uuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..
fun fact: this video used to be called ""the dangers of your immune system"" before it was changed"
1,Your channel is absolutely amazing! red_heart How i can donate to support your work? party_popper

1,"@Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell. "" Please make a brief vedio on mental health disorders. Like OCD, Obsessive Compulsion, Stress, Anixiety, Overthinking, Repitative thoughts. And it's working in Physiological medical ways. And ways to reduce it."
1,I ate poo and now I've got coronky what do I do
1,"Omikron, pretty mush harmles in spred, and also alot less leathal
The virus gave us a favour with that variant"
1,One of the best descriptions I've seen of how it all works. Short and succinct; gets the point across. Well done!
1,The old refrigerants aren’t toxic in fact they are mostly inert. They were used in hair spray as a propellant. They are too inert and don’t break down in the atmosphere easily
1,"Wveey morning, or in cold day i always sneeze. My immune system cant fight them, they always lose for no reason!"
1,can the immune system makes a peace with invaders sometimes?
1,Lmao. Doesn't even talk about actual natural ways of boosting immune system. Just go straight for vaccines. And I would agree with you if vaccines weren't influenced by money. The best way to boost ur immune system is just by being healthy and getting a good amount of vitamin d.
2,explained so well it feels like a natural puzzle fitting in my understanding
1,does anyone even know how to pronounce Kurzgesagt
1,Anyone else notice the monkey holding the virus in the intro
1,so now in kurzgesagt store in Aliexpress full contry
1,Not first
0,Watching this while sick is something else
1,Isnt the Carbon footprint itself a product of BP or a other Oil Company?
1,I started watching this channel since when I was 7 love it keep it up
1,"Tells us how amazing it is, now tells us how dangerous it is. skull"
1,"Honestly, the biology-related episodes of Kurzgesagt are my favorites, especially when they specifically center around Microbiology and Cytology— Immune System videos, ones about specific bacteria or virus and what they do, so on and so forth."
1,"Will Kurzgesagt make a video showing how the increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has made the planet much greener? How about a video showing how the Sahara desert used to be lush and with more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere it could once again become a massive lush landscape.
How about a video showing how the economic policies trying to combat climate change aren't accomplishing anything at all besides killing poor people who are priced out of being able to survive. 
Where are those videos Kurzgesagt? The rising energy prices and food prices disproportionately affect the poor you proport to care about so much.
How about how the environmentalists think they need to keep the third world countries poor because if the third world countries enter the industrial age the environmentalists think the planet will burn.
How many millions have to be stepped on to try and meet the demands of the environmentalists? How about a video showing exactly how these policies are hurting people alive today in some moral crusade to save people who won't be born for a hundred years? And then how about mentioning how we have no evidence to show that these policies have had or will have any effect at all.

Be better."
1,"only *OG'S* remember the title is:
how to make your immune system stronger.."
1,Expecting comments filled with anti vax and Bill Gates conspiracy idoits
1,"Dear, Kurzgesagt, your usual ultra-high-quality is lacking a bit in this one.

Used a slightly obese woman in a health video. Look - I know it's more representative of the population of America, but please; we don't need to see that as healthy/normative. I will concede that it is possible I am reading into the 'art' given that the woman is wearing winter clothes which are typically baggy. 

Used the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine as an example - it is proven not to work as well or in the same way that the measles (amongst others) vaccine works."
1,"All this knowledge, and human still create anti-vac group. Bruh they should extinct instead of human who use their brain like us"
2,love all your videos but fuck this one with the vaccines.
1,My merch just arrived AND Kurzgesagt drops a video. This day cannot get better!
1,"I threw up 9 times on Saturday and starved for 3 days because I was unable to eat anything. I barely had enough energy to breathe. Thanks, body."
1,"Is it an unreasonable idea to say that novel treatments, based on novel technologies, could conceivably, possibly, carry long term risks that are not and can not be known until they have passed the test of time? Just hypothetically. I'm not talking about anything in particular. Is it?

If someone had asked the same thing about Thalidomide before its side effects were known, what would have been the most likely answer then?

Is it ethical to claim a higher degree of certainty about potentially life-altering questions than one actually possesses? Is it ethical to persecute people who ask uncomfortable questions?"
1,And when the vaccine producer starts mutating the viruses so that they can produce more vaccines? Then what?
1,"Why do vaccines let us get sick from the disease, fail to stop the spread, and cause bl00d cl0ts, yet the disease itself leaves 70% of hosts completely alone. Then those who are affected have a 99.93% chance of surviving?"
1, ...I recall hearing someplace elss that offsets *might* not be as good as thought... maybe a future video topic?
1,We watched this in my class
1,"I am pleased to have finally found a mistake in Kurzgesagt video. Between ""your"" and ""immune,"" there is an extra space astonished_faceface_with_crossed-out_eyes "
1,"SMoking is the eternal medical god did it.
If smoking truly hampered the immune system, it would treat autoimmune diseases.
Yet we are told it makes them worse.
So which statemnet is the lie? This one or the prior one?"
1,Imune system is the best way to defence an desie
1,"now do a video on how the covid jab doesn't qualify as an actual vaccine.
downvoted for pretending it is."
1,Interesting timing considering what is happening around wuhan... i like this channel and really hope this does not have political background.
1,"This is insane, Orwellian tier propaganda."
1,"This video I think would have prevented a lot of arguments and people from joining protests. It’s hard to refute the logic of getting vaccinated, even if you didn’t believe Covid was a risk or even real in the first place. Great video. I’m sharing it with every anti vaccine person I meet."
1,The thumbnail looks so similar to the coronavirus one
1,Good ol Bill and Melinda Gates promotion. Nothing quite like it. Thumbs down.
1,Three years late bud. We tried to tell them this. Lol I learned this stuff from monk.
2,"Hey Kurzgesagt! Mind if you make a video on tornadoes, they're super interesting and complex. Thanks so much, great content!"
1,"My name is Jacob meaning held by the heel. Get got if need be, proper.  Don't you hold me up. I get scrappy, okay?"
1,"Very cool! But carbon offsets are scams. Horribly under-regulated, a lot of them pay people to not cut down trees (that were never at any real risk of being cut down). Sometimes the trees are cut down later, anyway. In some cases, it's a money laundering scheme. When people *think* they can pay to be carbon neutral, they often stop making any real effort to cut down on their own emissions. Even worse when companies use carbon offsets to pretend to be carbon neutral."
1,"Define ""vaccine"". How do traditional vaccines like measles and polio differ from mRNA ""vaccines"" like covid?"
1,Is the Nature Dojo way more risky for young and healthy people?

2,"Yeah no, no vaccine for this man."
1,To all of the republicans in the US does this even make sense to any of you???
1,This Wren ad is already bs in my view the moment they ask you how much meat you eat. People that think that meat is bad for the environment should really watch the TED talk with Allan Savory regarding desertification. A balance diet of meant and veggies could bring back the forests we lost to desertification all over the world. I know Kgs is more pro vegan but I wish people would stop propagating the lie that meat is bad for the eviroment
1,"People: what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
*AIDS has entered the chat*"
1,i am still shocked by the fact i am not ded yet i mean i ate a food from a garbage can (somebody gave it to me) and i ate a food that has touched the ground and a cat has bit it
1,"what's BP's carbon footprint and why one me is not the one that needs to cut on carbon emissions before the people making ABSORBENT amounts of money by polluting? Yes, I am one of those that won't go first."
1,Sponsored by Pfizer mafia
1,"The most insidious facet of the ""natural immunity"" is that some viruses damage your immune system. So, yes, you might be prepared for that exact strain you got, but you're at higher risk for other viruses or even other strains of the same virus."
1,I had COVID 2 times and I survived it without a vaccine and this was the time when there was a vaccine smirking_face
1,Those who get Covid or other disease vaccine are all cheaters. I live with honor by always training my immune in my natural dojo.

1,You make it sound like vaccines have no negatives...

1,"Just wondering as I'm barely coming off this year's flu, does whey protein (like the one used for bodybuilding) help my body create the antibody proteins it so needs?"
1,"I'm starting to hate our language with the word ""vaccine"" being used to hide that MRNA is getting forced into kid's without research"
2,"So, you claim that vaccines are the best way to get a stronger immune system?  Good.  I was hoping you'd go there."
1, This is why so many people who got covid months ago still have respiratory problems
1,i use sanitizer/wash before every meal does this makes stronger or weaker
1,"Wait so, where’s the part where they tell you the best way to scientifically boost your immune system?"
1,Usually a huge fan of Kurzgesagt but this vaccine promo is a bit ridiculous. Huge difference between small pox vaccine and Covid inoculation which shouldn't be ignored or glossed over.

1,"Lets all be  honest, we learn more from steve (the kurzgesagt guy ) than from school"
1,"The video was splendid, however, it would be better if you guys have videos talking about Egypts."
1,"I know quite a few people who got vaccinated for Covid and got way sicker from the vaccine than I got from Covid. (Also, they found out natural immunity is more effective than the vaccine.) Heck, one local guy even died of blood clots within a week of the vaccine, so nope, not for me. I'll deal with natural immunity. 
And there ARE things other than the vaccine you can do for your body, like not smoking and eating healthy, as well as staying at a healthy weight and taking vitamins. (Note that the majority of the people who were younger and died of Covid were overweight or had low vitamin D.)"

1,"I don't think that your body will break down muscle if you have fat available. Reserved energy is what fat is, muscle is harder to break down and is only used as an energy resource in starvation circumstances. 
Less muscle after sickness would be due to the inactivity. Muscle atrophy happens faster than you would think."
1,i feel like you've made the same video so many times now. considering all the work that goes into the animation i would expect a wider range of topics.
2,I feel like the more you know about what is happening the better
1,Is this video going to be released in Portuguese? I'd like to use it in a vaccination campaign in Brazil. It 's a very instructive video anda I think it coud reach more people in our campaign
1,Thanks for my daily education Bill Gates
1,"You don't want to eat when you are sick because your body wants to go into autophagy, enhancing its ability to deal with invaders. The idea of ""starving a cold"" is valid as viruses are easier to deal with in this way since they are so small, and the infected cells they need to reproduce are an obvious target. But a fever is generally cause by bacterial infection, which will tend to take the form of a biofilm, which is more of a war of attrition. Need food over the long term to fight that. Hence ""feed a fever"".

But we know better than those stupid old people. Nine out of ten doctors agree that Lucky Strike is the healthiest cigarette. Best taken while pregnant with a nice racemic mixture of thalidomide."

1,"Oh boy, let me guess: This video came from certain people still thinking it's better to catch corona than get a vaccine?
Some people.. seriously.
 You hear that, vladimir? Your invasion of Ukraine is pointless, you will lose, now go back to bed!
 Called it. Another video for those vaccine sceptics out there.
 You see that over there, you vaccine sceptics? That mess at the end of the graph? That's you. That's you thinking you know better than science and stopping us from eradicating certain diseases because you think you will be fine without."
0,Why would people want to get sick to protect themselves from... Getting sick?

1,"I'm not sure how common this is but my mother and I have not fully recovered after contracting the omicron variant covid (I am fully vaccinated). Whenever I laugh even slightly I will almost always end up coughing, as if my throat cannot handle the sudden burst in inflow and outflow of air. It sucks :("
1,"Currently on the tail-end of a flu-like illness followed by a cold, miraculous that the symptoms dissipated within like 2 days"
1,It would be awesome if you would use less militaristic metaphores in your videos.
1,"Maybe a video on mRNA vaccines and why they need to be delivered more specifically and target specific cells (not in nano-bodies targeting every single cell of the body).

It is preposterous how this kind of vaccinations were just green-lighted without further investigations.

One can only hope that people take adverse mRNA vaccine effects seriously and stop just propagating booster shots.

Next thing we know you can get an mRNA vaccine for all the common diseases - just because it is so much easier and profitable to produce. Hooray!

At this rate a video of how the endless drive towards more riches is destroying sensible health care will be in order."
1,"i appreciate you telling me that vaccines boost my immune system but i already had a very acute awareness of this.  im not sure that id have watched this video if i knew the conclusion was just going to be ""vaccines boost your immune system""."
1,"Haha, seing this after I had debilitating, life threatening side effects from the new untested gene therapy masked as a vaccine, my critical thinking got ""vaccinated"" as well to be more informed in the future."
1,"Carbon offsets are often BS, be diligent in your verification. Natural reserves (in exchange for money) promise to keep their trees (duh, it's a reserve) and that purchase is thus technically a carbon offset. My promise (in return for money) to not cut down the tree in my back yard works too so much of these offsets is vapid mouthing of nonsense; get carefully informed before investing"
1,Good job on making this video now after that dumbass woody harleson spouting his anti vax rhetoric on SNL. Great job team keep it up and as always beautifully animated
2,perfect timing for this vid to come out haha i have bronchitis right now
1,I'm surprised I saw this within 3 hours.
1,When talking about the damage from infecitons... oh how do I fear that CoViD will still show to be worse than most ppl know.
1,Don't show this to anti-vaxxers
1,"Sure, let’s push a man-made vaccine instead of natural things like herd immunity (which worked quite well in countries that didn’t lock down)."
1,"what about the people who have scars on their organs now ,what can we do. i had a serious liver disease and my health is really bad from then, am i permanentlydamaged?"
1,Can yall please do a video on v2k technology and telepathy

2,It helps when the vaccine isn't potentially dangerous like the Covid vaccine.
2,"great video, thank you so much"
1,This is a dumb video you’re spreading BS. When you get sick with something unless it a virus like aids or Ebola your immune system always develops the antibodies to fight it in the future. It’s what people didn’t want to accept about Covid.

1,"idk about you guys but i think i am 100% one of those ''extreme immune response'' people. i very rarely get sick despite living in the country side and getting my hands dirty, and when i do get sick my body seems to take the nuclear option and just obliterates what ever was making me sick."
1,"This channel is forcing viruses, pathogens and vaccines in last two years so much that I'm starting to think that someone is paying to them to do so... thinking_face"
1,"One message is clear, build more muscles, they are not just for show."
1,Brought to you by Pfizer...
1,Did I just see a monkey eating a bacteria in the intro
1,You’ve helped me understand my body more than my 12 years of public education in America
1,Go work out. Never hurts to have some extra muscle around so your immune system can use it in a life or death situation
1,Me watching this with an infected piercing: skullmoaiskull
1, pff yeah covid was crazy. even though i got three vaccines when i caught covid it wiped me out for 2 weeks
1,Please get vaccinated against measles lol.
1,"Hi Gent good night I know it’s humiliating but it’s not even for me it’s for my son I haven’t eaten today
if someone needs a cleaning at home or in the yard in exchange for food would help
too much know it’s humiliating but I need this
aid"
1,I love how the monkey in the intro always holds a different thing in its hand that is related to the said video
1,Bought and paid for.
1,"With the references being made to recent events, this comes off more like a propaganada piece than informative. If you had left it as a general ""most of the time vaccines are pretty great"" without talking about covid, with the ....lackluster? performance that the vaccines that have been developed for it have had, this video would've been much more receivable.
I was hopeful for it because of the balanced approach  you've had to environment issues in the past, quite let down though."
1,This vid made me think about how bad my covid infection was considering i was sleeping 16h or more a day for 4 days straight. I wonder how bad it wouldve been if i wasnt 4x vaxxed.
1,Right now i had a small allergic reaction on a CATTEPILLAR BRO A SMAL THING MADE TORTURE
1,Let’s start an invasion and see what happens is a line taken straight from the US army
1,"Damn, I prefer the space existential crisis stuff over the Bill Gates propaganda stuff. I guess not every video can be good though"
2,Does eating extra when your sick help save more of your muscle from being used
1,"Wren? Ohh the site that said I can reduce my carbon footprint by going electric car  when I input 0 in my transportation. Yeah, right, I can reduce by increases. face_with_tears_of_joy"
1,What's the point of boosters if a vaccine already helped the immune system how to fight against the disease?
1,my mothers immune system attacked her eyes until she went blind. she had to start taking immune suppressants and it ended up killing her. covid plus immune suppressants equals death
1,Neutrophils as crazy chimps with machine guns is funny and nearly accurate
1,Funny they release this video while I'm currently sick. Lmao
1,"Yeah mine is actively trying to kill me, autoimmune diseases got me like... Wished we lived in a time where we could delete the ""memory"" of what to target from the Thymus"
1,an episode on muscle growth to stop all the bs abt it ?
1,would be beneficial to see this shown in grade schools and some universities.
1,I was impressed by your faux-LCD effect till I looked at the curve of the HUD and saw you cheated/parts of the curve occupied less than a pixel. For shame. Tsk tsk
1,Why didn't we mandate that obese people loose weight sing they were the biggest contributors to hospitalisation?thinking_face
2,"Thanks kurzgesagt, now I'm, not falling behind in biology thanks to you."
1,ok this is random but whos the music producer for your background music? lol
1,"too bad that co2 controls the oxygen levels, the less co2 the more oxygen."
1,do you know about mast cell activation and not how it was talked about in the book with all things resent
1,AHAHAH prefectly in short order after the company that created the covid vaccine get found out for mutating the covid virus to try and sell more new vaccines then propaganda machine 1 starts makikg a video shilling
1,"Fun fact: If your immune system knew your eyes existed, you'd go blind."
1,Today I had a test about this and I got 82 just from this video
2,cool
1,I’m the first
1,The love I have for the fascinating ways we learn about the fascinating world. And Kurzgesagt is one of them.
1,"I think next video you should explain about green energy with pros and contrast... You know like EV need a bateries, its just like u switching  from oil mining to nickel or bauxite"
2,Interesting.
1,another bill gates propaganda video nice
1,The endless variants of covid as caused by everyone having the same type of trained immunity from a mandated vaccine.  A mix of vaccine and natural immunity without vaccine would have been better for the population.
1,"I’ve been trying to get myself better. Not to weight yet just with what I eat. And I have noticed that I’ve gotten sick less and when I am it lasts shorter, a healthy diet really does help and it makes being sick a lot better. It’s still important not to forget that it’s ok to cheat once or twice every week or two you will be ok, it will help keep your spirits up and make the food on those days more enjoyable."
1,"Not interested in the covid vaccine in particular. I waited to see what it does to others around me, and as someone with heart issues, I don't want to take something that's been linked to heart attacks in young people. I haven't been sick outside of eating expired food, so if my confidence is going to be the death of me, so be it."
1,"Has Kurzgasagt considered making a video on the potential risks of vaccinating DURING a pandemic, vs vaccinating to prevent one? Basically a vaccinated population doesn't get a pandemic in the first place which is the whole point, but vaccinating during a pandemic instead risks exposing a pathogen to a large number of vaccinated hosts, while still retaining a large unvaccinated portion that can act as a reservoir. The result can vary but the risk is that the disease instead gets trained to infect vaccinated people since it's evolutionary environment has been changed.

I don't actually know what the conclusion should be, but I thought that was an interesting problem to try and tackle."
1,"As a kid always wished i could get over my illness faster, after i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and learnt that its literally your white blood cells killing your own cells from hyper-sensitivity, i now just trust my immune system to do its own thing."
2,Do you recommend any covid vax?
1, “you’re surrounded by enemies” literally any dictatorship face_with_tears_of_joy
1,"What bothers me is that multiple of my peers from high school treated me in a degrading and demeaning way when I said there was no point in me getting a vaccine. I was a part of the first wave in Wisconsin before media disseminated that Covid had arrived (yes, there will be lag between cases happening, cases being reported, and any media announcements). At the time, my household had two cashiers, so we were pretty well set up for early exposure. I had crippling fatigue and stayed in bed for two days and recovered quickly after... not exactly the panic button kind of threat mass media presented to me. Now I'm stuck as a cashier too, making three of us, and nobody in the house has come down with anything similar enough to suggest Omicron was threatening enough to be noticable. But despite all this, my peers tried to pressure me into getting a vaccine gat my body is already trained for, using some canned rhetoric about herd immunity to save the elderly. I even cited information provided by CDC and Kurzgesagt's videos to express how brazenly pointless and wasteful it would be in and of itself, completely ignoring the side topic of whether or not the young vaccine is safe and effective. Wow, because we can't just vax the elderly who stand less of a chance in nature's dojo... instead let's waste extra resources to try and accomplish the task in a moronically roundabout way. I'm hard-pressed to continue thinking of them as ""peers,"" especially the one going into the medical field who condemned me the most - how would he, of all of them, not know better? The frivolous antics of my fellow youngins are gonna give me a receding gray hairline well before my time."
1,"When I was 19 I nearly died from double-pneumonia - my organs were shutting down and I was dying without realizing it for 3 days, I thought I was just kinda sick. By the time I got to the hospital I was on deaths doorstep. Feeling your body burning itself for fuel from the inside out was awful, I lost 40 lbs over 2 days in the icu and couldn't move on my own for over a week. I had to be tubed to survive and I still have those scars over 10 years later.
This is my personal warning: Get vaccinated. Stay home if you feel sick. Go see a doctor before things get bad. Wear a mask to protect yourself and others if you or someone you know is ill. Please take care of yourself."
2,"What doesn't kill you, kills you slowly."
1,Personal carbon footprint is a bullshit pr move made to make customers believe theyre the ones affecting climate.
1,"It would also help a lot if our biolabs even in the us, weren't constantly leaking new diseases they developed."
1,"That’s all very well and good if the vaccines have not been rushed , properly trialled and proved safe and effective like in the past. The immune system is truly a wonderful thing."
1,My knowledge has expanded BBBBAAAAAAHHHHHH! Trying to do that Meme with a guy's mind exploding don't know his name but it might have come from a 90s or 80's show that I don't know about
1,"Video:

0,"And here I am once again with insomnia, now due to being ill. How ironic!"
1,"I love the series on the immune system! I am also very interested in the science of beneficial fungi on the human immune system, particularly Turkey Tail (Trametes Versicolor) which is considered an immune booster and even being trialed in cancer treatment therapies. Is this a topic that you would consider covering? Or anything else coming related to the third kingdom of life?"
1,I just kindly ask the pathogens to leave. Ever thought of that?
1,"""... nature dojo is just way more risky"" - I thought that the growing body of evidence for COVID points to the risks for the young and healthy actually being greater with vaccine dojo. I'm no antivaxer but it's looking more and more clear that we probably shouldn't have given the vaccine to the younguns (as long as they're 'healthy'). Interested to know your thoughts on this heart_hands"
1,"What doesn't kill you, will horribly maim you for the rest of your life"
1,"In the context of vaccination and nature immunity you put covid there to paint the picture of vaccines being better. Now, I think you need to make a separate video on that, sign the paper to make it clear that is your actual position regarding covid vaccination, and then issue an apology when the actual scientific process manages to fight through all the censorship and comes into mainstream disputing you. 
Making a statement on something that is still debated and presenting is as truth is dishonest at the very least and malicious at the worst. Majority of people trusted big pharma and vaccines before they arrived, however they proved really terrible with protecting people if not even dangerous in some cases - there is already good amount of data that shows how natural covid immunity might be superior, however the covid vaccine agenda (I hesitate to use that word for obvious reasons) seems to be way too strong. At the very least you should have left out the covid from this video. You chose to use it as example and that is very poor choice on such important video.
As someone who really likes this channel from pretty early on and someone who was always an avid fan of scientific process - it is big disappointment how you put that into this video. This is how trust in proper science is eroded and how actual anti-vax movement entered into mainstream. This is reason we will have outbreaks of measles and other diseases that used to be under control through vaccination."
1,"I personally would love a video going into the specifics of how exercise, sleep and healthy eating habits seem to exponentially benefit each others"
1,"Kurzgesagt, we admire your devotion, the only thing I dislike is the reason you make this kind of videos, only if people understood better, then this would seem more of an I formative video, rather than spreading awareness. Please continue your work, you have brought joy to me."
1,What happens when you take an  experimental gene therapy?
1,What is the DOOM Slayer of the immune system?
1,I still choose the Dwight Schrute bowl of vomit method.
1,"I understand on an individual level, but doesn't the ""nature dojo"" helps keep a healthy population ? Phasing out weaker immune system individuals from the gene pool ? Wouldnt it make the population more succeptible to genetic drift ?"
2,"Love the dojo analogy, graphics, and message!"
2,The animations are crispier. I like it.
1,"Wow, this video would really trigger the humble American people of twitter. I learnt something cool though."
0,"Masks are also amazing, but we’re abandoned in the culture for dumb reasons."
2,This channel made me the smartest kid in our class
1,"The statement in biology should be:
What doesn't kill you, mutates and tries again."
1,I love how this channel always follows my life events for inspiration.
1,"I recently just got sick and then this video came out, talk about timing"
1,But what happens with the virus or bacteria itself Eats up your Muscles
1,I love it when I was buff but I got sick and now I have a secondary larger bicep on the underside of my arm while also losing all my muscular mass.
1,"This is why it's better to eat foods that are already very broken down and easy to absorb when you're sick. Soup works great for this, as does congee."
1,Personal carbon footprints are a joke. Impact only comes at the corporate and governmental level. Why perpetuate a lie or half truth at best.
1,can you guys cover the train derailings and the effects of other things that are happening around the world right now that will affect our climate?
1,"This looks more like it was sponsored by pfizer...propaganda video, No mention of vitamine D ?  No mention of what recently emerged about the covid vaccines ?"
1,Not taking the mRNA gene therapy will help
1,"Kurzgesagt: think of yourself as a large country, with a sizeable army.  Me, an anarchist: ew no"
1,How much did Bill Gates pay you for this one Kurz?
1,Wow just when you think it's safe to watch a science education channel with wonderful information about how the body works they sneak in an ad from pharmaceutical companies about getting vaccinated against their will because they know what's better for you clearly the studies have come out and proved this is wrong. I would stick to doing fun animated science and stop towing the line of pharmaceutical companies that paid to force vaccinations on people which got them sicker weaker not immune to COVID any of the worst died. What a shame I'm so disappointed in you and I've been a fan for a very long time.
1,eat healthy and do sport ...
1,It's curious to watch this video when I feel so sick on bed
1,"I'm not vaccinated against covid, but I've had all of the normal childhood vaccines and have accepted tetanus shots at various points when it was suggested.  So, obviously, I'm not against vaccinations.  I've also never had a flu shot, and I haven't had the flu for about 28 years or so.  When I had to take public transit for about a year.  I don't practice fastidious hygene, (I'm a nail biter) and I'm not what people would probably define as ""healthy"".  Also, I had my tonsils removed as a child and one of them grew back.  Ever since it finished growing back I haven't been really sick from any viruses.  I don't get a flu or covid shot simply because of the lifestyle that I lead, but if ebola broke out, I would be getting a vaccine."
2,Sponsored by bill gates and his wealth
2,Wow this video is like 2 years too late!   lol
1,"Well I have EGPA, look that up and compare it to this video, could somebody please tell the immune system to tone it down a bit. My body is constantly fighting itself so when I get sick I really get sick, add high blood pressure and emphysema to that and you can pass out randomly just because you ate too much bacon the day before"
0,"hahahhahahha, what a nonsense overload, over and out !"
1,The comments look like bots.
1,I am like 12 years old so I like pretty young so I survived because I don't know why it's the blue your device I don't know.

1,"weird that a bill gates funded ""science"" channel is putting out propaganda attacking natural immunity, when bill gates is so heavily invested in vaccines. crazy."
1,"In afghanistan no one took a vacvine and everyone is find they also win against america,

Though I'm not sure you'll be getting any doners after it."
1,"A pro vaccine video right after the catastrophe of COVID-19 vaccines..... Anyone can understand that COVID was better left to the immune system rather than those jokes of ""vaccines"" Jesus smfh"
1,"In 2015, the channel received a US$570 thousand grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation[25]who would later become one of their key sponsors; Kurzgesagt have made videos calling for investment on novel technologies the foundation also supports, such as carbon capture and artificial meat, as well as arguing for an optimistic view on the future of climate change and economic inequality, a view shared by Bill Gates."

1,Owner of a body with MULTIPLE autoimmune diseases pensive_faceraised_back_of_hand thanks for educating people!
1,"My immune system has been turning on me bit by bit. First my tonsils when I was a little kid (had them removed, not an uncommon procedure at the time), then it tried to take my left eye on 3 different occasions (thank you steroid eye drops for saving me), and now it's going for my thyroid (nothing I can do, it's just going to be destroyed). This whole time I've been developing new allergies and intolerances to food and airborne particles, the list grows a little longer each year and I have to be more and more careful with what I eat. I catch every cold that goes around the block and sometimes have trouble shaking them off again. I've just reached my 20's. I'm healthy enough to still live a normal life, but it does make me nervous how the next few decades play out, if I'll even get to see old age or if I'll catch or develop a nasty disease before then."
1,"As someone with a child who has autoimmune encephalitis,  immune systems are fucking terrifying when they go rouge."
1,I'm still not taking the covid vaccine though
1,I would like to see a Kurzgesagt video comparing MRNA vs traditional vaccines.
2,Kurgesgat loves the immune system
1,"I love this channel, but how does YOUTUBE not put a COVID warning on this? There is clearly COVID information in this video."
1,This was in their book immune
1,"Incoming ""*insert political standing* made this video to put microchips in all of us! This is a government conspiracy video! Arghhh rabble rabble this video was made to silence our freedom of speech!"" comments from really really stupid people"
1,"Good reason why use vaccines.
Since vaccines are pretty safe and effective (according to provaxers having financial or other interests in vaccination) provaxers often use violent methods in order to force people to take 'the best things on the Earth' vaccines. Because vaccines are so good for you, that provaxers are happy to abuse or discriminate you, if you dont comply with them.
It clearly shows, that almost every provaxer is a copy of Jesus Christ, the Savior, who keep on making your life better (or worse, as many of us might feel).
They work hard to oppress you, to abuse your civilian rights, to restrict you and to gain profit, the more the better.

So, choose vaccinations, since dr mengele and his team were stopped at the end of WW2, now we need U to take part in our provax human experiment researches, hell yEah!"
1,Normal people like you and me put a fraction of CO2 in the air. Elites who fly their private planes and power their mansions put more toxic gasses in the air in one mont than we would in our entire lifetime.Wren is a scam.
1,"Oh, you dont want to get permanent damae on your organs after being ill? Just dont."
1,"I think we should all give ourselves AIDS, to protect ourselves from our immune systems.

Not you too guys..."
1,"You said humanity could potentially get rid of disease for good but that doesn't line up with the laws of nature observed. We NEED microbes like yeast to help plants grow and to make bread etc, bacteria is fundamentally tied to our life as gut microbiome and of course viruses are sneaky ""not-alive"" sets of protein which could be the only type of microbe I could see being abolished from ever infecting us."
1,When you realize the entire video is just leading up to a vaccine ad
1,"i loved your other two immune system videos and was all keyed up to enjoy this one.  …but, like most movie sequels these days, in the end, y'all chose to engage and end with the political sphere of vax vs. natural immunity, when there were just oh so many other directions and educations to be had.  so.  i just feel rather disappointed and sad, because ""the scientific"" can never be empirical if it's not nuanced and falsifiable.  :-("
1,After so many days human character in Kurzgesagt
1,Imagine actually believing that vaccines do better for your immune system than your own immune system. What a joke. This channel gets so many things wrong so often. It's not even funny. And people just eat it up like gospel
1,I personally would like to see this channel do a video on prion deases which are like misshaped protiens that once it is inside you you can't do anything about it.
1,Jesus christ what blatant propoganda. You getting sponsored by Pfizer or Moderna?
1,I’m on the spectrum. I can finally use that as an excuse.

1,Scars are not permanent there are drugs on development to make the body change the scar tissue into normal tissue they are on patenting right now for example verteporfin. Not only that but some parts of your body naturally recover completely unless under constant damage or stress like the liver.
1,Finally an immune system video.
1,"Alright lads, time to go into the comments and bully the anti-vaxxers."
1,but why. for the love of god. does the first thing my body do when i get sick is to block my flipping nose?? i can't breathe????
1,"Ngl this video was subpar, you only get the 1 answer in the last 2 minutes where it also includes a climate rant and ads. The 1 answers being taking vaccines... not very impressed"
1,I caught a very bad Influenza and have over 39.5C Fever since Friday. I am lucky that my Doctor still does Home Treatment in some cases. This video just released in the perfect time for me.
1,You think I don't know what your upto
2,"I love these videos, they help me relax after a long day"
1,Vaccines are good but these Covid treatment drugs are NOT traditional vaccines. They are a brand new technology and you all are the lab rats.
2,Amazing & Interesting video. Would love more videos about the nerve system!
1,Something is just really addicting about this channel and i don't even know why..
1,“There’s this idea floating around that what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” is the best opening I have heard in long time.
1,How much of my will can be reflected in my fate?
1,"Offset your carbon footprint while Bill Gates flying his private planes and each flight is equal to someone elses lifetime of using a car, seems like a legit ad"
1,"The vaccine vs. nature analogy is a good one, but it has me wondering what would be an apt analogy for the covid vaccines. It's like the nature one, only everyone in the dojo is jacked up on roids?

Edit: It is a little concerning how the video tends to conflate vaccines (of the typical variety) with covid vaccines. It never directly says they are one and the same, but it could easily be interpreted that way. It also seems to equate life-threatening illnesses with the common cold. A lot of young people became fearful of every little symptom since covid, and that is no way to live."
1,talk about something else!
1,"you are full of bullshit guys, how much have you been paid to say that vaccine immunity is  better and stronger than natural immunity? money talks."
1,"""Your Immune System is a Jerk.""

We need this on a shirt."
1,Doesn't that mean though that getting a vaccine prematurely (before it is very prevelant) would be worse off for you because those machine gun chimps would go around and blast the wrong stuff? Wondering how beneficial being GigaVaxxed vs Unvaccinated would be in a average industrialised country working at an office job.
1,"Could u guys make a video on bio hacking methods like cold water exposure/the win hof method and explain how they benefit/don’t benefit ur immune system and if they are worth putting time into?

Thanks-love ur channel!!"
1,"""all that muscles you worked so hard for is sacrified to keep you alive""
I am actually speechless, cause by few months I gained muscles as never before.
I always got very sick everytime but this time.. I just lost muscle mass!!
If it wasnt for this video I would never have guessed so easily.
Now I understand.
Now I have POWER.
No, really, this is a revolution. For me at least is something I always struggled: always sick, always without muscles.
No wonder nobody says it.. it would immediately drop any medicine sale"
1,Why cells have faces?
2, What kind of chicanery is this!?!?!
1,Amazing video Kurzgesagt and i love your content so much :]
1,These guys sold out to wef. RIP
1,"Love you guys for your hard work.
It feels like your there not only to gain money but because you want to be.
You seem pationate and devoted to the things you do and increase the quality of your videos for better understanding. In other words feels like you think of us not as the leading money source but more as a class to teach. Im also impressed by the fact you guys talk about important matters such as climate change and more to motivate ppl to actively participate using your entertaining videos. Not only are you researchers, you are also teachers playing the roll of parents somehow. Keep up the excellent work and thank you for the plendid videos containing fascinating information."
1,if you can't handle nature that's a literal skill issue maybe consider quitting the game let a better player have your place in the lobby
1,The Immune book was the most interesting book about biology I've ever read
1,"Oh, I found this out in person over the last few days. I ended up bruising a certain part of my body that resulted in constipation for the last week, which made my body freak out like I had a stomach flu."
1,So basically the immune system can be a double-edge sword.
1,"""But the vaccine against Covid 19 wasn't tested enough before being put on the field.""

No, I'm not against or pro the vaccine, each one does what believes is best for him/herself.
And I'm also not interested in mindless discussions, so don't answer with hate, ok?

**I wanna know more opinions, more angles of this.**

Usually a vaccine is tested for years, so when the population get vaccinated, the side effects are mostly well known.

This was impossible with Covid 19 because of time, needs and other alarming numbers.

Then 1 shoot became 3 or 4 and we still don't know much about side effects.

Is this a clear vision of the situation? What do you think?"
1,vaccines? My classmate developed cancer after vaccination....
1,"this video doesn't say everything... this is the first time I am a little bit disappointed by a kurzgegat video...

Something they don't say to you (don't be stupid, if they talk about it, it relates to anti COVID vaccines people) :
there's a language spoken by organic life : DNA
this DNA is built of essential acids constituting nucleotids : A T G C
The more you have basis peers (a group of 2 nucleotids), the more the cell is LIKELY to code a lot of information

The more DNA a cell has (a virus for example), the more it is heavy and non spreadable by air for example
SO, whatever you would say about COVID, it CANNOT be a dangerous disease as the maximum effectiveness of an infection and its virality/violence is limited to the weight of your DNA
As COVID is light, it spreads fast, but cannot do much things on your body, QED

We have built the most dangerous virus ever possible, and that result saying that the dangerousness of a organic cell is limited by its' weight is true, there's no doubt about that, military chemical industry has proven it
So stop being affraid of life : if you're young, you're taking more risk at this ""vaccin dojo"" than in the ""nature dojo"" if you're in good health, this is a fact...

1,"I usually love your content, but peddling carbon footprint is bullshit. a campaign started by oil company BP to distract from their recent fuckup. a oil spill. As youve stated previously in atleast two videos, the individual doesnt have an affect. To put pressure on a vast audience of 5million + to help ""balance"" their footprint is bullshit when the campaign was just a distraction tactic in the first place. The only real effect we can have on the climate is by writing to our local government to put pressure on green bills and pressure on dirty (in terms of green house gas production) corporations to just stop.

Please get better sponsors before peddling corporate propaganda distracting us from the real issues"
2,I'm just here to laugh at the antivax folx

and that mean our body have a system to replace collagen by true cells later?"

0,I'm suffering from cold at the moment
1,"Book rec for y'all: ""The Song of the Cell"" by Siddhartha Mukherjee gives an excellent high level overview of cellular therapies in medicine, from IVF to cancer treatments to even curing HIV. Our immune systems are complex but Mukherjee gives a great overview of T cells and B cells and the like. I think this audience would enjoy it!"
1,"Wasn't this video titled ""You are an impossible machine"" before? Why did you remove that video?"
1,"The title is misleading: vaccines don't boost the immune system, it merely trains it

One time I was super stressed out at work and spent two days without eating and sleeping. Consequently I almost literally died from an infection of run-of-the-mill streptococcus (strep throat). Because my immune system was depressed and no vaccine would have changed that."

1,"People wonder why their familiars are dropping dead constantly especially in developed countries like US well weak immune system and bad genetics is the answer due to lack of exposed to nature because let's face it living in nature has so much more benefits than leaving in developed areas and hearts, lungs and brains will agree"
1,Please do a video over blood. Blood types especially
0,This entire video is just vaccine propaganda. Sad Kurzgeasgt fell this low.
1,"I swear to god, you guys are somehow monitoring me secretly, I am currently reading the Immune book by philip dettmer and the videos that Kurzgesagt releases exactly when I am on the same topic page that needs explaining. Even the previous video regarding proteins was like that. How you doing it?"
1,Did they change the title
1,I can already see the conspiracy comments.
1,"I asked ChatGPT what its favorite channel is, and now I'm here."

1,So neutrophils are Jimmy McGill!!
1,"What % of Kurzgesagt's funding comes from companies with investments in vaccine manufacturing? You received millions from foundations which also fund vaccines, yes? Such as Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation."
1, as a hearts of iron 4 player i can comfirm this is true
1,"The best way to boost your immune system: Eat a balanced nutritious diet with plenty of vitamins and minerals; get adequate sleep every day; get adequate weekly exercise; avoid drink, smoking, fast food, and processed sugar like the plague. The fact that not one thing from this list made it into a video about boosting immunity should prompt questions as to this channel's interests in making this video. This is particularly pertinent after that propaganda allegation by the channel named ""The Hated One"" about how Kurzgesagt was receiving funding from parties interested in vaccine profiteering like the Gates Foundation."
2,Nice video heart_suit

1,"I used to know a guy who brought up the “what doesn’t kill your” line a lot. Even had a little inspirational poster of it on his door. 
Didn’t like it when I asked if cutting off his arm would make him stronger."
1,"Hell yeah we're back talking about the immune system. By the way Kurzgesagt don't listen to those doomers who want to whine and complain about the optimism you expressed in your recent climate change videos and about the videos that are sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Those doomers are doing exactly what the huge corporations they claim to hate so much want them to do by being pessimistic and cynical about anyone even trying to be cautiously optimistic about slowing and reversing climate change. And as for Bill and Melinda Gates, as far as billionaires go, Bill Gates is among the billionaires we can be least antagonistic towards. I'll just leave off with this, again regarding the climate change doomsayers: 

""Some people who are particularly up their own asses think that the only way to fix climate change is to abolish capitalism. This is clearly not feasible. If your climate change solution is to completely dismantle and rebuild the entire economic system of nearly every country on the planet within a decade, you are not serious about climate change."""
1,I wonder how much Phizer paid to have this video made.
1,"""crazy aggressive chimps with machine guns"", Americans?"
1,you should make a video on how to make a nuclear bomb in a nutshell
1,F*ck yea another cool ass video from the channel whose name I can’t pronounce face_with_tears_of_joy
1,"I like it when the among us cells go ""amogus""."
1,"*Damn! Yal really are getting exposed, smh you know money always corrupts things. I loved yal videos but when i saw that overpopulation & Africa video, my antennas went up. Shame on you*"
1,Immune system is like an army. Like in some countries it imposes martial law and harm the country itself likewise in some individuals immune system causes autoimmune disease and starts to harm the body itself
1,Need to start hoarding those BCAA and EAA sports nutritions in case of influenza.
1,"I literally just got to this part in the Immune Book.

It’s really great companion to the video and I highly suggest you read it if you have it. It’s broken in sections that takes like 5 minutes tops.

For example, I learned that Measles attacks your immune memory cells so you can actually LOSE your immunity to certain diseases. Which is why it’s so important that we vaccinate against it and eradicate it.

I hope they do a video on that one day.

EDIT: Apparently measles was covered 8 years ago!"
1,This just comes off as an ad for big pharma….
1,Awesome explanation
1,"Honestly, seems to me like this immune system thing needs a software update face_with_tears_of_joy"
1,"Oh wow misinformation never expected you guys to get it wrong, also so much BS video was commissioned by Pfizer."
1," Personal carbon footprint is nonsense, made to distract people from the real villains. If billionairs and cooporations were to stop their private flights and private parties, they can start talking about environmental and social issues."

1,"Like a Doctor I'm just wanna say, this video is amazing"
2,I love these kinds of immune system animations!
1,This is just absolutely bunk and I'm actually quite disappointed you would propagate such a lie. Almost every study ever done has pretty concrete evidence that natural immunity is far better than vaccines. Why would you ignore the research? This is unusual for this channel. Quite disappointed.
1,i learned all this in better detail watching the cells at work and cells at work code black anime series.
1,Pfizer and moderna liked this very muchred_heart
1,Such an amazing visual and descriptive video as always! I truly get so excited when a new video drops from you guys knowing it's information that can be life changing. Literally in this case!
2,"Just slapping in a comment for the algorithm :)
Another great video as usual. Love the biology ones most."
1,y’all work for major corporations that fund lobbyists in congress omg somebody get him
2,Thank you for making such a lovely video on this topic! I hope at least one anti-vaxxer changes their mind
1,"currently reading a lot about health, desease prevention. Eathing healthy, avoiding toxins, some kind of exercise - sport and reducing stress are also crucial for having a strong immune system. Also the role of antioxidants and having enough of them to be able to fight oxidative stress and radicals."
1," Is that really true? I have always thought that actually going through the sickness gives you better weapons, since your immune system had to face the real thing."
1,If fever is protection why do doctors prescribe meds to control fever?

0,"As someone with chronic autoimmune illness, no, it is not more dangerous than I think. I know exactly how dangerous it is."
1,"as my Guru self help Singh said: ""But what doesn't kill you is putting you on the chronic stress medication"""
1,"My immune system is suppressed by two medications as it's attacking my joints, can confirm immune system is very potent"
1,"Funny how pre covid you guys made videos about how strong and powerful our immune system is, using things like T cells and other parts to remember a threat to better combat it. Now ever since people started using natural immunity as a reason to not get the covid jab, suddenly videos are coming out saying not to rely on the immune system. Hmm smells like corruption and who influence"
1,"Another important thing: All the resources needed to activate the immune system, some of them are stored in limited amounts in the body.

Just like Japan in WWII was hobbled seriously when the Allies cut off their supply convoys, if these resources required by the immune system activation is not replenished, your immune system will be capped.

Vitamins (especially C and D) and Magnesium (to activate Vitamin D) are among those very important resources. Deficiency in them usually results in a much weaker immune system."
1,"In Brazil, parents are trying to take their kids to polio's nature dojo. For the past years, vaccination rates have been sadly falling and with them increasing the risk we can see a previously extinguished disease ressurge in our country. Hope initiatives like this help everyone understand the importance of following vaccination guidelines."
1, is a bit... it's quite a stretch to put it mildly.
1,no no no. my body is definitely good without vacines. this is much better than trying humans mistakes on myself.
1,Could you do some research on carbon offsetting for us?
1,He's right. I had pneumonia above 7 times before reaching adulthood. My resting v02 max is 96. I workout a lot which helps but my lungs are as scared as a casual smoker.

Brush your teeth and floss.

Eat blueberries and drink green tea."
1,Lezz goo another immune system study
2,"Wow, this has double brilliance"
1,"I have a rare autoimmune disease called Guillan Barre syndrome that made my immune system attack my nerves and completely paralyzed me. It started in my feet and the paralysis slowly worked its way up to my head and by then it nearly killed because I couldn't breath let alone eat, or drink (had a near death experience that was beyond vivid but that's a tale for another time.) But after I rose from a medically induced coma they had me on a treatment like chemo except instead targeting rogue mutated cancer cells it's targeting my rogue immune system. This was in 2013 I was 16 then now 26 and I've gotten better with taking immune boosters and such to build it up but it's scary how my own body turned against me. It turned me into living like a plant for months where I was alive but couldn't move. 
I mentioned in an anthropology class I have when we discussed medical anthropology how there's a new treatment in the works that will allow the immune system to be aware of cancer cells and to armed them to attack it. As great as that sounds it does sound scary to also let the immune system go berserk like that."
1,"I Bought your book about immune system, it  was interesting and surprising!! red_heartred_heart"
1,"Fantastically friendly and clear as always! There is so much misinformation about vaccines- or people getting drawn into sketchy conspiracy theories. These videos are a brilliant tool to educate people in a way that unpacks serious ideas in a very accessible way. I actually shared your last vaccines video with friends who had been fed misinformation- when what they really needed was a clear, approachable look at what vaccines really are (and are not!). This approach is a winner- and similarly with climate change. Enlightening, clear and non political."
1,"You really only touched on vaccines to boost immunity, yet left having a good diet and being active out."
1,"A well-deserved dislike for covid injections propaganda. You could have chosen an example of any other vaccine that works far better and is far less controversial. Instead, you chose these particular ones, which a recent (I think) lancet paper shows are not better than natural immunity in terms of protection, and which do have a considerable range of acknowledged side effects that according to some governmental health agencies are too high for certain demographic groups. And who knows how much more there is given the lack of freedom of debate and information in the current extremely politically biased environment?
In fact, even if the censorship etc were removed, how to be sure that all long-term side effects are properly captured? My allergy have worsened a lot after one vaccine that is not usually made to general public. Could this be related? Judging by some titles found it google scholar, it could. But how is this monitored? Nobody checked on me, that's for sure. And on two other people with similar experiences that I know. In my case, it actually took me years before I realised that the condition I started having from time to time is allergy (well, I did have it before, but it was so mild, that I did not really care what it is)."

1,"This video is very important. Not only about the usefulness of vaccines, but the understanding that once our body gets sick, there are impacts to our organs that can sometimes be permanent. I think lots of folks believe getting sick is a great way to train our bodies to become stronger, but repeated impacts to our organs from getting sick can lead to long-term negative impacts (like scars) to our organs, meaning they can no longer function at peak level. Virus and bacterias' ability to damage our organs and its compound effect is scary. The priority goal of any illness should be prevention, not treatment."
1,"Sponsored video from Pfizer?
I'm not even antivax, but we see the excess mortality all over the world starting not in March 2020 but in 2021 EXACTLY when the first vaccines were made public. There is a reason vaccines have been tested for a decade and not for 2 months. Also, before c19 it was common knowledge to never vax INTO an ongoing epidemic. Still, we did. This video is a punch in the face for everyone with vaccine related damages, pretending like they don't exist."
1,"Kurzgesagt - I freakin' love you guys! For that reason, I implore you guys to look into the economics of carbon offsets. Please! You guys are science-driven! Good! So look into the science of carbon offsets and whether or not they actually work.

But since then, I've been exposed to covid multiple times and never got it. It's interesting how I have an insanely massive response to the vaccine but none at all to exposure to the actual virus.

1,does this also correspond with allergies from pollen?
1,This is legit propaganda look who sponsors this channel (bill gates fundation) and guess who makes a lot of vacines exactly this is such a rabbit hole you can search more onto this topic on yt about how this channel spreads misinformation or just some information that the donors want

1,"Excessive sugar consumption will impair your immune system too. Personally, I eat added sugars below the currend moderation levels nad have been ill way less often since then. Diet is important! Perhaps even moderate drinking can have an impact on your immune system. Just google it. 

You cannot vaccinate yourself against common colds, but you can always develop good habits."

1,"Covid-19 vaccines do not generally follow what was shown here, as attempts to go down that path failed early on. That's why it took so long to get a vaccine, they were coming up with creative new ways to teach the immune system. Every other vaccine generally does follow what was shown. Also, any immunologist claiming a vaccine is better than getting and surviving something naturally is doing so because the vaccine route avoids damage, downtime and possible death, not because it produces superior immunity, vaccines gives good immunity, but nothing gives better immunity than surviving an actual encounter. Vaccines are still the better option of the two because they're much safer (as mentioned in the video)"

1,"Kurzgesat: Vaccines help prevent disease.
The common cold: Bring it on!!!!!"
1,"I would have loved you including another thing in this video as it's one of my own persistent doubts. I know people that take Ibuprofen or paracetamol immediately after having a slight increase in body temperature or they feel a little sick and they take antiinflammatory medicine, supposedly, to prevent any disease. But I, on the other hand, kinda have the thinking that was criticized in this video and I only take medicine when I am really bad, like 38 or more degrees fever or real bad pain. I always wondered who is right, and I certainly will accept any information from commentators. Thanks."
1,"I have so many scars on my skin
Now I'm scared"
1,"I get the feeling that a member of the Kurzgesagt team happened on a Yahoo! News article's comment section. It doesn't matter what the news article is about, it never matters, the comment section of every Yahoo! News article's comment section is a cesspit of the dumbest people in the world deciding to voice their opinions, and every article will have at least one person making this claim: ""Back in my day, we let kids play outside in the mud and in filthy pond water. Children NEVER got sick in my day, but now when kids are so sheltered and homes are so clean, no one is getting access to good germs they need to keep their immune system strong, so now everyone is getting sick more often! Kids need to play in the mud, drink pond water, and be in filthy conditions so their immune systems become strong!""

I think someone got sick of seeing that old argument for the 1000th time, and decided to make this Kurzgesagt video to explain in great detail just how dumb that is, and how wrong a lot of the assumptions that go into that old argument are."

1,"I just know what it feels like when you imune system constantly ""overreacts"". I really love my allergies. In a way they also make you weaker because you are constantly fighting something that isn't even worth fighting.
Makes me feel like ive been run over by a car sometimes, im lucky that i rarely experience days like that, plus thers enough stuff nowadays that you can take to prevent it, if it gets real bad."
0,Watching this while being sick is actually really cool
1,there's a point of negative returns
1,"The end though...

1,So what happens if you intermittent fast while being sick? Then your body won’t have those calories to reproduce immune cells?
1,"I'm watching this with the first flu I've had in years, and the worst one I've ever had at that."
1,Looks like Jesus pick the right defense for us thank you Jesus folded_handsamenfolded_hands
1,nice to see a video by you guys that isn't oozing with billionaire propaganda
1,"Eradicating all infectious disease is a virtually impossible task and what you would be forced to do to achieve it scares me. You want to substitute the second most complex system in the body with an eternal genocidal war on some of nature's most successful and prolific life forms? How about you instead go to another planet and sanitize all immigrants, you can have your dystopia over there instead and it will be infinitely easier to establish than making it here. On Earth I'd much rather we focus on learning how to regenerate our cells."
1,I've just read your book 'immune' and honestly there isn't single book out there in the market where you can find such simple elaboration of such complex immune system I really enjoyed it.
2,In a nutshell: prevention is better than cure!
1,"Definitely need an asterisk at the vaccine bit. This applies only BEFORE ""they"" changed the definition of vaccine. You know, when they actually worked and granted full immunity, like vaccines should? And did? And then the afterword about climate change... yikes. Propaganda even in my animated ""educational"" videos. Damn."
1,"avoid SARS-2 Covid, yo … repeat infections too"
1,"I don't know why it makes me emotional. The thought that your body ""covers your back"", just having this great ally."
1,This just makes me want to re read their glorious book again!
1,why do i feel more active then
0,watching this when i am sick is weird
1,Ah another immune system video. I'm a big fan of this series
1,I have a slightly different take on the nature vs vaccine. It has just come out (study in 65 countries)that those people who have COVID immunity due to the vaccine only are protected about 36% (vaccine)vs 74% (nature) more effectively that those who are naturally infected with COVID who have longer immunity and for a longer period of time. Still vaccines are lifesaving and they are a very strong weapon against infections.
1,"Stupid video, the coronavirus vaccine was the worst vaccine in human history, rushed to the market with not enough tests and it gave me chronic migraine and myocarditis i got 3 friggin vaccines and the worst part is that on december of 2022 i got COVID it's so stupid that almost killed me too, it's not worth it."
1,"This channel just became a disgusting propaganda mouthpiece for bill gates and other ""investors"", I really hope people don't actually take you seriously anymore"
1,"And here I am thinking you were to talk about breathing, either it be Wim Hoff's method or similar... 
You could have at least included it, but just concentrated on vaccines... 
Sure you are not biased?"
1,I wish you had gone into more depth about the difference between traditional vaccines and the new MRNA vaccines. They do not operate in the way you are illustrating in this video.
1,"Why do we lose appetite? Isnt that our main energy source? Yes it takes time to digest it, but what else can we do to get energy? Skinny people especially lol"
1,"Vaccines are good, especially if it's Pfizer MRNA Vaccine. It's your immune system that is to blame if you die."

1,"About a year ago I bought your book about the immune system and I found it really fascinating. I wondered if you would ever make a video about it since in my opinion it's something everyone should know about. I love the way you explained it, it makes it easy to understand and truly entertaining. Your channel is really great, I've learned a lot from you and I'm always looking forward to the next video. Keep going just like this flexed_biceps"
1,Nice vaccine propaganda. My friend at work said that his kid got autism cause once he vaccinated him and then he wouldn't eat like had used to for a couple of days so I know my sources are trusted.

1,"There was some false information here.  He guessed that vaccines do a better job at making one immune to diseases than the actual disease.  According to scientists that I know that isn't actually true.  However, I would rather get the polio vaccine rather than polio, Measles vaccine rather than Measles, and there are other examples.   The complications for these diseases are common and horrific, if you get the disease, compared to the tried and tested vaccine.  The Covid vaxes, no the other hand, are proving to be more dangerous than the disease itself, as evidenced by the increase death rate reported by life insurance companies."

I'm sorry that you've been influenced too much by the modern consumerism and finally managed to destroy a place I really used to enjoy myself with thousands of my students. You have now become the very thing you were preaching to avoid. You had a responsibility, which now have chosen to avoid in order to accumulate as many gains as you can, and shame on you for serving the obvious evil forces around us. I guess it's all on me for having any expectations of anyone, whos fathers and grandfathers used to kill defenceless people (women and kids included) by the thousands, you accursed NAZIS. Don't ever touch science again, all your contribution is gained by your IDOL with the fancy moustache, which all of you would follow nowadays!

2,Pfizer smiles at this video.
1,"I trained my body in the vaccine dojo against covid and still got my butt handed to me by it. I think my sensei was BSing me on his training abilities. Apparently most vaccine dojo senseis train for a decade before passing their skills on. I learned that mine barely trained for a year, and his training method wasn't even traditional martial arts, it was something new he'd just come up with."
1," ""In vaccine dojo you get no scars no pernament damage"" yeah well tell that to everyone who died of a hearth attack a day or two after beeing vaccinated and to all the african children who died to experimental Bill&melinda gates vaccines years before covid.
Just for context,I am no anti vaxer,I believe vaccines as a technology have been proven to work,we eradicated many diseases like polio and small pox and the method of introducing a more inert/less dangerous strain of a virus in order to prepare you for the real thing is exactly how vaccines work(and even so the debate in the scientific community wether the long terms global health effects of vaccines could potentialy leave us more vulnerable in the distant future,leading to creating of super viruses and potentialy back firing in a biblical way,that debate is still very much ongoing).
I have been a long time kurzgesagt subsriber and normaly I love the videos,like them,share them with friends and generally recomend the channel.
So I am genuinly disapointed to thumb this video down for beeing a very one sided,FACT BENDING PROPAGANDA.
You talk about ways to train your immune system and mention absolutely noting about cold exposure,sunlight intake or how hiking in the mountain is proven to boost your immune system.
You also mention noting about how if someone is living in a buble(beeing locked down)their immune system begins to weaken and when that someone steps outside of the buble they lived in,suddenly they are much more vulnerable and likely to get infected(just look at china now)
Instead you make a video trying to convince people that our immune systems are dangerous apes running out of controll trying to kill us and the only safe,rational approach is to double down of vaccines and weaken those deadly apes.
Cool theory bro.
Here is my theory,our immune system isnt perfect,but it's what kept us alive for litteraly hundreds of thousands of years.
You,yes you reading this,are the result of milions of years of evolution,countless trials and errors,untill you emerged.
Sure your immune system may fuck up,sure it may even kill you.
But when shit comes to shove,I sure as hell trust my immune system to watch my back and work for my interest than I trust phizer,moderna,WHO,military/vaccines industrial  complex to do the task.
Vaccines as a technology are a powerfull tool,a tool that can be used for good or it can be used for evil,it's up to the user(a naive person believes it's used for either good or evil,people with actuall knowedge in the field know it's  been used for both).
Anyone trying to convince you that your body is your own worst enemy and you need to be constantly vaccinated,chiped,monitored and nurtured by the medical industrial complex in order to be healthy,is not your friend and you should know better."
1,"It so hard to find a detailed explanation in regards to medical health and there are some, but they explained it more generally not like this. You fam deserved a sub and a like."

1,Does the monkey in the intro have a name? They are cool
1,You can train your system by eating dirt B)
1,"Should not include the treatment of Covid in a thing about vaccines. First there is the difference between a vaccination and an inoculation which the latter is what the attempted treatment of Covid was. The word vaccine is used so often now to mean things that it is not that they actually changed the meaning, which really defeats the purpose. A vaccine is like getting a wound stitched up, it'll heal faster and won't be too much of an issue in the future; an inoculation is like putting a band-aid on a wound, sure it's not bleeding rn but it can still easily be an issue later.
Added the system for the corona virus is under fire from multiple countries because even stronger evidence shows that it just caused issues and did not actually do what it was marketed to do in the slightest."

0,"My immune system attacked and killed my kidneys, now I'm on dialysis to stay alive."
1,"My god did Kurzgesagt take a fall, shouldn’t have posted the video on Bill Gates foundation cause now I believe it. Where was the part of the video talking about how if you’re vaccinated for flu A and get Flu B you will end up being more sick than if you did nothing? I’ve literally seen every video they’ve ever done but now are pushing the vaccine agenda. For anyone who reads this and gets angry, I’m not against vaccines, but if you are a learning channel shouldn’t the viewers be told everything and not that they are solely positive? Such a shame to see."
1,wouldnt take a untested vaccine with an entirely untested function (spike proteins) so id not take the one that is obviously advertised here
1,PAID PROPAGANDA FROM BIG PHARMACY! thumbs_downthumbs_downthumbs_down
1,"I'm very sad Kurzgesagt is promoting carbon offsets. This is a bad way to tackle the issue for many reasons. 1. because it's not the first step to take, it's the LAST (before, in order: reduce, reuse, recycle). 2. because the promise of planting some random trees on some random part of the world is very often unefficient, the impact impossible to prove, and not handled properly. Companies will sub-contract to sub-contractors sub-contracting, and nothing gets verified or handled properly. There's many cases where trees planted are mono-culture, the wrong one for the area, or where ""protected"" parcels were never in any danger of anything. And the ratio money spent / carbon offset is ridiculous. Not to mention a tree needs about 5 - 10 years to start offsetting anything of interest, and we can't wait that long 3. this lets people to believe they can still continue to polute as much as they want: it's ok, they ""offset"" their emissions.

Please Kurzgesagt, do better research on your ads, just like you do on your topics."

1,"Thank you for your brilliant videos. I appreciate them, they are wonderful, so well researched, fun to watch, and super helpful. I’m wondering though, why are you think your viewers need continuous, irritating, music competing with the speaker. I can understand playing very subtle, quiet, background music that might make people more receptive to hearing what you’re saying. But I have found in many TV shows the same tendency towards music every second, and here we have music during the narration. My request is that you drop the music. Thank you so much.red_heart"
1,"Many biases in this video:
1. One size fits all. Giving the same dose of vaccine to all
2. More than 90% of people who gets covid are asymptomatic or mild, so it s wrong to say one gets more damage due to natural immunity.
3. It is wrong to sideline the many lives lost or loss of life quality due to vaccines by myocarditis, blood clots, bells palsy, and others"

1,What happened between 1988 and 2007?

1,"Can I point out that Kurzgesagt has worked closely with the Bill and Malinda Gates Foundation and that Bill Gates made over $200 million on vaccines over the pandemic.. I usually enjoy Kurzgesagt content and find it both educating and enjoyable, please stick to the other content and quit sharing vaccine propaganda."
1,Is that actually true that vaccines give you better immunity than the natural disease. Because when you actually get the disease your body perfectly knows what it is. Where as a vaccine is more so like a cousin or dead version of the enemy. If anyone has answers please tell me thanks.
1,great its another episode in Kurzgesagt/Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation propaganda

1,"To an extend, this is pro big pharma propaganda. It's not bad necessarily but when you look at the current scandals with Pfizer vs project veritas for example and the horrible coverup the untested vaccines have received from the media, as well as the act of forcefully mutating the virus for unspecified reasons, it really starts to look like more and more of these videos are just propaganda with a liberal bias."

1,Again with the propaganda and not putting your sponsor at the beginning.
1,You heard that antivaxxers? Vaccines don't cause autism
1,All fun and dandy until the climate change indoctrination
1," I work with appliances and while the refrigerant put inside those fridges may harm the atmosphere, 1. they shouldn't be finding their way into the atmosphere and 2. the damage they cause is very overexaggerated. Just because it can be harmful doesn't mean that it's currently harming the atmosphere whenever you are putting it into (hopefully) a fridge with a sealed system where it is being cycled through. 

The reason why we hear a lot about this is because the refrigerant industry is using it as a reason to replace all of the old fridges or force people to buy a newer, more expensive version of the refrigerant. This is because it was just getting too cheap for someone to be able to replace their fridge's coolant. Well, you may ask why does that matter?

I have seen the results first hand. Customers would come to the store and whenever we told them the price of their coolant they just said to forget about it, that they'd just buy a new fridge. If we did end up replacing it, they often had some other problem not too long after we got done replacing it. Now, this could be because the fridge is old but it could also mean maybe the new coolant isn't playing nice with the fridge as well. Either way, the company wins. They either sell very expensive trashy coolant or a whole new fridge. Whenever we go out to repair them it's a similar circumstance, and some people just can't afford it due to their living circumstance. It's really sad.

Additionally, because of this, you get a bunch of fridges that people throw away (creating trash) that could otherwise have a bunch of useful parts in them. Old fridges used to last for years and the newer ones get thrown away even faster because they aren't worth a flop."
1,"There are also some basic stuff, people are not think that much, which can not “boost” immune system, but keep it strong - sport, healthy diet, enough sleep, mental health"
1,"Great vid but why the vaccine push at the end? If vaccines are going to be discussed, I want to hear about risks as well. 
Btw, I’m not anti vax. But it’s the one sided propaganda type of takes that make people distrust vaccines."
1,I'd love a video on post COVID syndrome. I always understand things best with this channel.
1,The first one
1,"could you make a video on AI, it is becoming more and more popular.
like how AI has helped us in making an antidote for C-19.
or how it might become our teachers or doctors in the future."
1,"This really feels like propaganda for pharmaceutical companies.

Sure the immune system can have ill effects but  t's the thing that has kept Humanity alive for 50,000+ years before modern medicine"
1,"for a moment I thought they would say something new and innovative but no, nice to see that things never change :D"
1,"You know, acting like the untested emergency injections we were FORCED to take for Covid are the exact same thing as the ones that put an end to polio and other diseases is extremely fucking disingenuous. mRNA injections weren't even tested in a human clinical trial against an infectious agent until 2013.  We literally don't know if those might have any long term side effects because its only been 10 years. And that's not even getting into the rushed version that was forced on us in a global panic response. Why don't you stop huffing big pharma's farts and taking their money."

1,Having purchased and read the book produced on the immune system by this channel I've had many deep and sometimes terrifying shower thoughts on humanity's place in nature and how we're possibly stunting evolution by no longer following nature's rules.

1,People in 3rd world countries drink bad quality their entire life...like they eat un hygienic Street food everyday but it doesn't upset their stomach where as people who had better lifestyle always drank mineral water will get stomach ache from just one time of drinking it.....their body doesn't have strong enough immune system to cope up with it.....

1,Please make an Indonesian version of the channel
1,Dude this was a just get vaccinated ad. But longer. Lmao.
1,I have graduation exam after 3 days and you could be the best most possible teacher I could've wished for grinning_face_with_sweat
1,"The covid vaccine wasn't a proper vaccine though, was it? Your video would have been fine if you'd not made that ""vaccine"" your example, but you can't help yourselves. Even with the injuries finally spilling into the public eye you're still pushing the propaganda. Vaccines are amazing, but the covid vaccine was a corrupt authoritarian mistake and was unlike any other. I imagine you'll double down just as you have been in your willful ignorance of what's happened. In that you're no better than the public school system and the hundreds of scientists over the years who pushed things such as leaded gasoline, radon skin cream, the food pyramid, smoking cigarettes, and obvious lies around the current disaster in Ohio. You get most of the picture straight but fail miserably with some of the most important parts, specifically when you have a misguided political agenda to push, which I'm sure you'll accuse me of. These malicious willful errors will always tarnish your good work and make you frauds. One day you'll have to apologize for all of it, though the more time passes the more damage you do to your great work and it may be the ruin of it all."
1,assuming the vaccine is actually safe.
1," sums up the entire nature vs man made options. For either different people will react differently. It is my opinion for Covid related illness that those 40 and under who are not overweight would have a larger benefit from just getting the disease. Those already susceptible to the disease should probably not risk it and get the shot, but enjoy getting your annual Pfizer booster to do the same thing the natural version does for free. There’s also a lot of science pointing to natural immunity being a much more effective long term solution to a particular disease than vaccine, which require an annual booster to be effective in the case of Covid. Not anti shot, just anti writing off of our absolutely incredible immune system, something we may finally actually understand in 75 years from now."
1,Love that even biology uses duct tape to fix things
1,"While vaccines are indeed very useful to train your immune system, some have strong side effects.
You can be to young (or old) to have a accepteable risk ( I am looking at you corona!), so always talk with your doctor before getting a vaccine!"
1,This is a fantastic video to jump into a topic which could be a really good topic to hear for people; Low Grade chronic inflammation and how it effects healthy aging and onset of other chronic conditions.
1,If my body were a western country I'd already be dead. I'd have used the army to help the invaders get in.
1,"Should of spoke about the correct foods for your temple. Dragon fruit, soursop. Colds and flu's last 1/2 days with these high anti-oxident type of fruits."
1,"Studies indicate that at least for covid the natural immunity is more effective afterwards than the vaccine immunity you get from the vaccine. I think the real thing would provide a better immune response in the future. But maybe I'm wrong but studies did show what I stated at the beginning. Still enjoyed the video but felt it weird to say something like vaccine response is better. It is safer for things that are incredibly fatal like TB, Smallpox, or Measles but I feel like your immune response wouldn't be better than if you got the actual disease. But I'm not a disease expert just where my logic leads me"
1,the thumbnail of this video reminds me of the coronavirus video uploaded a long time ago
1,Why did you bring Covid into this?
1,This channel is funded by billionaires. Wouldn't trust it with anything.
1,Maybe have a video telling us what their spraying in the sky to combat climate change. Or is it causing climate change. Aluminum and barium. It’s killing us. And maybe a video on what the man made mRNA does to your immune system. Let’s get real. Enough of your corporate shill bullshit.
2,Is this cartoon hero pregnant?thinking_face
1,"The immune system will be the final chapter for my biology class this high school, I will try to recommend this (and every other Immune video) to my teachers as learning media"
1,?Already back to vaccine propaganda shortly after TheHatedOne's video?
1,"So there's something I don't understand, if damaged cells are replaced with scar tissue, does that mean when we work out and get microtears it's replaced with scar tissue? Something ain't adding up..."
1,"Video Recommendations:

1. Einstein's Theory of General Relativity: Why Gravity isn't a Force etc
2. Why E = mc^2 and How that Changed Science
3. More on how quarks function and build atoms and how they affect the behavior of atoms.

Just some videos I would love to see! Tell me if they already made a video on the things above!"

1,"kurzgesagt you should do a response video on the propaganda allegations, just for good measures..."
1,"This video is fantastic, I love the metaphors in this. I got more ""sick"" from the covid vax than actually getting covid itself - I even felt worse from the booster after already having covid - but at least I only felt crappy for a couple days after the vaccine rather than weeks, and at least the vaccine didn't mess up my lungs for an entire year. I got sick last January, and only now can I finally do things like make a pot of coffee, eat smoked or spicy food, and clean the cat litter without coughing and choking on my own phlegm again. I'm not perfect yet still, but I was getting worried for a bit that it was going to be permanent."
1,"Video just uploaded, comment from an hour ago."
1,congrats on 20 mil
1,Power of science.
1,"One thing though, you talk about immunity to SARS-CoV-2 with traditional vaccines, not mRNA vaccines, which is what the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is. They are completely different vaccines, one very well researched and tested, one not so much. Having it so the video explains the one really well researched type of vaccine while laying out an example that does not use that type of vaccine is misinforming people, which can affect their health."
1,"Wow, what an informative and engaging video on the immune system!"
1,"You people always say ""the body evolved so it can do so and so"" were you there? Did you see it evolving? Can you reproduce evolution? No? Then stay quite. I don't care how many scientists imagine how life happened then suddenly ended when humans evolved and no other organic or non organic materials change or reproduce. Science is fact not imagination and guesswork."
1,After getting the vaccines for covid i got a lot of symptoms and can barely walk most days. It's been 2 years since getting them and its the same if not worse so i dont buy it.
1,"came for a video about sickness and got a pro vaccine video instead. dont really understand why we need to have videos like these because taking vaccines should be obvious, and everyone who rejects them isn't going to be swayed by a colorful cartoon youtube video"

1,"Bruh. First half of video was good, but second just a clickbait with vaccines promotion wtf.
It's stupid, all vaccines are different.
Also first title was ""natural ways to boost immune system"""
1,Nuclear power is the only future. And secondly why all the vaccine push now? Covid has been over for over a year now.
2,What a treat!
1,"Hold on, is it me or the title/thumbnail was ""How to boost your immune system (with science) or something along those lines when this video was originally posted?"
0,Not me watching this while being sick
1,"Haven’t watched the video but the thumbnail is so real. I got sick a month ago and lost 10 lbs of muscle in less than a week. It wasn’t just water weight either, it’s been weeks and I’ve only made back 4 of the pounds"
1,"I have nothing against vaccines but a good friend who lives in Australia was forced to get the covid vaccine and a booster and now she has permanent ""damage"".  She got really sick directly after getting it and has not fully recovered, and is still having chest pain and such symptoms that aren't related to covid."

tell that to me who got John and johnson vaccine and 4 month later got uncurable autoimunology sickness 

Tell that to all those with bad covid who still were vaccinated 
How mych phizer paid tou?? i guess they need to renew their name since they said to European Union that they never tested for transmision protection and just lied to us they did"
1,"Disagree on vaccine being better then natural immunity and also the evolutionary implications it has for diseases to mutate. Natural immunity randomizes which antigens have antibodies produced in response to them, being more heterogeneous it is broader coverage and prevents self-weaponization of pathogens and protects against those mutations better anyway."
1," You’re slippin neutrophil, and slippin neutrophil I can handle just fine. But slippin neutrophil with a law degree is like a chimp with a machine gun!"
0,Too bad the covid vaccine is garbage.
1,"IIRC, most of the damage from Covid19 actually _was_ your immune system doing collateral damage.
A real immune response is not a save thing to have."

1,Glad I learned all this from your book! It's an amazing read! 
1,"So, a video about the danger of the Immune System that talks about vaccines but doesn't talk about how Immune System activation by vaccines can be detrimental. The agenda is obvious, well intentioned, but in a couple or a dozen years (when we know more about the effects of the current Covid vaccines) they might regret this oversight."
1,"Get Iron Moused Kurzgesagt, the only wide spread person  on the planed that will be bullied because of a inmunitary sistem educational video , I do wonder If we could make an external Inmune system for her because she has no inmunitary sistem at atl.I am also worried because someone precious for me has a inmunitarian problem and I wonder if we should ask a doctor artificially activate neutrofills on her eyes and then combat on an antibiotic and ""steorioids"" strategy"
2,Great video. I'd love to see a video on the effects of smoking tobacco.

2,Very F’ing Interesting grinning_face_with_smiling_eyesthinking_face
1,"What about different advices for training your immune system, like exercising regularly, exposing yourself to sunlight and clean air every day, eating vegetables, meditating regularly, taking multivitamins, not eating junkfood, not drinking sugary products, sleeping 7-8 hours a day, practicing gratitude and so on.
As life approved, these work much better against covid than vaccines which had multiple side effects..."
1,Disliked the video because I disagree with the sponsorship. Carbon offsets are a scam and so is the concept of the carbon footprint.
1,Virtually no healthy young people die from Covid... That's not a very good comparison.

1, what happened to the graph?
1,Again with this...
1,"This interests me greatly actually

Because I tend to have bad hygiene, but I also don't go out and do things, so I'm always constantly questioning in my head, like: does any of this have an effect? Am I not getting sick because my body is used to fighting off tiny stuff, or because I don't go out? Or is it genetics? Or maybe just something else entirely? Will I suffer later? Are some hygiene methods more effective than others? How can I motivate myself to practice these things and which ones are most effective to leading a healthy life?

I simply don't know the answers for what I *should* be doing that is going to actually benefit my long term health, for reasons that aren't just ""common saying"" and ""well people have just always done it that way."" Would definitely be interesting to see honestly."
1,This was fascinating.

1,"honestly this channel makes educational topics fun overall, like i generally get intrested in this. the animations are top tier"
1,Sitting here while my body decides that my thyroid has got to go.
1," - I find it interesting how you talk about the scar tissue and damage to your organs. I work as a paramedic and I got covid from one of my patients, after I was clear of covid I had headaches for three months and now I suffer from brain fog, decent amount of memory issues, and do not operate mentally at the high-level I once used to. Given the nature of covid and the cells it attacks in the body it only makes sense that I got some small amount of damaged brain tissue."
1,Bruh I thought i gonne be a video about training your immunsystem with coldness or vitamins instead I get another liberal hidden vaccine promotion.
1,Nope sorry if my vaccine doesnt give me 5g I'm not taking it
1,"Well, atleast this one isn’t sponsored by the bill and Malinda gates foundation."
1,the girl in the vid can get it fr
1,So it's not an education video but a vaccine video.
1,I caught a cold yesterday so this video is reporting live from my body
1,Bye humans. It was good to know ya all.
1,"Sorry no, the covid vaccine is not a traditonal vaccine."
1,Young people weren't more vulnerable to covid. Old people died in droves and healthy young people died after being vaccinated against covid.
1,"A video on long covid would be an interesting topic, since we're discussing what doesn't kill you making you weaker. I'm covid free for a couple years now now, but the damage the disease did to my body the 2+ weeks I had it has left me with at least 3 permanent health conditions now. It's a serious drain on quality of life for those of us in this boat."
1,Waiting for Americans to say that Kurzgesagt is wrong about vaccines :D
1,I watched your youtube channel since i was in my hospital bed. And you never fail me to entertain me. Thank you for your good videosbeaming_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,"My mother and aunt were basically ""You take all the vaccines you can, the more the better."" as a kid.
Which makes sense since my family is medically oriented myself included so i learned quickly to get all the vaccines you get offered and the ones you can pay, I haven't been to the hospital as a patient in years."
1,I miss the days when astrophysics and quantum physics videos were used to be uploaded.
1,thumbs_up_light_skin_tone
2,I think it is a nice video it is well explained. But sometimes with quite difficult words. And the video is not too long or too short it is good. And it is fun because it is a kind of cartoon it is also more fun to watch and it is quite interesting to find out.slightly_smiling_face

A lot of good the covid vaccine did, other than intensify my tinnitus.  GFY with your vaccines.  I won't get any boosters.  My immune system will prevail, like it has done so many times in the past."
1,"When I was 5 I had strep so bad it seeped into my blood and I became septic, my heart stopped bc of it but they brought me back and I was in the ICU for a week, I still have damage from it in my throat and heart, they said if I ever get strep again it might be far worse, I have gotten it 3 times since then and each time has been less and less worse- immunity is good but who knows maybe the next time I get it I’ll legally die again!"
1,"Having a strong immune response doesn't always mean its a good thing, as u can easily develop autoimmune disorders and allergies. As a person who suffers from allergic asthma, i always get paranoid about getting other major infections but instead i have avoided them all thanks due to my highly sensitive immune system but it also acts as a curse, since i have developed severe allergies."
1,"maybe if authoritarians stopped politicizing common issues, people could work together. Some are addicts to power, and they will try to prove themselves as authority and good even if it takes breaking peoples arms to do it.

Those supposedly in charge of peoples health have no answer to the diabetes or cancer epidemic nor do many promote healthy diet as solution to health problems. That tells alot."

I have atleast recommended to 5 people to watch the channel.

An exciting time to be alive and you guys prove the same!

Thank you Kurzgesagt!"
1,Vaccine VS mrna gene-therapy?
0, im not strong so im dead
1,This is a comment. Its purpose is to show appreciation and tell the algorithm that this video is relevant.
1,the best thing about this channel is that the lessons are so easy to grasp that we can learn stuff from it :)
1,"Your video correctly points out that everyone has a unique immune system but then makes a hypothetical example of Covid killing a young healthy individual but not an elderly individual.  I'm assuming that this is supposed to be an example of how immune responses can sometimes be counter-intuitive but I hope you're not implying that Covid did not affect the elderly much more so than other age groups.  You also suggest that vaccines better prepare our bodies for infections but I'd argue natural immune responses generally-speaking better prepare our bodies' immune systems to respond.  There are exceptions of course, it depends both upon which strain of which infectious agent we're talking about and the health and immune system of the infected.  Also most of humanity's progress against disease has been due to better water sources, water treatment/sewage, sanitation, diet and hygiene etc, not due to medical interventions.  Now, this is not to say that medicines and vaccines have no value.  That's not true, they do have value but just not as much as is implied in this video or some other videos as well."
0,Me watching this while sick: *Intresting*
1,"quick question, is this video funded by bill gates?"
1,"mRNA vaccines though (or at least the earliest ones we got because of Covid) actually aren't better than the disease itself though. The proof is in the supposed necessity of getting booster after booster after booster shot and some papers concluding that not only is the immune response worse.

This is the first batch of mRNA vaccine, we might get much better ones in the future, but this first batch was different to the kind of vaccine we are used to. Including some side effects in menstrual cycle which is kind of alarming. Let's hope the experiment goes better next time or more testing is done."
1,"Infectious Diseases doc here - this was a joy to watch. Loved the Neutrophil analogy cus I refer to them as ""Toddlers hopped up on sugar, running around with shotguns"". Please keep up the fantastic, always informative work!"

1,"I'm early sick rn noticed a sore throat yesterday and it got worse today so I'm catching a cold again (it happens to me very easily and often, so I watched this hoping to find a way to boost my immune system-
Sadly that wasn't actually really in the video (besides vaccine but not like I can get that against a cold lmao) but still very awesome video. At least I learned that yep my immune system is weak especially to colds, though I just get sick very often in herena) general"
1,Don‘t you have any plans to make AI-related videos? There is a prediction that the pace of development will gradually change exponentially and the world will change completely in a few years.
1,"I'm sorry. I've been a fan of this channel for years but this video is HORRIBLY one-dimensional. you cannot use this title for a video that completely leaves out all natural factors that benefit your immune system. which are, of course, nutrition, movement / sports, sunlight, fresh air und social contacts. please re-upload with according additions."
1,How about actually showing how to empower immunity? Ahhh.
1,Neutrophils. The American forces of immune cells. Sprays and hope to hell that there’s no FF.

This is a great marker of education for the future generations and it is because of the excellent content that you all create and provide in content on this channel is the reason I am subscribed and, one day, hope to be able to become a patron and support you all <3"

I was unable to walk or use my hands for a week because of all the sores on my extremities.  Doctor told me ""that's just how some people react to HFM, no there isn't anything I can give you just suck it up and wait it out""."

1,"Take that, anti-vaxxers!!! raising_hands_medium-light_skin_tonesyringe I actually did not expect this video to be about vaccines, I expected something like maybe eating more protein for your muscles? But since I get vaccines anyway, that must mean my immune system is ""boosted"" much more that it would be otherwise!"
1,do a video on something new plz
1,I found out that humans are a bit like viruses because: a virus invades a cell like we « invaded » Earth 50 000 years ago and we are killing the planet like a virus killing a cell and then searching other planets ro invade and kill.

1,"What if I am a bodybuilder eating 4000 calories per day (500 surplus)  and 300+ grams of protein per day, will getting sick break down my muscle tissue?"
1,"I think the best method to boost your immune system is not vaccines necessary, but being healthy. Vaccines need the immune system working well, and its not, they will not work. Sometimes train your immune system with nature dojo is better, not for the damage and scars, but for the more diverse protection you will adquire (this not applies if enter this dojo is much more risky)."

I actually did not know it has such benefits and I did it for completely different reason. But this byproduct was very surprising and awesome).

That number is so small that is it almost a negligible and relies heavily on what you would consider healthy (some people think they are healthy because they don’t understand how unhealthy being overweight or sleep deprived is). I think it would be safer to say some young people became extremely sick for some reason while some old people breezed through it. Probably most safe to not talk about Covid all together because so much is unknown or not yet proven.

Edit: I do like this channel and even most of this video but sometimes oversimplification and generalization should not be used. I know Covid is a complicated topic but maybe don’t cover it at all if you’re not going to be completely honest. Maybe use words more carefully."

1,"""This video is sponsored by Pfizer."""
1,"Summary, go vaxx yourself. I was expecting less of a ""brought to you by Pfizer"" add and more of a general, practical outlook on immunizing (e.g. vitamin D and Zinc intake). After all: ""what eat and don't eat, kills you."" This makes sense if you understand your body has to ""eat"" those pathogens before it can be infected. The correlation of food and pathology i.e. what kills you is extremely strong. Oxidative and carcinogenic particles in food heavily contribute to most of the causes of death of Western people, especially colon cancers. A damaged body from the particles has less capacity for anything, weakening the immune defense. This  comment has more practical value than the funded animation. That is super sad."

1, that's kinda sus
1,"Ah so this is why you should get your covid vaccine. Even though it doesn't make you immune. Even though it makes you sick (sometimes even sicker than the virus itself.)

Also reduce your carbon footprint. Even though the majority of carbon emissions are from the mega rich. Amd even if everyone switched to electors cars and reduced their footprint to zero, the environment would still be in serious dangerous. 

Also pay to plant trees to reduce emissions. Even though this will take about 30 years to have a significant impact. And that's assuming the tree you pay to plant is actually planted and stays alive (which, you're not gonna check so what do you know?)"

I didn't but now I have several braincells permanently devoted to those ""facts"" that I will never get back.

I do at least appreciate that the NHS had a sense of humor about the whole thing and parked a vaccination consultation trailer (complete with one of the dreaded defibrillators!) less than 100 feet from the thankfully small group of morons with placards.

It's not that I think there's no good science behind them, but I simply do not trust the manufacturers who are owned by the kinds of super-wealthy people which built the Georgia Guide Stones and advance Malthusian thought through climate and sustainability policies (e.g. they want to stop you from breeding and possibly sicken/kill you if you're European stock). Ad hominems aside I also don't trust the manufacturers to not cut corners to increase profit margins, which could mean shots which contain more adjuvant which will cause the body to not only attack viral particles but also overreact to potentially allergenic substances. A great way to go ""Oops, I guess we have more lifelong customers of autoimmune control drugs now! :^)""

1,"It's genuinely sad how many people will deny this basic biology established a century ago, often due to being emotionally invested in a political view to which they linked it. The same thing with the theories of evolution and even globe heliocentrism..."
1,"why does it feel like you're covering the same topic again and again, but with different animations?"
1," in the top part of the white bubble on the right, over the middle red circle.. looks like a wiener..."
1,yay another pro covid vaccine video!
1,wow this would have been a great opportunity to show how mRNA vaccines are fundamentally different than transitional ones
2,Keep doing the great work Kurzgesagt team <3
1, They snuck Calimero into the animation :D
1,MNRA Gene therapy you mean. Vaccines are no more
1,I hope BioNTech did not fund this video.
1,Is he talking about the Corona virus that leaked from china?
1,Thank you so much for your work and dedication delivering us those fantastic videos!
1,bro i heard so many hoi4 terms in the space of 2 minutes i can't bro skull
1,A kurzgesagt video keeps the boredom away!
1,What is the graph doing at ?
1,Sooo.. you are saying Dwight was wrong!? People have been sneezing on my bread for years thanks to him..
2,Thanks for introducing me to Wren !
1,Make A video about how to stay health red_heartfolded_hands
1,"Never forget two things :  
First : A disease can kill you in a few days, but your immune system can kill you in mere minutes, you can thank allergies.
Second : Read Immune, it's a very interesting book."
1,bruh forget the monalisa now this is what i xall a mastetpeice
1,"Cool video but you should have also covered the vital importance of good quality sleep, exercise and nutrition is to the immune system in general.

A lot of the younger generations sleep poorly (various reasons, substance abuse, tech addiction etc), don't exercise much (be that cardio and resistance training), are overweight or morbidly obese and eat and drink crap (lots of sugar , sweeteners and trans fats that causes inflammation, high blood pressure / cholesterol and diabetes), this makes their immune system and overall body health weak and no amount of vaccines are going to help a body in this kind of terrible state as the immune system has to be healthy to learn from the vaccines effectively to begin with."
1,"Are Kurzgesagt getting funding from vaccine companies or something..? Chances are if you're watching this page, you're not anti-vax. Would appreciate a video that is fun instead of ANOTHER vaccine push...."

It's shit"

1,Funny this vid comes out as I'm sick in bed right now
1,"cool more propaganda, do i do it by taking bill gates vaccines?"
1,Why do you change the title of the video ???
1,the music in this video sounds like you're searching for an answer to a math problem until you find it at  and I love it
1,"Narrator: let's start an invasion and see what happens.
Me: wait,what?"
1,I was procrastinating with this instead of studying for an immunology exam. This basically summarised all the subjects needed. Thanks for making it enjoyable
1,So does each bird represent the person who animated that scene?
0,"""Anything that does not kill you, makes you very weak. And almost killed""

1,Thanks for the video y'all! I really appreciate all the accessible knowledge y'all put out every week! :)
1,nice try Bill Gates
1,"I love how the background music has the leitmotif of the Vaccines risk video, as a subtle reference to the previous topic"
2,I love seeing all the dislikes and the angry comments whenever they mention vaccine lmao
1,Yes I agree vaccines that are tested and proven for at least 10 years. Other than that nature dojo
1,"This makes so much sense. I got COVID this past December after going three years without getting sick, and now have been sick twice since. My system totally got weakened and hasn't yet recovered because winter takes such a toll on my health."
1,during the covid pandemic my entire family got sick one by one but i never got sick of covid soo... i guess im immune to covid
1,Man I didn't know my cells are war criminals

1,Open YouTube see Kurzgesagt upload I click
1,Anymore Billionaires to stick up for lately?
1,"My girlfriend's whole family got a covid vaccine, then a month later they'll all got sick and tested positive for covid.
I attended the ""nature dojo"" and never got sick despite being around all them while they were sick.

Those greedy pharmaceutical bastards won't get a $20 subsidy from the government on my behalf!
(yes I unironically believe I was better off not getting vaccinated, and I have anecdotal evidence to prove it!)"
1,Is it only telling us to get vaccinated? What a joke
1,never for get one of the most dangerous beings on the planet is you
1,I’m just here to hear the opposition from conspiracy theorist face_with_tears_of_joy
1,Soooo there was told absolutelly nothing about how to improve immune system. Only that vaccines work (and we know it).
1,"another great clip :)
however- about sponsor - again, blaming one human beeing is a mistake. Should be portal showing which company and country You supoose to push, or smth"
1,everytime u guys post i think the animation cannot get any better and everytime you prove me wrong
1,"yeah ive seen enough to know that i wont be watch you anymore.
1, non fact checked sourced prevails through all of your content
over double the millions  you have earned as a company is coming from billionaires. not your patreons. so that was a lie
you have basically made every video in conjuntion with your donors beliefs

bill and melinda gates are the part-owners of your fact checking organization


this  is wild.
i wont be watching yall"
1,I'd love to see a video on how stress/anxiety affects the immune system and can cause or aggravate certain conditions
1,"Just like in real war my body bombs my own cities when they're occupied by the enemy, uses a scorched earth tactics and sacrifices every single citizen to save the elites."

Nice work."
1,"Guys, if you believe in needing 3 vaccines for COVID, pay close attention to the vaccine part."
1,"Maybe show your sponsors at the beginning of the video? No? Well, what to expect from billionaire puppets ..."
2,keep making such videos we love these interesting biology topics and thank you for letting us watch such wonderful and informational videos for free. red_heartred_heart
1,No idea how the algorithm figured out I was sick and pushed this video on my feed! grinning_face_with_sweat
1,"I had this exact conversation yesterday. I said that sometimes what doesn't ""kill you"" doesn't make you stronger. Though we were talking about emotional pain. And now I hear this same phrase here. I did blame Kelly Clarkson (as a joke) for making us believe in that."
1,Hopefully this video isn’t funded by bill gates aswell!!!!
1,"I know your channel tries to be relatable, but drawing parallels from the current war in Ukraine is pretty cheap and insensitive. Try a new writer thumbs_up"
1,Gaining knowledge from ur videos is easy but pronouncing ur channel name is hard
1,"In actually early!

Always a good day when you upload!! :)"
1,And to think I'm immune to the winter flu (Influenza) .covid dose make me sick but only a constant running nose.  Bronchitis Same thing
0,That which does not kill you... mutates and tries again.
1,Disappointing to see you've chosen this direction. I thought you had more integrity. Apparently I was wrong about that.
1,"Pushing vaccines and global warming lol. ""It zee bugz!"""
0,climate change......fake!!
1,Hey I love your animation keep it going! Very informational too
2,Yall we in the spirit?
1,You guys should make a video about Karl Marx and his ideias!! I've been thinking about it and maybe the only way to save the planet is to make our whole planet communist! (no kidding)
1,"Immune system : “Oh look. The same cold virus we’ve fought 1000 times before with a slightly different shape”
“Oh.. that’s fine, right? I can just go about my da-“

Immune system : *”Get your ass in bed, private, we’re going to war”*"
1,Vaccine propaganda for tracking nanites!
1,"How to deal with heavy metals in the vaccines, I don’t think that taking flu vaccines every year will make your life better in the long run"
0,This hits harder when you are sick.
2, …Reminds me of a certain chimpanzee
1,"in china the covid's vaccination became a political problem and many people were kinda forced to get vaxxed, some of them would show severe side effects, some of them being pregnant woman/the old which is not suitable for a vaxx shot.
when i know this info from the hospital i worked it real shocked me."
1,Within 7 hours!
1,"This was an overall good video and you should stick with science orientated videos like this, but I swear these billionaire sponsorships you're getting about Carbon offset is doing nothing to improve conditions, the system is the same no matter what action is taken. It may act as relief, but the real problem of carbon emissions lies in the corporations and rich capitalist class that has been studied and proven to emit far more emissions than the bottom 50%, 60%, maybe even 90% of the world population. I will always do my part to reduce my own personal carbon emissions, but the same billionaires that support you are the same billionaires that cause these problems in the first place.
You have been a fantastic channel teaching loads of wonderful science videos about every aspect of science, but you then push a narrative about reduction and then provide sponsors who are funded and supported by the same rich scum that has caused these issues in the first place, the one and only direction for true social and environmental progress isn't one through the Capitalist system, but one through a system designed and for the worker class people, one that is in the interests of the needs of people rather than the profits of a few individuals. So please just stop shilling billionaire nonsense."
1,"It seriously bugs me when people are like ""yeah I got really bad side effects from x vaccine""... did you have a seizure? did you have a stroke? did you go into anaphylactic shock? No? Then no, you didn't have a bad reaction or side effect. Getting cold or flu like symptoms from a vaccine means your immune system is actually responding appropriately and the vaccine is taking effect. Stuff like seizures, strokes, and shock is what an actual adverse reaction to a vaccine is, and they're incredibly rare, and less deadly than the disease in most cases."
1,I like this channel but this is just promoting the covid vaccine..
1,Hello There!
2,ecosia is a free alternative to wren if anyone wants to help but doesnt have money
1,U need to specify vaccine. The current covid vaccines are not vaccines they are gene therapy. You should do a video on all the lies told about the covid vaccine. And the side effects they are not talking about and censoring from media.
1,Covid has done so much damage to human knowledge that Kurzegagst has to try to fix it
2,All the videos on this channel are just too great
1,"lol... you had me until vaccine. you obviously are not an engineer, considering the way you use the word 'engineer' face_with_rolling_eyes"

1,PLEASE make a new app
1,"Damn. I suffered tb in 2019 tho i was cured over the coarse of 6 months, my xrays show that i dont have lung scars, but my doctor insists that its there. My lungs capacity to collect oxygen is impaired? Or is it possible to not scar when having tb?"
1,"If everyone had decent high school level education, we wouldn't need these videos.  But we definitely do!  
Thank you."
1,"Well interesting time for this video to come out, especially considering some of the data that's being revealed.  Particularly the one that shows a massive spike in the ""nature dojo"" failures at the exact same time the ""vaccine dojo"" was introduced.  Quite the implication isn't it?  That people getting the vaccine caused people who didn't to expire.  Or perhaps that one category was being shuffled into the other."
1,Is Bill Gates one of your larger financial supporters?
1," _""...this is why seemingly very healthy young people died from Covid, while for some elderly people it was more like a mild flu...""_
Wow. This is wildly misleading.
 _""...the immunity you get from a vaccine is often better than the natural resistance...""_ This is a blatant, provable lie.
Is Pfizer a donator to Kurzgesagt now? What is going on over there?"
1,"Unless we don't have some revolutionary new means to multiply food production, ending diseases would just mean about the same number that would have died from diseases will starve instead."
1,Waw first time this early
1,This was very informative. I think I need to take more care to avoid minor sickenesses like colds and diarrhea.
1,"brand new. also, this is nice"
1,"Wow. You guys really are shilling SO extra hard these days. I used to be a monthly patron at $10, now I'm unsubscribing.

Get back to making the videos you want to make, not the videos that billionaires are paying you to make for them."
1,We want translet arabiccrying_face
1,Ive got a serious chronic illness and I can tell u the immune system doesn't mess around when it doesn't like something
1,could you do the autoimmune disease celiac disease? to show what happens when the immune system keeps attacking its small intestine sells when it detects gluten?
1,"when I had covid I felt absolutely fine. So im assuming I am a ""Quick responder"""
1,It’s sad seeing the anti-Vaxxers in the comments ignoring everything said In the video and  making random irrelevant claims about the government and bribery.
1,Take untested vaccines but no mention of vitamin D
1,Why did you guys change the thumbnail :⟨
1,"I still dont understand completely why vaccines doesnt cause scar tissue. Obviosly, the vaccine doesnt attack your cells, but your immune reaction to the vaccine will still destroy your own cells, dont they?"
1,My friends stopped watching this channel because it's a billionaire propaganda farm sadly
1,So funny seeing anti Vaxxers getting themselves all wound up in the comments
1,Vax might have caused lot of auto immune diseases lately.
1,"When you eat right? Your invincible , with good diet comes great immune system, you'll never get sick as long as you continue to replace white blood cells and antibodies."
1,Good job! Another big pharma shill. Sorry boys but I’ll always remain a pure blood
1,"Can u pin ur first video linkin this channel in the next video
Pls"
1,"So, practically your memory T-cell and B-cells don't do anything? (The beginning says that what doesn't kill you weakens you.) So what about the memory cells once you beat the illness? thinking_face"
2,I keep getting distracted with the animation. It's so cute!!!!!
1,Now get your next shot. Sponsoren by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
1,I have chronic plaque psoriasis. My immune system is a jackass.
2,My immune system is attacking my gym gains!?
1,I doubt people will have the same trust towards vaccines from now on...
1,MY AMMUN SITEM IS STRONG AND DA ONLY WAY I GET SICK IS FROM WATER I M SICK NOW BECAZ I DROPT IN WATER IN DA OSSIN
2,Thanks for the video!
1,Funny thing is that i have been drinking and smoking weed for 20 years... i am 30 in august. feel like i might have some kinda dissease but i dont feel it and i dont want to find out by going to the doctor and finally they say i got cancer. i am asthmatic since  birth. only thing i can give excuses is how fit and good of a sportsman i was... no brag
2,the voice is literally so relaxing
1,I saw in another one of your videos that 99% of immune cells need to be destroyed before being allowed to enter the body's circulatory system. It makes you wonder if we were almost 100% efficient and still produced even only 10% of what we do we would still have an immune system that's 10x as capable. We would be like untouchable fortresses that only get infections on extremely rare occasions even things like cancer would be much more uncommon. Mainly microbes wouldn't hurt us and would just serve as decomposers. It's crazy to just to think about what a different world that would be.
1,The updated thumbnail really reminds me of the Covid-19 vid
1,"I can’t believe you cucked and have turned into a propaganda machine for Puh-Fizer. Unsubbing, disliking and I recommend my fellow pure bloods to do the same"
2,Thank you for such an educational video!
1,My immune system is EXTREME like i Get sick 1 time evry 1.3 years
2,Great video
1,Are you paving the way for the new vaccines?
1,So I guess my body was pretty good at defending against Covid because I never got sick from that even though my mom and dad both got it and I only got the first part of the vaccine after it was mostly over
1,"Post COVID (alpha) I lost 45% of my lung function... I've since grabbed every updated vaccine, because while I did, indeed, survive COVID, I do not think I have much lung function to gamble with."
1,LOL you forget ONE important thing you said years ago that you only need ONE vaccine and not 3 or 4 for the same thing. Def of a vaccine is it protects you from infection and you can't give it to other people. Those two things don't apply for the corona vaccines
2,I was feeling sick for few days and this is the best upload.
1,would love to see vaccine deniers watch this video
1,You can break up scars. Heal over time
1,From a planet to a country that’s a big down grade
1,"Why are the comments starting to look like those comments recommending Financial Advisor bullshit? Seriously, these ""This video change my life"", ""I'm a biomedical student-professor"", ""I read it in the book written by Genius Chimps"" cannot be real comments right?"
2,"I should not have laughed at that graph, I feel so stupid face_with_tears_of_joy"
2,I feel like this was your most profitable video yet......
1," immunity you get from a vax is better than natural immunity? fucking what, lol. i don't know, all those millions of people that got vaxxed against covid but still got sick from it, spread it and still had to take more boosters and vaccines to do what simply going through covid did one time seems to not add up."
1, *_BUT SLIPPIN JIMMY WITH A LAW DEGREE IS LIKE A_*
1,Have you all noticed that the monkey in the intro is always holding different in each videos? XD
1,When covid-19 started I didn't even feel anything
0,Stop doing propaganda and I'm your fan
1,"There is no immune system. Your body can produce enzymes to remove poison. If you poison yourself over and over, your body will make enzymes to remove the poison in expectation of you poisoning yourself again. Such as a alcoholic drinking vodka every day can ""handle"" more of that poison because his/her body expects it. If the drunk stops drinking vodka, the body will cease having the enzymes on the ready. This is why so many alcoholics die upon returning to the drink. Their body is not ready for it. You can not take poison and become immune to it. This is also true of ""viruses."" Think about that the next time you are told to get a vaccine."
1,"This video was sponsored by big pharma, Bill gates, china and the very people telling you to not trust your body…"
1,"Not more than I thinkflushed_face. Mine has me in a wheelchair by 55 yrs old and has me with one barely decent arm and one that’s almost useless.  Autoimmune diseases get the least amount of funding for big diseases like heart disease, cancer and especially aids.  All of which I’d rather have than what I have.  Sucks that autoimmune diseases are treated separately. There’s studies for Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Hashimoto and some others when I would think if they all worked on the immune system, they’d have a better chance of finding a way to fix the immune system and cure all immune diseases.  Who knows. What I do know is most rare autoimmune diseases don’t have enough patients for drug companies to make money on."
2,"Great vid, two thumbs up"
2,Great and meaningful video as always!
1,"I really like how all of this is explained, this has gotta be one of my favorites"
1,Why not mention change in diet and personal habits as an immune boosting strategy which it is?
1,You would be considered a right winger to suggest doing something to be healthy 2 years ago.
1,"Videos like this have made me much kinder to myself. Realising just how much work my body puts into staying alive and how mind-bogglingly complex it all is has given me a much deeper apprecition for a body that I always resented for being chronically ill and ""broken"". Now I feel like it's miraculous I'm here at all!

I also really appreciate the reminder that activating your immune system requires a huge amount of energy. I've been feeling really tired and down and have zero motivation for anything since I suffered some significant burns last week. I just keep having to remind myself that it's perfectly normal and healthy to not feel up to anything while my body is busy taking care of me."
0,BRO WTF 6 MINUTES AND 450 COMENTS
1,How much did Bill Gates pay for this video
1,ignore antivaxxers just remember that the legend has uploaded again
1,Pretending that the covid vaccine is just like all other precious vaccines is disingenuous to say the least. Leaving a dislike for that
1,"Just do anyone who reads this is a little more educated, this channel AND a lot of the sources they use for their research are heavily funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, and this channel exists to create propaganda for billionaires like Bill Gatesthumbs_up"
1,whoa....
1,"Nice video, but since you've already done another about vaccines, I thought this one would be about allergies and autoimmune diseases - times when your immune system is quite dangerous. It would be nice to approach them in the future!"
1,"This video was actually perfectly timed for me, I’m still actively overcoming some dumb virus that I’ve had for like 3 weeks at this point, 8 of those days bro g absolutely awful and the rest just mildly annoying"
1,"Uuuuh, im waiting for the “sponsored by Pfizer” plug"
1,wren doesn't take land area you have and plants growing there in his carbon foot print calculation
1,I get ravenously hungry when im sick
1,"im currently about half way through a biomedical science degree and funnily enough was studying the immune system today in lectures. We did a similar level of detail to this video, and im honestly impressed with the detail and how well communicated a fairly complex topic is in this video. I am passionate about making science more diverse and accessible and kurzgesagt never fails to uphold this gold standard"
1,is it just me or does kurzgesagt change their video thumbnails and titles a few times after uploading a video?
1,You don’t have to tell me. My immune system destroyed my kidneys. Fun stuff.
1,i love the idea my eyes are more scared of my immunesystem than i am afraid of life
1,"Mate, we all love your content, buuut this biology stuff has been going on for too much man. Maybe space? Or human history?"
1,"Should have mentioned auto immune diseases, which are often triggered by infections. They are the most dangerous part of the immune system."
1,I love your videos about the immune system! Keep making more and more. I read immune the book when it released and it became one of my favorite books of all time!
1,"Oh no what have you done you’ve given the anti-VAX a reason to be anti-VAX what have you done? No, don’t let the anti-VAX See this"
1,"Kurzgesagt may make good videos,  but we all know money controls them"
1,It would be fantastic if you do a part 2 video about the immune system in the context of autoimmune disorders to explain how the body attacks itself and what happens in these situations.
1,"So sad to see Kurzgesagt having become a mouthpiece of the terrorist fearmongering globalists who seek to enslave mankind trough deceitful and evil propaganda, like the ""climate crysis"" and ""kovyd vaxxynes""."
1, i died laughing in this moment .cells cant take it anymore

1,Continued propaganda even after all we've learned. I'm certain this video was sponsored by Phizer
1,"lol i never had covid symptoms

probably will die from a cold tho"
1,Wouldn’t you say that the issue is mostly corporate greed for climate change? They don’t care about us.
2,"Very useful video, thank you!"
2,It's so great animated. :)
2,One of the best channels on youtube love you guys
1,Very topical of Kurzgesagt to release this video when I’m dealing with the worst flu I’ve had in years while on three different painkillers.
1,Kurgesagt can you talk about the cordyceps fungus in the next video?
1,Finally a new video of the Immunsystem waited very long for itthumbs_up
1,So you are saying that scars are filled with off-brand skin?
1,"I know it is a sponsor, but based off all the research this channel has done you should know that buying carbon offsets is mostly a scam/token and no one should be fooled into thinking it will meaningfully contribute to bailing us out of our co2 hole. Lots of companies claim to be carbon neutral due to offsets and they honestly are just PR statements. Hardly anyone even investigate that the money for offsets is even going to the things they claim they are."
1,"Literally propaganda loudly_crying_facejust watched a video on how this Chanel was invested by billionaires and it was pushing their agenda,instead of telling people to be healthy,not eat shit and exercise and the secrets of health they telling you to take the vaccine loudly_crying_faceim mad disappointed"
1,"""Say after me,  it's no better to be safe than sorry.""

The idea we will overcome disease entirely is up there with we will upload our minds to the net and live forever.

Also once again you've glazed over the faults of Vaccines to push the idea we have stronger better understanding than we do."
1,You lost me at vaccines. No one trusts vaccines anymore. Too much corruption
1, I’d never thought that Kurzgesagt would do a Better Call Saul reference
1,How much is Bill Gates paying you guys?
1,It feels illegal to be this early
1,Agreed on everything except covid. Doesn’t apply as well to viruses that mutate that often

1,"I wanna see an anti vaxer watch this, but they'll most likely pull some random no brain question then act smug like they proved that they're essential oils will kill COVID"
1, I think you made a mistake on your graph
1,"So carbon offsetting is both awesome, and basically useless beyond a certain extent. At the end of the day, with current technology, even if all the money in the world went to offsetting carbon emissions, we wouldn't make up for even a *fraction* of our emissions. There isn't enough space for that many trees on earth, even if the earth were ten times bigger. If you want to reduce emissions, the only way to do that is to reduce emissions;  as individuals we account for, by many estimates, far below a single percentile of emission sources. It's large corporations that are responsible for the rest, and they are who we need to target (as well as prevent from using carbon offsets as not only are they mostly BS in particular at a corporate-emissions level but many corporations have been engaging in completely phony, faked carbon offsetting through companies that don't really do anything to offer emissions). Carbon offsets are nice, but they help about as much as making sure you wash a single takeout container before recycling it. Sure, it might have a higher chance of being partially recycled. Still leaves waste, and depending on your region, many items in blue bins actually go straight to landfill either in your country or another (like in the UK for example). Not only is the benefit often completely overblown or totally fudged to us, but even if it isn't we simply don't have the infrastructure in place to recycle as much as we pretend to, (speaking Canada, US & UK) nor does any company have the resources or infrastructure to employ carbon offsets at the rates they imply. Which is fine, because carbon offsets are not an answer to anything. They're a bandaid, sure, but they're advertised as a full bandaging when they're more like a button bandaid that falls off after an hour."

1,Great vídeo! Can't wait to watch it un SPANISH
1,""" Let's start an invasion and see what happens."" clapping_hands"
1,The cytokines look… sus to say the least…
1,"not to add that in case of Chickenpox nature dojo leaves you with a herpesvirus (more exactly Varicella-zoster virus), so the vaccine you got as a kid can safe you later in life from shingles.
The worst part is that there were Pox partie's which leave you with the risk of getting shingles later in live ."
1,The monkey holding monkeypox in the opening sequence was a brave choice.
1,What do you mean calculate and offset my carbon footprint? You're taking money to recycle old BP marketing jargon they used to redirect  their responsibility for climate change.
1,"Vaccine is good IF it is actually proven effective. Pfizer CEO stepped down, the use of Astrazeneca vaccine is suspended. You btw are funded by Gates for propaganda. Ew"
1,"I think calling  them barbarians, instead of coumtries is better."
0,Dies of death
1,"Vaccines- good for the ""chain links"" but weakens the ""chain""
 Nature- strengthen chain, gets rid of weak links."
1,"Wow thank you, I've been thinking about this topic recently, your animation is as good as ever, the monkey at the opening eat the virus..."
1,damn somebody give that monkey some food its eating a virus now ive never bothered to comment whatever  it eats
2,why does this feel like propaganda
1,Is the thumbnail supposed to be the eyes on the billboard from The Great Gatsby
2,Wow just wow. No words can describe how great your videos are.
1,This video is probably funded by bill again.
1,I can't get sick cause i have 10 trillion power in rise of kingdoms
1,"Awesome stuff as always!
Please do a Video about ADHD"
2," Whoa, what happened there lmao"
0,"I currently have throat pain when swallowing, as well as unexplained tiredness. (As of currently, the tiredness is only sometimes.)

So I decided to watch this again."
1," if the ~2000s part of this graph doesn't say alot.... 
Seriously though, anti vaxxers are really not helping the whole ""living"" thing"
1,"I literally got a flu yesterday, and I'm soo tired and have been lying on my bed all day. It's crazy how youtube just recommended me this video today. This morning, I searched up on google, ""Feeling weak, headache and coughing."" Man, it's kinda scary how whatever you search on google, you get recommended something similar on YouTube."
0,Who else is sick while watching this?
2,Nice advertising...
1,A good quote I heard once is our immune system is the equivalent of seeing a spider in the forest and burning down the forest to kill it.
1,"It it just me, or did they make the cytokines look like among us people."
1,Changing titles and thumbnails? I thought you were better than hits Kurzgesagt.
1,Love the immune system vids and book. One of my favorite topics. <3
1,I'm disturbed by how good of an analogy pokemon is for vaccines
1,Suprised this video isn’t sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundtiin
1,"No infection exist*
Immune system: ""im so bored, lets attack some healthy cell"""
1,"and then there is mine which beats my platelets, red cells and even neutrophil (Evans syndrome)"
2,Another good vid been watching since 2017 love the channel
1,this was posted just when i tested positive for cov!d lmaoo
1,This is the information this channel puts out was almost more informative than my entire school education. Kids need to be taught more about life and the world around them.
1,"just don't forget that what was called ""vaccine"" for covid, actually was not because it didn't provide immunity and memory cells, so, stick to proven vaccines which showed results for decades"
0,Why is your immune system dangerous?????
1,Imagine osmosis jones but a war movie
1,"Mr Gates sure must have paid you a bundle to sell your soul like this.  ALL of your subscribers should tell you where to stick it and unsub immediately because this BS propaganda needs to go.  For those of you blind to what is going on here I feel for you but this channel is nothing but a shill for Vaccine companies trying to tell you how dangerous it is to weather an infection on your own and how you should really be training your immune system with their product.  Its BS, this entire video is bullshit propaganda!"
1,"I can't even remember the last time I was sick and the last time I got a vaccine for anything was when I was a baby (27 years ago) and my parents were forced to get me vaccinated. I never take any medication and the only ressource I trust when it comes to defending sicknesses is through nature itself. If I ever die from an infection, it was meant to be. It's not going to be easy to accept once it hits, but it's the only way I will accept. In no way, shape or form will I ever again rely on something man made when it comes to science and health. Vaccines and medication feel like a trick humans invented to 1) Make money and 2) Play god over natural selection. I won't say it, because someone will feel attacked, but if we had natures way, we would be a lot tougher as a species today. A lot less illnesses and disabilities would exist that way. I wonder who would be interested in that not being the case. I get the feeling, that this whole video is basically propaganda for vaccines. Also: Preparing for people who dislike my take to attack me instead of discussing it slightly_smiling_face"
1,"Wait, so I shouldn't lower my fever with some pill?"
1,Starts at  for anyone wanting quick answers.
1,I learned more in 10 minutes than in all of school biology
2,I love how they are adapting the immune book so good smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,"just here to say you are a puppet of billionaires, this is not science"
1,Can you please explain to me why the graph on  looks like that? Cause it seems impossible to me.
1,This channel has clearly gone to trying to appeal to the woke mob
1,"Nice video as always! Weird however, how many conspiracy ideots infested this comment section. Hope you still continue to make these."
1,That virus tower defense game at  looks sweet.  I'd play that.
1,"I watched this video expecting some science fiction or theoretical futuristic solutions, and instead it was ""please get yourself and your children vaccinated for the love of god please I beg you"""
1,"I got a chest infections December 3 weeks then got antibiotics still felt shit turned to sinus infections - more antibiotics finally better 

Now having probiotics gut health"
2,Very nice I am interested this video so beautiful
1,Basically RTS on a micro level face_with_monocle
1,"If you actually X-tay the body of our test buddy actually kinda weird, because you can still see the eyes"
0,An immune cell with anger issues is like a chimp with a machine gun.
2,the WHO shilling was so obvious. lol
2,"Well informed, well animated red_heart"
1,"Me in Ukraine: trying to relax in Youtube
Youtube: IMMUNE WAR, TANKS, *boom*
/joke"
1,Thank you so much Kurzgesagt for trying to make the world a better place even though there are many MANY people who are so delusional that they reject things like nuclear reactors and vaccines which are easy solutions to our problems without almost any drawbacks.
1,"wonder how much of this is real, with all the AI stuff how do i not know youre just saying what i wanna hear? that the voice isnt being generated. and the animations could be ai generated too. i dont know who to trust til i see it with my own eyes and feel the presence"
1,"Immune system, really. You're supposed to help, not hurt."
1,What's the difference between genetic therapy and vaccines?
1,I Survived COVID in 1-2 days that was easy
1,"Huh, that explains why I get minor colds quite frequently but never seriously sick (although covid was pretty nasty)"
1,Me watching this with a stomach bug wondering if I possibly have a scar from a prior one I had a while ago. anxious_face_with_sweat
1,"That's a fine animation. But ""vaccine"" against SARS-COV-2 is not a vaccine. It is a man-made gene therapy. I think that should be noted."
0,Ironic I just got sick
1,your immune system video's are my favorite thank you for bringing us this fascinating info
1,The only reason I don't get vaccines is because I dislike needles.
1,I have literally seen all of your videos
1,hy you do not a model of your chiken plis give me a model do creat a game cool pleas!
1,Isn’t climate change in the hands of big business?
1,Took the test. Own 6 vehicles (2 being motorcycles) and we only ever really drive our daily car which gets like 35mpg. Drive the others maybe twice a year which are insaine gas guzzlers other than one which gets like 25-28mpg. I'm off the charts with co2 lol. I'm good otherwise with solar panels and barely eating even though I eat hella meat. :p
1,"It's a bit sad to see an advertisement for offsetting carbon footprints by planting trees or ""removing CO2 from the air"". Trees don't take carbon out of the cycle, and removing CO2 has a terrible energy efficiency. I can imagine a very critical video about those things... by Kurzgesagt."
1,Brought to you by the Bill and Melinda Gates propaganda machine.
1,Makes you feel bad for the people who’s immune systems work against them.
1,"Hot take: Computers don't get viruses, we created them. So if humans did not have viruses, we...
Computers have bugs in their software, which is natural, humans have pain which too is natural. But both of these entities have no viruses until someone... grinning_face_with_big_eyesgrinning_face_with_big_eyes"
1,"Comes across as pro mRNA shot propaganda. We know there are serious problems with this technology that are not addressed. Its not a traditional vaccine which I have no problem with. 
Always liked this channel but seems to be a mouthpiece for the establishment, shame!"
1,why is the animated person so over weight?
1,"""Your immune system is a jerk. Don't rely on your body. Rely on vaccine science."" Evil propaganda."
1,I still think you need to make this into a game...
1," (per xkcd) Biologist: ""This is a graph of the death rate from infectious disease. The heroes of my field have SLAIN one of the four horseman of the apocalypse."""
1,"Just three words
VIM HOF METHOD"
0,the diseases is dangerous
1,Why I can see amogus patterns in cells in this vid.
1,These are basically modernized Bill Nye
1,"Thank you for this video! I've had cancer twice and now I may have MS. I feel like my body keeps fighting itself and I certainly never feel ""stronger"" after everything that has happened. However, I think it is good for your mental health to not let yourself get beat up for thinking you aren't fighting enough."
1,Thank you for the sanity we desperately need through these fact based videos.
1,Cue the antivaxxer comments asting Kurzgesagt what big pharma payed them -.-
0,"Propaganda.
New RNA-vaccines can be more harmful than the disease itself."
2,another good video
1,I wonder if we’ll ever get a face reveal of Kurzgesagt’s narrator thinking_face
1,"I feel like Kurzgesagt is running out of ideas, they’ve practically made the same video 3times"
1,"Another pro vaccine video, to be honest I am a bit disappointed to see kurzgesagt grow into this. I love a lot of the videos that you make and you have inspired me a lot. But about vaccines? It is easy to minimize the negative effects or call those being affected outliers by throwing numbers and statistics until they are someone close to you. I cannot count how many times I heard from my friends that their life is forever changed because of under-tested vaccines.

 I am sorry to say that promoting vaccines without talking about the risks of taking them in detail, is not a stance that I would support, vaccines should be much safer than what they currently are before being used on the mass public."
1,"If only this video was here 2 years ago, if only...."
1,Why the cytokines thick
1,Good idea on the title rename - I skipped it last time and scoffed.
1,that is why taking fever suppression drugs its a bad idea in most cases like a normal fever
1,funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
1,Should talk about how tuberculosis is coming back
1,"...But There's a REAL question i'd want answering.
There are people in this world whose brains are wired in such a way that means they have a severe adversion to needles and the like, either it'd be from past trauma or those on the Altistic spectra, and simply cannot get vaccines via needles; simply because it is mind over matter in this case and cannot affect their own state of mind properly. (I'm one of them, by the way.)
I Love your videoes, and its amazing to hear about these things. However, is there any hope for people like me to stay safe against really deadly diseases?"
1,"Really? All of this just for you to tell to take vaccines and talk about climate change in the end? Give us real advice! 
Foods to eat, exercise, habits to pick up??"
1,"When I was a smoker, I didn't die of a compromised immune system.
Now I am not a smoker, and I haven't died of a compromised immune system.
Conclusion: I am invincible!"
1,It's even worse when you have an auto immune disease :)
1,"Kurgesagt, I can freely admit that you guys make the best Science videos on YouTube."
1,Why just post this in the middle of nowhere I don't even know the immune system
1,Crazy aggressive chimps with machine guns. Imagine face_with_tears_of_joy. I have always loved the analogies you guys used.
1,"""What doesn't kill you, makes you weak and easy prey for scavengers."""
1,"Vaccines are good

But i have my concerns about mRNA vaccines
Especially the rushed covid vaccines that cause heart inflammation"
1,Another Soros lie spiced with the truth. Don't forget to give them money
1,"If you need so much energy when you're sick, then why do you lose your appetite instead of getting more hungry?"
1,"I love theese videos and i trust in the effects of vaccines, but isnt it like kinda forced by kurzgesagt at this point ??? Like i know many people still    are antivax but you guys are talking about them in every video about health condicions"
1,is this cells at work
1,Why does the body make scar tissue instead of proper tissue? Limited resources?
1," *Your Immune system is a jerk*
Someone needs to make an out of context."
1,This episode is sponsored by.......................................................Pfizer
2,"Soooo to boost our immune system we shouldn’t try and remain strong, fit and healthy we should just shoot up vaccines….. yeah cool….."
1,I do love training my immune system by taking vaccines below the bridge
2,first ez
1,This video had to be published in 2020...
1,I’m currently very sick and the fact that my body is breaking down my muscles to fight this disease is extremely depressing. Put blood sweat and tears into gaining muscle as a skinny guy and now its goingcrying_face
1,So what your saying is I'm built different
1,"One thing I have heard ( haven’t fact checked so take this with a grain of salt) is that some virus like measles can actually kill your memory cells, so after the infection is gone you actually lose some of your past immunity, which is why one needs to get additional vaccine shots after measles infection."

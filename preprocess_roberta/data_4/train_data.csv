this is the earliest I've ever watched a kurzgesagt video before, too bad I have to sleep, so I'll continue it tomorrow."
2,Amazing video! Love y'all! Keep it up!

1,Anti-Vac parents should watch this before making a decision that could've affected their childdren's entire life
1,Would be cool to see a pregnancy video and what it does to the body over the months. Because being pregnant also lowers your immune system.
1,I really like the analogy of infections being like wars with collateral damage. I learn so much from this channel!
1,"I think long Covid has proven that, if you can avoid it, not getting sick in the first place is best."
1,"Older self? I'm good if I make it to see my grandkids. I did my job at that point, I'm ok to go at that point.

Thank you so much Kurzgesagt Institute"

1,We are meant to *resist disease for a reason. Just because disease can strengthen your immune system doesn’t mean you should be happy to be sick. You can still have an amazing great immune system but die at the age of 60
1,Speaking of vaccines. When are you gonna make a video about Pfizer lying about their vaccine and how they tricked people into thinking it was safe.
1,Compare everything to amish people.
1,The best way to achieve natural immunity is to drink the juice that leaks out of the dumpster behind a 7-11
1,Is she pregnant?
1,"This video is lying about natural immunity, you get more protection from catching a disease and recovering than a vaccine."
1,"Sadly, this is propaganda. I would imagine that the funds that paid for this video more than likely came directly from Pfizer or a big Pharma in general or perhaps Bill Gates and cell. I thoroughly enjoy the videos of Chris Cassatt but this one is a bit disappointing. Thank you. Keep up the good work though."
1,"Hey Phillip, I read Immune and it was absolutely incredible. Since you and your team seem so passionate about climate change (and it is a really important topic), you should think about writing a book on climate change, I would be ecstatic."
1,Primary Progressive multiple sclerosis sucks because of this
2,Respect the camera man for this
1, Wait...The coronavirus did more damage to young people than older ones? i thought it was the other way
0,What doesn’t kill you mutates and try again
1,Since you took the magic poison vax your immune system is now dead... The antichrist is soon to come and Jesus is coming back soon. Wake up
1,Kurzgesagt may just prove that we're in the best timeline!
1,Awesome video! A perfect mix between facts and knowledge and fun/wholesome animations. Thank you for the great video and all the effort that goes into it! red_heart
1,my immune system tried to kill me last year so now i beat it into submission with immune system suppressing drugs
1,"Cmon guys, individual carbon footprint offset? in 2023? Are you kidding?

This is some corporate propaganda if you truly believe the climate crisis can be approached individually still, I thought we were way past that. Don't be on the wrong side of history."
1,"Man it has been awhile since your last vid, welcome back :D"
1,"No one should watch this channel, it is a propaganda producer for billionaires, this information is not reliable!!!!! please unsub asap like i just did. Bill Gates/big pharma basically owns this channel"
1,"Dude, wouldn't it be lit if Kurzgesagt dropped an animated series all about LitRPGs? Like, seriously, it would be epic to see some sick graphics and badass characters leveling up."
0,What I learned from this video is that my body commits war crimes on a massive scale every day.
1,"While your body is busy with the vaccine, is not weaker to other opportunist infections?"

1,"Aw, I love the design of the little puppet person"
1,Animation has gotten unbelievable.
1,"Here's my problem: I trust and believe in vaccines, but not in the companies that produce them. Pretty much every single one that worked on Covid Vaccines came out with iffy confessions over time. By the time I can figure out the pros and risks of any vaccine, I've probably gotten sick waiting for results."
1,"On call- Sir I want to report, I saw a human in Kurzgesagt's Videosaluting_face"
1,the same minute i woke up
1,My mom dad and sister tested positive and got covid and i tested negative and didnt get it and we all live together
0,Fuck you and your vaccine. I will never watch this fucking channel ever again.
1,Brought to you by Pfizer. :)
1,"You discussed what a traditional vaccine is, and that's great. But you didn't explain the Covid vaccine, and how it works completely differently and is actually the reason the virus mutated so fast, people are being diagnosed with massive clots, and myocarditis and dropping dead from physical exertion. If you dont know these details, the paper dojo actually has a bomb in it that could go off at any time, or not at all. Understand your dojo, and choose wisely."
1,Can you make a video of one of the biggest pandemic among living beings (Avian Influenza)?
1,"There has been some evidence that showed that natural immunity to Covid 19 was better than vaccine immunity. I believe its still being investigated, so to flat across the board say that vaccine immunity is better is probably not correct."

1,Kurzgesagt has taught me so much about the Immune system
1,"hi l am from Philippines
and meet me at "
1,Thanks for this. A lot of people seem to be confused about this topic. I do wish there were a mention of some diseases that disable or weaken your immune system such as Covid. Meaning you can get reinfected with a disease.
1,"Does anyone think, they need to make a game?"
1,I have always been vulnerable to common cold and wasn't able to get a covid vaccine and then I caught it three times. Fortunately survived all of them somehow most of the time using only painkillers. One time got antibiotics. Amazingly surprised. Not suggesting anyone to try it out like me. One never knows get vaccinated peeps.
1,The background music in this one is fantastic
1,Can you please do a vid on how a certain vaccine can incite an immune response on the heart? There are a few more young people these days with less that ideal tickers. Thanks.

1,"Had to go back to this video and comment again now that covid vaccines are banned in the US. This video makes your channel look pretty non credible, and I would suggest deleting it. I am all for standard vaccines we have developed over decades, but this is clearly old propaganda from a burnt out covid campaign. I am unsubscribed indefinitely."

1,"Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.

He is loving but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.

1,Down-voting for the carbon offset ad nonsense... Aren't you the ones who constantly touts the research you spend hundreds of hours on? Sounds like your corporate overlords couldn't look into it for more than two seconds when they were presented a sponsorship opportunity. I lost a lot of respect for Kurzgesagt today.

1,"Hello angry commenter about to post about vaccines.
You are funny, and yes, the information here isnt exactly true, after all it is a simplification. ""Vaccines are bad cuz agenda and mind control and etc."" Nope, you are being pretty much gaslighted and consuming misinformation. Vaccines are made for your inmune system and that's it. They do not interact with the brain directly. The mayority of your sources (or the common ones that spread this kinds of lies) are just spreading misinformation for fun, to create histeria, or because they have been influenced by others, just like you. 
Please, im begging, don't trust everything you see in the internet, and remember: a lie repeted 1000 times becomes the truth."
1,"Or we can abandon bad fossil fuel sources and renewables and greatly expand our nuclear power and invest heavily in nuclear fusion and maybe even get started on sending probes to mercury where we can get ready for making a Dyson sphere.

2,Great video and loved the graphics beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,"I found the title a bit misleading. I was expecting some tips on what you can do yourself to boost your immume system. Ice baths or whatever. Instead, this is a promotion video for vaccines. Don't get me wrong, vaccines are great, but I was expecting something else by the title."
2,"So, Sending messages to that system, is safe ?!"
1,Sorry I can't come in today my body has switched into a wartime economy
2,Another piece of great reset
1,What your telling us is what I also think because I wouldn't call the body one thing there is a lot of tiny organisms inside and that's why I think it's like a battle but your body may adapt this to have a better warning system

1,Except some vaccines like tho Covid Vaccine were made too quickly without any time to seriously test it for long term health defects before it went out to the public.  Not millions of people are beginning to see what those defects were and it's not good.
1,"Honestly thank you so much for this video. I get really frustrated with the idea of ""immunity debt"" conspiracies about covid, the idea that not getting sick makes your immune system weaker to new viruses. It doesn't make sense with the way the immune system is set up.

Vaccine scaremongering is genuinely so frustrating to deal with and these videos help a lot"
1,Nature dungeon is like either easy bosses you can get or you're fucking 0 to death by one or multiple viruses... and if you didn't heal propelly it's even more bs. Nature really holds the cup for being the top force on the planet.
1, yeah and lets not mention muscle memory to discourage people from improving themselves
1,"So how come people who take the Covid vaccine are developing high blood pressure, getting heart attacks and strokes, etc? Maybe they’re not as great as we think they are."
1,I really want to see the retention graph for this video and see what happens when he started talking about vaccines
1,"This was an extremely weak video. I'm all for vaccines and science, but these PA holier than though videos do no good."
1,I obsessively wash my hands and keep a neat and mostly healthy diet to keep my immune system ready to go.

3)not eating too much junk food or oily food
4)drinking water from time to time or whenever I feel to

1,"Why aren't the immune cells yellow and blue, with the invaders painted with white, blue and red stripes?"
1,"Your immune system, when it's not manipulated isn't dangerous"
1,"Expected a bit more from Kurzgesagt. Felt like a deja vu but no, you already've made a really similar video on vaccines. What I think was missing:

- More information about variability in response and risk factors - that older people have weaker response to flu and should consider the vaccine while younger people will likely get the same severity symptoms for both flu vaccine and infection and it's more about time preference. 

-Why It's important for vaccines to be accessible across the world - at least for at-risk people. (Flu and even covid vaccines often not available in poor countries.) Why it only makes sense for vaccines to be public domain (Like Oxford vaccine almost was before astra zenneca stole it - still can't believe public allowed that to happen and decided to light phone towers on fire instead...)"
1,wait so if there are millions of bacteria on your nails can you bite them to boost your immune system?
1,"I'm so grateful for my body, I legitimately cannot remember when last I was ill. I feel like I got lucky, that being said I used to eat dirt/random things and play outside as a kid 24/7."

1,Not a vaccine though.

1,"It's disgusting how blatantly you're carrying water for the COVID jab. Why don't you do a video on why the jab isn't a fucking vaccine? Or didn't you know that they changed the definitions of ""vaccine"" in 2021 to include mRNA gene therapy shots?"

1,"When i first saw the title of this video the thing that came to my mind was ""auto immune disease"" finally They covered it. But was highly disappointed that you guys just gave basic intro to immune system which i believe you guys have already done. Wish you guys had explained auto immune disease instead and how immunity can actually be a biggest enemy that mankind has faced till now. There is high belief that disease like diabetics or even dementia might be related to auto immune disease. As a person whose family has history of auto immune disease it has haunted me since my childhood. With the food we eat that leads to chronic inflammation triggers auto immune disease. So, this needs a dire publicity so people can avoid it."

No separating between traditional vaccines and experimental mRNA vaccines"
1,Use to love this channel but they went all in for the covid vaccines and now trying to dig themselves out by saying a covid vaccine is a vaccine. It is not a traditional vaccine. It changes how we respond to the connection of the covid virus. A pollo vaccine does give your immune system a “dojo” like training. But don’t be fool by clever animation and vague analogies. This organization is being funded by big pharma. And let me prove it to you with a simple income report they publicly offer. Good day my fellow inquisitors of the difficult to understand.
1,"To be honest, i feel like the immunue system is inefficient despite its powerful defense.
For one, i think making it so that we become hungrier when we feel sick instead of siphoning energy out of the digestive system is better. In fact i think the digestive system should get boosted while in this state so that disgested food will be able to turn to ""war materials"" faster.
I am not an expert at this field and thus i bet there's gonna be someone who will point out how this is impossible or what the limits are, these are just my thoughts."

1,"I remember last year when I got the flu I was really tired but couldn’t fall asleep because my nose was so congested, or my throat was so sore, that I couldn’t get comfortable enough to fall asleep. Not much anyway. So yeah, that sucked! :’D"
1,yeah everybody get the covid shots and a booster every year lol. Covid shot is not a vaccine though.
1,But what about if the vaccine hasn't gone through enough testing to know all it's long term side effects? Should we take that vaccine?
1,First 30 seconds tells me all I need to know about this video. Covid propaganda.
1,Except for a Vax that is a experimental one...... that one's no good.....
1,"and at one point, all of these things that we survive would have killed us."
1,"For some reason, the most important detail is constantly overlooked. There is a term viral load, which indicates the number of viral particles that enter the body in a short period of time. A person may encounter a small infection for the first time and the immune system will have the opportunity to respond before the body receives serious damage. But if it a big one - damage from the infection and subsequent damage from the actions of the immune system are likely to be severe or even fatal.

Thus, the vaccine guarantees that the load will be small. However, even if you have ready-made antibodies floating around in your blood, the chance of getting seriously ill or even dying is real if you encounter a high viral load."
1,"You can almost feel the annoyance kurzgesagt has for anti-vax people, every time they talk about it they just pound away at how beneficial (and non-harmful) vaccines are lol"
1,The immune system proves that God exists. how ? because it moves like it has a conscience but cells have no brain brain so something/someone with a conscious is making it operate and that would be God
2,"Yeah ok, give this to me when I'm sick. Sure."
1,"It is funny how the official protection numbers for ""the"" vaccine have exactly one curve. Which never flattened.
Oh yeah. That was the point of the ""stay at home orders."" Why'd that saying disappear so much quicker than the orders?"

Don’t forget that people accidentally get their children killed by disease because they don’t believe in vaccines! GET VACCINATED , keep us all SAFER because of YOUR actions"
1,"And vaccines will make tremendous progress in the next few years for two reasons: mRNA and AI. 

With mRNA, it is no longer necessary to grow attenuated pathogens in the lab or somehow find a way to synthesize their proteins in the lab, we just need to encode a recipe for their protein as mRNA, then our body itself will produce the protein and thus the vaccine, if you give it the mRNA. Because that is what our body does all day long anyway: to produce proteins according to mRNA construction instructions. If a cell wants to have a protein, it looks up how to build it on the DNA in the cell nucleus, creates mRNA building instructions for it and then passes these on to the outside, where enzymes then assemble the required protein on the basis of these building instructions. 

But how do you create such a blueprint? This has been the most difficult part so far, because it is difficult to predict how proteins will fold. This requires elaborate computer simulations that take an extremely long time to try out all possible combinations, but that is changing. As it turns out, you can train an AI to correctly predict this behavior. This means that in the future it will be much faster to let a computer create an mRNA sequence that ultimately leads to exactly one specific protein. Of course, an AI can also make mistakes, but the mRNA is of course first tested in the laboratory and it is ensured that it really builds exactly the desired protein and only this protein. Nevertheless, this is a gigantic time-saver.

In a few years, it will be possible to create effective vaccines for any disease in a few months. Then mankind will divide into two groups: Vaccination opponents, who will behave as irrationally as they did with the Covid vaccines, and those who will be vaccinated against most of the relevant diseases in the world. One of these two groups will then unfortunately become extinct in the long term. But that's good, because various other irrational behaviors will die out with them."
1,Great video with beautiful explanation! But you missed how we can improve our immune system naturally! Vaccines are one way but we should nurture our immune system naturally too
1,Who else read Immune before watching this or will read it now?
1, any more reasons?
1,You failed to mention that the vaccine provides you with a direct biological 5G cellular link up!  You won't need a cellphone any longer!!!!!  -just joking!
1, so the immune system is basically like the avengers fighting in a city
1,"Ok, Bill Gates propaganda channel. You should do a video on the recent increased deaths of ""unknown causes"" around the 4x boosted world."
1, foreshadowing ;)
1,Someone needs to tell my army to stop attacking my lungs it's getting expensive
1,COVID hit me like a mild flu... but damn if I haven't had a persistent runny nose ever since.
2,Getting my 16th booster today!!! Wish me luck!
1,I forgot I was still subscribed to this bill gates propagandist.
0,HIV AIDS sure as hell didn't leave anyone stronger
1,Another takeaway. Is that having reserves in the form of muscles gained from exercise will also help your immune system when push comes to shove.
1,@ The data on the CDCs own website show otherwise.  Video reported for misinformation.
1,Please please do a video on science of misinformation and propaganda

2,Thank you for creating this !! Amazingly explained !!
1,have an amazing day the most complex beings of nature
1,"I have a reference here that might be useful if you want to see what the true power of the immune system can do. In some rare cases, COVID 19 caused cytokine storm responses in some very unlucky individuals. One of these individuals in Chicago actually lost both of their lungs to this cytokine storm in their body and in the lungs taken out, you can actually see the damage each individual in their white blood cells did to their poor lungs. Normally, cells in your body have immune target exemptions, this means that your immune system is not allowed to directly attack your body cells in order to prevent autoimmune damage. During a cytokine storm however, these exemptions are removed from nearly all active immune cells as one of the tricky ways that pathogens can avoid being attacked is by mimicking or stealing your body cell's exemption markers so usually, when a cytokine storm is needed, the immune cells can no longer trust the friendly signals they recieve. I should warn you before giving you the 'google coordinates' that it is very  disturbing if you are squemish, the damage is extensive and not for the faint of heart. 






If you still want to follow along look up ""COVID double-lung transplant"" and click on the picture of what looks like a burned black and pink oval, the lung has almost an L-shaped black burn on the inside side of the lung. First, you can draw your attention to the pink/yellow/red patch which looks like it has bubbles blown into it. This damage comes from peroxides produced primarily by the neutrophils which they then vomit onto intruders. If you have ever used hydrogen peroxide to clean your wounds, you have seen what a low concentration can do (usually ~1%) but, if you aren't unlucky enough to accidentally spill high concentration (~40%) on your skin yet, it really hurts as it burns through everything in its path reducing or dumping electrons onto every chemical they can react with. Extra electrons tend to make most molecules unstable which causes them to break appart into smaller molecules which can be very deadly to anything that is alive as we very much can't tollerate 50-100% of all the chemicals that we are made of breaking appart. The peroxides in your neutrophils are notablely nitrogen-based which doesn't really change their damaging properties, just what they break down into. NO3 can be unstable on its own so it is often bound into things like urea for expulsion by your kidneys but if you have too much, you can get ammonia damage (as the NO3 becomes NH3 spontaneously in fluids in our body).



The second big noticable region is the aformentioned L-shaped burn. These blackened areas are most likely appoptosis (programmed cell death) caused by either CD8 T cells (aka killer T cells) or natural killer cells and are meant to only instruct infected cells to kill themselves in order to prevent further spread of viruses but, during a cytokine storm, everyone is fair game. The final visible marks come in the fuzzy brown/white areas and the patches of red. The patches of red are likely from macrophages bringing too much fluid from the blood through inflammation likely leading to bleeding while the fuzzy areas are complement swarmed cells. As you likely know from in a nutshell videos, complement rips cells open and antibodies can be used to speed up this reaction, all of which are meant to target bacteria and lone virads (single virus units) to shut them down but, once again, in a cytokine storm, everyone is fair game.

This is the true power of your immune system and you should feel very glad that you, unless you have a cytokine storm or an auto immune disorder, will never be in the crosshairs of your own immune system. Sorry for all the misspells but youtube's tought police algorithims will delete half to all of my writing if I spell them right"

1,"Carrying on with the immune theme, it would be great to do a video on original antigenic sin, and other issues that highlight where the immune system isn't as good as it could be and what, if anything, we can do to improve (except vaccines cos you just did it ;) )"

1,This is a topic that never gets old...
1,Nature dojo is more risky *assuming there isn't something wrong with the vaccine which causes a side effect more severe than you will experience facing the disease.
1,"I think the video's great. But the dojo analogy isn't ideal - I think it can be appealing for the super-macho, ""testosterone-boosted"", ""I-can-deal-with-it-myself"" group that often buys into antivax garbage. I'd have rather put it like this: getting vaccinated is like receiving military training, and developing natural immunity is like being thrust into a war zone as a partisan. One of those guarantees way better outcomes than the other, which is simply dangerous."
1,I wasn’t fully paying attention at first and wondered why my frame rate was so bad lol grinning_face_with_sweat
1,"I'm not against vaccines, but I don't like that they only mention this way of boosting your immune system. Doing cold exposure has been proven to be really effective, not eating processed foods and refined sugars, etc. There's plenty other ways to boost your immune system naturally. This feels like being spoon-fed a vaccine by Bill Gates, don't forget Kurzgesagt receives money from the Melinda Gates foundation (they said it themselves). I still love these guys, they've got some great videos, but sometimes they be just working for the interests of my man Bill Gates, and his ""Im a god, so I am allowed to do anything to save the environment"" ideology."

1,"Tldr the title is clickbait and makes you think vaccines are the only solution to all disease if you allow yourself to be mislead


The longer version:

This video is good but I feel its been produced in a slightly misleading way that conflates the damage the immune response does to the body with the immunity provided by the infection in judging the value of a vaccine

The way its presented, it would be very easy to assume vaccines are superior to natural infection because they make you more resistant, this is especially pertinent in regards to the Coronavirus considering it lacks the same lethality of many plagues

Most of the information in this video is good, i'm unsure if they were concerned about dipping their toes in the controversy of the recent pandemic but Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Smallpox etc are unquestionably something that requires a vaccine whereas a common flu is not something which requires one unless you have a health condition or are quite old

Edit: I also realise why this video has me suspicious. It makes no mention of the risks of vaccines, not even the ones in the past that we fixed. It's a lie by ommission and by structure"
2,Great video as always!
1,Something is fishy about the comments.
1,Amazing video again! Very educational
1,"one thing that isnt mentioned in the video is the circumstance when life forces you to experience the 'nature dojo' already. under that circumstance there is no longer a need to go to the 'vaccine dojo' because youve already tested yourself against the disease
there is no reason to get a vaccine for a disease you have already fought and there is no reason to get a booster for a disease youve already fought dont let big pharma tell you otherwise"
1,I got sick more from the Covid vax then Covid itself twice so… just go with natures natural way.

1,"I’m 19, pretty healthy, on day 4 of having covid for the first time, lol it sucks. I’m vaccinated but this is still the sickest i’ve been in years. Blaming a lot of it on the fact I work on an ambulance and am in ERs a lot, so maybe I just got the strain that kills everyone. Either way, covid is way more intense than I thought it would be. And as much as fevers suck to have, I’m glad my body is able to do that. Thank you body."
1,Hey Steve  Taylor
1,"I actually am still kinda scared of my immune system. All is well and I get sick sometimes ect ect. But I have some severe allergies. 
Tried all sorts of treatments, pills and what not but they all have side effects. My sinuses are completely ruined already and I'm still young. I even have the feeling my immune system is working so much overtime on allergens that it's weaker and tired against normal diseases...

1,"I was expecting this video to go into autoimmune diseases as well, but I guess I'll share some facts myself:

So the way your body recognises invaders is by checking the outside of every cell. This is like a fingerprint and unique for every single cell. However, your immune system will only check small parts of this fingerprint. Sometimes you'll get sick and your body marks a certain fingerprint as being harmful, making many many more defenders to attack any cell with that fingerprint. However, sometimes your own body cells have teeny little parts of their fingerprints that look very similar, causing your immune system to start attacking your own cells instead!

So yeah, sometimes getting sick turns your own weapons against you"

1,Way to contradict yourself K team. What a jokeperson_facepalming_light_skin_tone
1,The video made the immune system easy to understand. I'm also glad you explained how vaccinnes work instead of saying everyone should get an experimental vaccine. Also we can all cease carbon emissions but sadly humans aren't the only ones contributing to climate change :(
1,"A vaccine is never stronger than natural immunity. I appreciate pointing out a vaccine is safer to get than the actual virus, but saying vaccines train your body to better combat the virus in the future is false."
1,"Not all vaccines are created equal.
To borrow the dojo analogy, if you're training in a controlled environment, you should be training against real-world scenarios. Training against fictional and overly simplistic opponents leaves one underprepared with a false sense of security.
Case in point, the COVID ""vaccine"" exposes your body to 1 protein that is found on the SARS-Cov-2 virus. The virus has 29 proteins. A natural infection builds an immune response that looks for all of them. The shot does not.
A proper vaccine exposes you to a real-world version of the threat.
Don't trust your life to bad training. Demand that our medical science community stop trying to take shortcuts, and stick to tried and true methods of producing vaccine immunity."
1,What a BS video.
1,Please make a video about auto immune disease.
1,So who paid for this video?
1,"i became sick TODAY this didnt help, specially considering i worked out the whole month trying to gain a bit of muscle..."
1,"In my opinion, while vaccine can be a great way to train your immune system, it is possible to infect other people while you are sick. And yet vaccine doesn't guarantee you anything. You may or may not respond to it well, besides why should you vaccinate when you don't know whether you are gonna be sick with that disease or not. Last year my vaccinated relative gave me Delta variant of Coronavirus as a present on my birthday, without wrong intentions of course. But I will remember it for the rest of my life, as with my strong immune system this was the first time I feared a disease."

1,"So I heard that there are some ""natural vaccines"" that you can do, like biting your fingernails or eating your snot.

I just simply mean that I find simply encouraging the idea as much work as making part of the tech myself though.) But my influence right now is an improvement to the human chassis. Kurzesagt was actually a channel that encouraged my idea of inventing 'human evolution' based on how we built other things in the pursuit of emulating evolution. (Humans gained wings. We don't have wings. We ride wings via plane. Etc.) I hope my cybernetic robot enhancements..... or someone elses if they want to put a silly company behind this, to boost human life by a very artificially enhanced innovation. To continue electrical pulses through neo-organs, made to emulate everything your body does, hooked up to your nerve system."

2,o
1,Natural immunity is superior in my opinion. Kurz did good by mentioning how a vaccine can fail because of the invader mutating. But it also slows your immune response as the vaccine makes your system prepare for the wrong enemy and now is starting further behind in the campaign as opposed to further along as intended. It's hubris to believe we are equal or superior to nature. Of course not everyone is in an ideal state of health. But we must remind people that the most beneficial thing you can do is strive toward building up your health every day. If you don't help yourself no one else will be able to. The human body is a marvel of incredibly complicated systems. We need to humbly honor our role guiding these bodies by being exemplary pilots of such machines. Adaptation is our super power and your mindset will do a lot more than people seem to realize. The placebo and nocebo effects are all documented so this is why I strongly urge people to stay determined toward improvement and prioritize champion mentalities vs ones of a victim.

1,"Not saying most—if not all—of what is presented isn’t true, but this is straight-up propaganda."
1,These comments have been sterilised too!
1,"The very thing this video is promoting could also kill you prematurely. There have been thousands of times in documented history where the media happily and obliviously promoted things that ended up killing and maiming thousands of people. Hundreds of thousands of instances of death caused by unknown drug side effects from something the FDA originally approved of or medical devices that were approved for use on humans then suddenly OOPS our bad that actually can actually kill you. SORRY... There's no accountability with these people so be careful who you listen to. No one on this content creation team went to medical school. They are not qualified to give you medical advice despite pretending to be experts. You end up a ""died suddenly"" obituary, an odd statistical blip, a cautionary tale and the people at kurzgesagt keep pumping out propaganda."
1,And sometimes after the vaccine your heart suddenly stops. Go figure)
1,"RNA covid vaccines don't give you cell memory, it's not like conventional vaccines that infect you with a dead or weakened virus. It just mimics the spike protein of the original strain and forces you to create antibodies that do not last and become less effective on newer spike proteins. If this is a response to anti-vaxers, it needs to acknowledge this fact."
1,"Never had the flu but idk if it was COVID or the flu got super sick for two days so when I do get sick which is very rare I hide under my blanket to heat up and it usually goes away fast 2 days was a new record for me I never take medicine cause of past trauma but I took meds that was the worst I have ever felt 
I was around a ton of people that got COVID but never caught from them"

2,I wish this video had been uploaded in 2020.

1,He changed the title didn't he. What was it before?
1,I feel like I got dumber from this video
1,This is a matter of Hearts of Iron IV. gameplay
1,"Oh no.  You're not gonna start changing your video titles and thumbnails around every few days, chasing the algorithms are you ?...  This is an incredibly annoying trend.  You've got 20M+ subscribers.  Is that really necessary ?"
1,Oh eff off with the offsetting carbon footprint bs
1,"I was 7 in 2015, it was Halloween, it was cold and raining. Mom told me not to go trick or treating, but naturally, I didn't listen. Got a cold. A bad cold. A really bad cold. I was having a fever of 104 every night and was sweating bullets while sleeping. Went to ER, and the doctors had no idea what was going on. Was diagnosed with JIA at the start of the new year 2016. Went into remission for around a year but then got sick again. Came out of remission in a new country while on vacation away from my meds. Flew back to the US with a fever of 105 on the plane. Not fun at all. Was ab to go into remission but I was diagnosed with MAS a month ago. Macrophage Activation Syndrome. A new autoimmune disease to beat. I'm doing better but was in the hospital for the first two weeks of February. My white blood cells hate me. Life is tough but you have to work through it, I was dealt a terrible hand but I'm super thankful for my incredible support net of family and friends. I'm back at school now which may seem to be a bad thing but I'm a level 10 extrovert so talking to people keeps me sane. Doing better now which is awesome! Honestly loving my life.

TL;DR: going trick or treating turns out to be the worst mistake of my life, now I have 2 crippling autoimmune diseases and my back will hurt for the rest of my life. Doing better now tho."
1,"your name literally mean ""in a nut shell - in a nut shell"""
2, Best legal mind I ever knew
2,Your videos are so good and knowledgeable
1,Please continue to make these videos
2,Thank God for creating all this. exploding_headfolded_hands
1,I am the man
2,Wish we had a vaccine against covid
1,I thought you were going to talk about autoimmune diseases
1,Wow Pfizer gene therapy commercial after all the new data suggests how damaging it was. Good job Kurzgesagt!!!
1,"""Your immune system is a jerk""
As someone with Crohns disease, I can wholeheartedly agree."
2,"When a vaccine is effective, it's great to take."
1,I had a fever for the past week and u upload this video wow
1,Natural immunity is better than vaccines immunity.
1,This was the best Defense Against The Dark Arts class I've ever seen!
1,What happens to your body when you diet? What is the process your body goes through to get rid of excess fat cells. Is there such a thing as bad weight loss?
1,Only real ones remember the old thumbnail and title name.
1,If our body goes into conservation mode to fuel the immune response for fighting off illnesses why does exercising while sick make you feel better faster?
0,Watching the video during illness and feeling sleepy as i lost energy
1,"If it wasn’t for Kurzgesagt, I would not understand about half of science"
1,Where can I buy the Kurzgesagt-med study tool/library. I’ll take on another loan
1,Why is Kurzgesagt recently so indecisive on their titles and thumbnails lol
1,Wow! What an interesting video! I really like the analogies and the explanations about how the human body defends itself. That bit about how the body digests it's own muscle as a way of conserving energy when it is sick really resonated with me and made me want to build more muscle : ) Even though I'm already kind of a stud ; P
1,Bro I’m learning more in this video that I did in 2 years of school
1, what is this graph??
1,Immune system protects you against the lab created virus of covid
1,Who here has always wanted to play the body video game that the narrator always seems to be playing to test out all these different results of sickness? It looks so freaking cool I’m jealous
1,regarding the refrigerant bit at the end... I think you should look into revising that. Because new refrigerant is always being developed. Cars don't use R12 anymore. Most cars use R134a which is just as bad as carbon dioxide and many manufacturers are switching to R1234yf which is even less bad for the environment than carbon dioxide. Eventually all cars will use R1234yf as refrigerant for their air conditioning systems.
1,"I think I understood something. Our immunity must be a really complicated thing, since videos about it keep coming out on your channel! But I must admit, they always turn out to be interesting. It is interesting to listen to what is inside each of us. We are an incredible miracle of nature, and you understand this only in those moments when you think about such things as immunity. By the way, I have not been sick for many years and I have no idea why this is happening. It's so weird...although I'm not complaining. Just wondering why this is happening.grinning_face_with_sweat"
1,This video is promoting the corona virus vaccines in an irresponsible way without mentioning the high rate of severe side effects and the low effectiveness of the vaccines!
1,"Our body cells is like a monster, always try to kill us but at the same time forcing us to live"
1,Cool but I ain't getting the covid vaccine. Shit don't even work that good
1,flushed_face
1,Kurzgesagt needs to make a video game someday. That would be so cool!
1,"another awesome video! She popularizes superbly well! beautiful, attractive, educational and important video! thank you very much for your work!
you so deserve to be known worldwide!"
1,"I thought it was some sort of science explained, not Pfizer promotional campaign! .... All that was missing, was Trudeau in a Special-Guest-Star appearance."
1,IM SO EARLYYYY HELLOO KRUZGESAGT I LOVE YOUR VIDS MUCH LOVEsparkling_heartsparkling_heart
1,"This is a rather terrible video across the board. It's largely vaccine-pandering to people who already believe in them. Those who don't believe in them won't be convinced, because you don't address the core points of their current anti-vax movement. Namely: they don't believe in the COVID vaccine in particular because it was rushed, comes with a lot more side-effects than previous vaccines, is less effective than previous vaccines (e.g. see Measles chart in video), scientific review of it was largely silenced in the name of political headwinds, and studies have been overwhelmingly showing that natural immunity is superior to vaccinated immunity for the particular case of COVID given its rapid rate of mutation.

On top of that, the ""ad"" in this video is all about ""carbon footprint"" which itself is Big Oil propaganda with the intent to offload blame onto the individual despite individuals being a rounding error.  

A real shame, too."
0,"Sooo, similar to police brutality?"
1,"Thanks to Kurzgesagt we know how the body works, but what do over the counter drugs do to the immune system? Panadol, Nurofen, Codeine ect."
1,red_heart
1,Is this for the next COVID strain that's been worked on by your billionaire friends?
1,"Well at least nature dojo isn’t owned by some pharma that tells to he government what to do, at the end the choice is nature kills you or government do it faster in the dojo Ofc !"
1,That was so coolsmiling_face_with_heart-eyes
1,"I’m a huge supporter but gave this one a dislike since it was very misleading. Vaccines are a great tool to fight disease, but the jury is 100% still out on the Covid vaccines. This just comes across as Pfizer propaganda imo. Especially the part about vaccines being safer than nature, which is true for most vaccines. However, Covid shots appear to be causing the same issues as acute Covid in some."
1,"It should be noted that the main Covid ""vaccines"" were not vaccines in the traditional sense of providing a dose of weakened, dead, or simulated pathogens. They operate on a totally different mechanism and shouldn't really be thrown in with the rest."
1,Will taking medicines when I'm sick will effect the immunological memory of my cells?
1,I am just about to get well again after an encounter with the flu. It was influenza type B. It’s been 10 days. I just lied on my bed for all that time - rooting for my immune system:)
1,"Oh shit, that made me a little bit anxious, because I've been constantly sick since november '22: at first Covid, then the flu, a bacteria infection and currently Covid again... I'm 25 and except from asthma I'm in good health. I don't know why my body can't manage to get better... Anyone else with this problem?"
1,"Been a fan since Markiplier shouted you out, grown up with your videos in school as well. The Uk is currently undergoing a massive cost of living crisis (as im sure the rest of the world is) but i was wondering if you could do a video on a possibility of a hopeful outcome.  I have lost hope of a nice future even if we solve global warming, you're hopeful video on global warming kept me going when i thought it was all hopeless, I hope you can do it again. Sending my love to the team, so proud of where you are."
1,thumbs_up
1,"this channel is sponsored by bill gates and cannot be trusted.
im unsubscribing."
1,Might wanna mention that this is how traditional Vaccines work but not MRNA vaccines; since you used Covid as an example
1,"Wont catch this channel talking about physical activity and proper levels or vitamins and minerals to bossy your immune system. So disappointed in this channel, used to be amazing."
1,"The number of worldwide diseases may eventually reach zero, UNLESS idiot conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers destroy the positive public image of vaccines that science has worked for over a century to build up. People should not believe supposed ""science"" spouted by morons on Twitter. They are not doctors, they do not have the ""inside scoop,"" and you are equally a moron if you fall for them. Believe in actual science done by people who are educated in the facts."
1,"Why that character you are showing is fat, are you promoting being fat and unhealthy through your knowledging videos."
1,"sad to see what is becoming of this channel. the quality of your ""sponsors"" undermines your integrity. hope you will recover."
1,"My parents both work at a hospital that treats Covid patients, and my entire family has taken it seriously ever since we first hard of the outbreak back in 2020.

We made sure that we got all our vaccinations and booster shots in the event that we do get infected by the virus. My parents, being over 60 years old, got sick after taking the vaccines, but the symptoms were mild and it took perhaps one sick day before recovering and getting back to work. My siblings and I, each of us around 20 years of age and no major physical ailments at the time, had little to no adverse side effects from the vaccine.

A few months ago, my dad tested positive for Covid-19, so he immediately self-quarantined in the basement of the house, where he can be relatively isolated from the rest of the family. My siblings were out of the house at the time to attend college, so it’s just me and my parents in the house at the time.

Despite our best efforts to minimize contact with my dad when we delivered food and other necessities to him, my mom and I ended up testing positive for Covid a few days after he did. I’m not sure how sick my parents got, but one day I ended up with a fever and a severe headache. For that one painful day, which if recall correctly was on a Sunday, I was essentially bedridden, sleeping through most of daytime since I didn’t have the energy or even the thought to do anything else.

Fortunately, that one day was the worst of it. At the advice of my mother, whose word I can trust since she’s a RN (meaning Registered Nurse), each of us self-quarantined and isolated ourselves from each other for about a week. Luckily by the time my mom and I were showing symptoms, my dad had fully recovered and so he was the one delivering the food to us. About midway though my week of self-quarantine following the day when my symptoms were at their worst, I tested negative for Covid. I returned to school the following week, and aside from having to wear a regular mask and a lighthearted joke from a friend in reaction to that, everything went back to normal.

As someone who recovered from Covid-19, a lot of the content in this video and the vaccine video really resonated with me, and I can easily relate to not being able to do anything while feeling sick. I’m thankful that the worst I got was just one day of relatively minor symptoms, and that my parents and I recovered with little to no lasting damage. I’ve heard about Covid patients who had what Kurzgesagt often describes as “a really bad time,” some needing to be hospitalized with severe, possibly even life-threatening symptoms. Hopefully the Covid-19 pandemic, along with all variants of the virus, will truly become a thing in the past, yet still taken as a vital lesson on how to properly handle infectious disease outbreaks in the future. Keep up the good work, Kurzgesagt!"
1,"I am no vaccine denier. I got it the second it was available for me, also the boosts. But it took 1 year and a half for me to get it. How can we rely on vaccine as the ""best way"" to boost our immune system if there are geopolotical, capitalist and racist barriers in the way. 
Great video and I will talk to my doctor about the influenza vaccine for 2023. However, if there are so many sacrifices our body does in the nature dojo, can we at least go prepared? If we loss muscles, how much excercise will help us during the sickness. If our digestive system slows down, how should we eat? There are many ""best ways"" to boost our immune if vaccines are not an option. That´s just the world we live in: the north and south, the rich and the poor."
1, what the heck is this graph
1,I learned so much from this video. I never considered what scar tissue is but now I know. Thank you Kurzgesagt.
1,"Did you guys really say vaccines protect you better than getting the actual disease and beating it? 
I’m calling bullshit on that one!"
1,"Nice, more vaccination propaganda.
I know what a vaccine is, there have been plenty of vaccines that have stopped harmful viruses.
But the COVID vaccine? Yeah no, it wasn't made to save lives, it was made to make money, control the masses, and bring more harm then good.
This would be an alright video, if the COVID vaccine wasn't the topic of these past years."
1,"I find it fascinating how on a macrocosm we do indeed function in very much the same way, as you pointed out with your analogy of an invasion. Given what's going on next door to me in Ukraine, observing how the UAF responded to the invasion, it looked a lot like an immune response from the body."
1,"I see that Kurzgesagt learned from their past mistakes and show their sponsers openly, and explain why they took them as sponsers.
You don't just hide the problem, but you fixed it. Paired with the statement on reddit, you guys did a great job."

1,"Wow, I've been a follower, supporter and admirer of your channel for years. This is the 1st video that makes me think you are no longer neutral and are corrupt. I did believe you still held the torch for impartial knowledge that drove goodness in the world. This is the 1st video I have seen that shows differently. Have you corrupted your entire ethos? This video is a fleeting, over generalised commentary piece on vaccines that only just reinforces the Covid Vaccine authoritarian totalitarian agenda  initiative over the past few years. The concept ""vaccine"" is not synonymous to the recent Covid vaccine but you have portrayed it all to be equal. The official Government data doesn't support its continued use for under 60s as one point. There is no data to support Covid vaccinating children another point. This video has made me loose all respect for you as a source of unbiased and authoritative information. I'm loosing all faith in society now that the likes of you have sold out!"
1, - “Imagine crazy aggressive Slippin Jimmies with law degrees.”
0,so you're telling me that there are war crimes going on in my body
2,"Funny, i got this video while sick of my stomach. Hope this helps haha!"
2,Best thing for your immune system is colostrum
1, you can say that Cytokines are among us
1,"Haha y'all changed the thumbnail recently, didn't ya?
Nothing wrong with that by any means, but I noticed when I had this video in my downloads for weeks without watching it (though, I did download it since I believe that counts as a view) and suddenly I see it and go, ""Wait.. this is new?"""
1,what difference is there between a memory b cell and a memory t cell
1,ONLY person to get more than 2k Comments in less than an hour is this guy.
1,"How about the recent studies that show natural immunity is more effective than covid vaccine? Or that because we decided to force vaccinate during a pandemic, it caused it to mutate as fast as it did?"
1,"all well and good, if the companies producing the vaccines actually have the populaces best interests at heart, and haven't been corrupted by some elite dictocrat or conglomerate who's ""Final solution"" is to either make you dependant on vaccine boosters... or damage your immune response through products designed to harm you and marketed as vaccines"
1,So if natural immunity is not as good as a vacine why are they now saying the covid vacine is not as good as a natural one??? Can you address that?
1,Bill gates was divorced because of his affiliation with Epstein. Cut your relations with gates and his foundations. You can get along fine without it. But it being involved with our content puts alot of people off for real.
1,amazing people with Auto immunity is probably fuming right now and including the geniuses it's like a dummy guide and how to be smart
1,I wonder how this content would look if it wasn't funded by extremely wealthy people
1,sponsored by Pfizer
1," I don't know a single young person who was young healthy and died from Covid, only ones who already had respiratory issues"
1,"Like the video, but you really should do a deep dive in the difference between legacy vaccines and the new MRNA technology."
1,"Such a surprisingly superficial, uneducational video team at Kurgesaght, it was mostly repeats of information followed by basically a single fact that everybody generally knows. 

I'm disappointed in the low standards of this video.

You at least could've actually given more evidence-based therapies & preventative measures that people don't already know about."
1,"I wish you would have included more ways to boost the immune system. Such as Vitamin-D, working out, hormone management, weight management, etc.

I still liked the video but only recommending vaccines edges very close to being clickbait."
1,Did the starting animation girl just pee on a snake?
1,Should have clarified between vaccines and MRNA editing tech. Now you have chosen a spectrum...
1,Beautifully explained
1,"Every dumb commenter here watched one video about their sponsors and cant even think for themselves anymore. Having a sponsor doesnt mean youre now propoganda, you absolute morons. Kurzgesagt still has the final say in what gets in the video"
0,Friendly Fire will not be tolerated
2,Vaccine is good but not from Pfizer
1,Please make a video on autoimmune diseasesfolded_handsfolded_handsfolded_handsfolded_hands
1,This turned from an informative video to a Covid vaccination ad really quickly lol
1,Talking about how your immune system is dangerous and not mentionning auto-immune diseases and allergies is such a missed opportunity
1,"I remember watching an expose video a couple of weeks ago about how Kurzgesagt is being used as a political tool by corps like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (and how it shows that most of Kurz's citations come from sources under their umbrella that aren't immune to bias, especially when it comes to subjects like vaccines and green energy), and it was fairly scary.
But the information is still useful, well-presented, comprehensive, and easy to understand. So whatever. Even if the sources can be biased, they're _still_ generally in the spirit of human progress. A higher tide floats all ships."
1,My immune system goes autoimmune if I get the flu shot and has a high chance to kill Me
1,Cytokines looks very off...
2,Thank you sparkling_heart
1,I have read your “immune” book it was amazing and fantastic .And it was very knowledgeable.
1,Very interesting was to explain a health problem. One can try Amritadi guggul from Planet Ayurveda to improve their immunity.

1,"The only real but.... to vaccines is of course that good old random chance issue. Some people's bodies really do fair better in the wild than in the training room cuz as Kurz said, your immune system is a jerk. Remember everyone is unique, So some of the stuff in the vaccine design the help might kill you instead. But vaccines are designed to be helpful overall for most of the population. Basically, just means do your research before getting vaccinated and avoid thinking that they should be mandatory as again as stated there not miracle drugs."
0,"Sponsored by fake, untested vaccines designed to profit off the poor and the dumb?"
2,"Wow OK_hand so well explained, thanks a lot folded_hands"
1,"There are actually 8 pages of side effects, over 2000 in all."
1,I got vaccinated against covid and then I still got covid hopefully my immune system will be ready next time...
1,"vaccines are good, the covid vax isnt"
1,"Only problem with this video, is that vaccines aren't the ONLY way to help work your immune system. Nor are all vaccines made equal. Some aspects of it were touched on but I feel that it wasn't sufficient. Intaking better nutrition and specific nutrition helps you train far better and is a neutral choice between the two dojo types. Zinc, Vitamin D, etc go a looong way."
2,"Great video !
Unfortunately half of comments are from people that are against coronavirus vaccines lol"
1,"Oh of course now that the truth is coming out about the covid ""vaccines"" this shill ass channel gets bought out by big pharmaceutical companies to sell a product.

Shameful and disgusting 

Been with yall since the beginning but this is the final straw."
1,"stop changing your names of your videos 30 minutes after they release, you work on these for months in advance why change them now?"
1,Why is the sponsor Wren based in Colombia?
1,"I think in regard to vaccines you should specify the differences among them. The covid vaccine works differently than the flu vaccine, for example."
1,"So.. the biceps get smaller, and triceps get bigger"
1,Love how you change the title and the thumbnail just to get more clicks
1,As somebody with Crohn's...I can confirm
1,**people with auto immune diseases** eyemoutheye
1,"These animations are amazing, thanks to everyone who works hard to make these videos possible."
1,Can you explain dangers of mRNA vs Protein vaxx? Because not every type is the same..
1,"Those animations have improved a lot and the pixel animation! Great one, Kurzgesagt team! red_heart  and that monkey do be eating that virus"
1,In the case of covid it's been well established now especially in the last month that natural immunity is better than the jabbed version.
2,"When I was a kid I licked hand railings now I’m fine! 

( please don’t lick hand railings.)"
1,"I usually love the animations of the videos, this one is not a exception, however the code at  going up instead of down made me rage lol"
1,"Before watching, I already brace myself for an existential crisis... xD"
1,"Vaccine induced immune response is better than natural one, IN EVERY CASE, EVEN FOR YOUNG PEOPLE? In a nutshell, goodbye"
1,"It's strange that in a video about the immune system and how to improve it, there isn't one mention of excersice and healthy diets..."
1,"Another great video, but once again knowing who's behind the channel financially speaking trully change how I see what you're saying..."
1,"I have had pneumonia once when I was younger, ever since then I’ve needed an inhaler for breathing difficulties that have been left over"
1,So many people in the comments watching conspiracy videos on the toilet think they know more than actual scientists.
1,basically another civilization on our body
1,"Well, this was scary. I didn't know my organs are covered with battle scars."
1,There's no way a vaccine that targets a single protein is more effective than your immune system acquiring natural resistance to a whole suite of the proteins that make up a given virus.
1,"This is a real smart roundabout way of advocating vaccine utilization lol. I’m not personally against it but it does really seem like this was primarily about vaccines, not primarily “boosting your immune system” so perhaps the title should have reflected that."
1,"Oh no - I hate to use the words, but carbon footprint is not something that could save us. You are using exactly the same words as fossil fuels energy producers. This ad was painful to watch, because I always perceived you as an individuals caring for humanity. Now you're just another corporation driven by profits. And I feel sorry now for buying your merch. I'm deeply disappointed."
1,There is one major lie. The immunes you get from a vaccine ARE NOT better than the ones you get from natural infection. It's also ironic you use Covid as the example when it's coming out with the scientific community the MAJOR issues with the vaccine and the lack of danger the actual virus really was.
2,I feel like this video was made with Anti-Vaxxers in mind. Nice job Kurzgesagt. Too bad some people are too stubborn for their own good.
2,I love this channel
1,I'm very dubious about your claim that vaccines give greater future protection than actually getting the disease
2,I love how she has a pet duck or bird or chick
1,Our body has some massive flaws ngl
1,I forgot about my vaccination and now you reminded me of that. Thanks a lot!
0,War is incredibly profyiable for the weapons industry that owns ametica!
1,"Finally, a new video."
1,"My immune system has always been strong. I survived a horrible rsv infection as a baby and basically brushed off the flu, and other than that I have never really gotten sick.
When I was vaccinated for covid, I was tested for antibodies months later and had 4 times the normal amount for it. Unfortunately, it was *such* a strong response that I now have a new autoimmune disease (the vaccine did NOT give it to me, essentially just triggered it). Dermatomyositis at 21 is not fun, it causes muscle atrophy. For a bit I was so weak I couldn't stand up, and the medication and stress made over half of my hair my fall out. My risk of cancer is insane now, because I was already a high risk before. My immune system literally has gifted kid syndrome.

And yeah, I got covid anyways. (So I guess we all know what I'm specifically weak to lmao)"
1,I didn’t take Covid vaccine and my mum got corona and I still didn’t get Covid face_with_tears_of_joy and I’m 8 Cary young and Covid flu and toncolidece won’t stop me from getting sick and I still have my tonceces smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes party_popper yay beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes and I haven’t taken an flu vaccine since 2021 face_with_open_mouth I have a vary strong immune system party_popper
1,"Off topic, but I wonder how close extraterrestrial life is in the galaxy, from earth atleast..."

0,"well conventional vaccines, but this defective experimental crap has been a failure., sad to see you shilling it so hard. and thanks to the push on this experiment has done serious damage to trust in the medical system."
1,So what doesn't kills us makes us weaker. Time to dislike Kelly Clarkson's song.
1,What I find cool is that the monkey in the intro holds different things depending on the video's topic.
1,total bullshiit
1,If vaccines are so safe why are there so many people that make a big deal out of them? Usually where’s there smoke there’s fire. Is it because people fear what they don’t understand or are some vaccine manufacturers being slimy scum and not being totally honest with the public such as long term effects etc? I just don’t understand.

1,being a guinea pig leaves you weaker =)
1,"oh please don't use that annoying Wilhelm scream, it is so disruptive in an information piece."
1,"Nice. That being said: no mention (even an passant) of cardio and strength exercises, keeping a low amount of body fat, keeping Vitamin D levels above minimum, getting enough sleep and good portions of red protein. It's an 11 minute video. Surely you could spend 25 seconds to reinforce this."
1,"This is a great video-as someone who works in healthcare, you should make a broad one on autoimmune diseases."
1,"You probably should have used a better example for vaccines, like Influenza or Measles, given that the Coronavirus vaccines were notoriously untested, had incredibly sloppy data and studies to back them up, were corrected in their effectiveness SEVERAL times and overall had virtually no measurable effect."
1,DISGUSTING VACCINE PROPAGANDA… NOT TO MENTION HOW YOU ARE PREDISPOSING PEOPLE TO BE MORE ACCEPTING OF RANDOM AND UNEXPLAINED (UPCOMING AND MASSIVE) DEATH. ARE YOU STILL GETTING SPONSORSHIP FROM BILL GATES?
1,"Fun story: I attended Texas Christian University fron 2014 to 2018, & I showed 1 of my Sociology professors a Kurzgesagt video, then he started including links to them in his lectures."

2,"Always you guys give me a smile when a vídeo comes out.
I love It much heheh
A big hug from Brazil <3"
2,this channel is better than school
1,"Martie honestly looks pregnant. Pregnant people are immunocomprimised due to the parasite living in their belly (you know what i'm talking about!) fucking up the immune system so it isn't destroyed. So they need all the help they can get, because a pregnant woman is more likely to die from any disease. Except Jade, because late in her pregnancies, across multiple timelines, her immune system actually is _better_ than when she isn't pregnant. Odd. Maybe its because her godtiering turned her into a werewolf, and werewolves work differently from humans?"
2,This is good my dream is for kurzgesart to respond to one of my comments
1,"The video was ok until they started to mention vaccines a hundred times, it's like they were sponsored by big pharma.
What would have made it less sus, was if they mentioned vaccines are not always safe and can in rare cases cause something, like for example the pandemrix, which is the swine flu vaccine, caused narcolepsy in a lot of people, a friend of mine got narcolepsy after taking the swine flu vaccine, all he got was an apology.
I do think personally everyone should take a vaccine if they really need one, or we are fighting against the unknown, like when the corona pandemic started, we didn't know what we were fighting against back then and there were talks about long covid."
1,I wonder what if we use nuclear bombs to propel space ships?
1,"Yes, vaccines are great. However, we won't know for sure if the pharma corporations put in some other compounds inside the vaccine they are injecting in us.

Moreover, vaccines are usually required to be tested for over a year to be sure there are no unwanted side effects. The covid vaccine, however, are available to the public just under a month after they made."
1,As someone with MS? I am fairy sure I know how dangerous my Immune system can be.
1,"Came to the comments to laugh at the vaccine deniers. I was disappointed not to find any, but then happy to not find any."
1,"okay vaccines, but what about balanced diet, physical exercise, good night sleep.."
1,"If you're an atheist and need convincing that God exists, you only need to look inside a living cell."
1,This video is sponsored by. Pfizer
1,"You forget to mention that this video was sponsored by your globalist overlords ""The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"". When are you going to address the ""How Kurzgesagt Cooks Propaganda For Billionaires"" video by ""The Hated One""?"
1,"Me being sick right now: okay body, class time."
2,"cool animations bro
how do u do that"
1,Can tell which videos their benefactors write for them.
1,Watching this during class is doing me more good then actually paying attention.

1,"I feel like a video title that's about the dangers of your own immune system should've spoken about auto immunity a little bit more rather than just talk about vaccines again. I mean, it's great to spread awareness about vaccines, but this channel has done so many times before."
1,Early smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes!
1,Overpopulation is one side effect of the medical advancements.
2,pause at  and you'll thank me.
1,"This is going to look REALLY stupid/propaganda like when people get far enough forward that all of the executives for Pfizer saying they didn't even look at if the vaccine would prevent infection or spread is no longer taboo. All that shot did get tested for was that it lessened the effects. Still good, but that isn't a vaccine by any definition.

Do better at maintaining scientific fact in the future. REAL vaccines are a great and wonderful medical asset to have and we will lessen people's trust in science by pushing propaganda rather than truth.

Anyone who wants to respond about me being misinformed, I read the CDC documents on the Covid shot and from the beginning, it had a part stating that it would not stop spread or infection. Now it's ""common knowledge"" to anyone paying attention."
1, I can handle neutrophyls just fine but when the body gets attacked they are like chimps with machine guns
1,It's a good day when kurzgesagt uploads
1,"I love how vaccines were explained in this video. I know (sadly) of people who dont understand these simple facts and took part in riots here in Italy against the vaccines. They dont speak english, so i have no means of showing them this beautiful video."
1,"Hay Kurzgesagt, I have a question in your size video you talked about how thing that get bigger die brutally but you never said anything about how the tiny elephant die can you please do a video on this love you and your work. (P.S Take as long as you want)"
1,"mRNA technology isn't a vaccine. They mutated the definition of the word. It's still experimental. 

As for climate change, any scientist with his wits about him knows it's only a political strategy. None of their dire predicitons ever comes true and they had 3 decades to proove it. I stop listening to people who are wrong -- especially if their ideas is going to cause great human suffering in the 3rd world.

I'm an engineer. The numbers don't add up for climate change. Since they started silencing and defunding anyone who argues against it, it was no longer science anymore. It stopped being science the day it began.

It's just yet another back door to central planning utopianism. The idea responsible for more collective human suffering than any other manmade cause. It's a crime against humanity."
1,so this is why whenever i get sick i always get a fever. interesting
1,"yea umm but don't modern vaccines contain microchips?
i don't want to be hooked up to the 5G network
also birds aren't real and there is microplastic in my brain (thanks industrial revolution)"
1,crying_face
1,Natural immunity is better than the mrna therapy for covid.  This is medical misinformation.
1,"It is alarming to hear you tout the benefit of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 when it has harmed millions of people worldwide. I personally know five people who suffered lasting adverse events and one who died in his sleep the night following his second dose. 
After being a staunch supporter of this channel for years, I just lost a lot of respect for you."
1,Yes! Another immune system video
1,This channel used to list their sources for all of their info… I guess they didn’t find any articles they liked for this topic man_shrugging
1,Always a good idea to have something to prop the door open when it's hot. Especially in dojos
2,"wow, what a ridiculous video, and it's fun too, I'm learning that in my country :)"
1,"Your videos are awesome, as always. Thank you soo much for sharing these valuable lessons on Youtube !!"

2,this is a weird video to watch while i have a fever lmao

1,Vaccines are good but the covid Vaccines are not they where rushed out made in a couple og months it usually takes around 10 years to make a safe Vaccine so ask yourself is that really safe taking an experimental Vaccine that have not been tested !
2,Joker reference @ lol
1,As a smoker who will attempt a stop next month I would like to have kurzgesagt tell me how deficient it is making my body
1,"Bill Gates supports the channel... Of course it would be advocating for the m-rna vaccine. Don't be easily fooled by pretty visuals and a good story. Look at the data, more importantly look at the context of the data."
1,"It never gets addressed that V's aren't one size fits all, and we are resorted to secret language to even mention it because google erases comments. Why hide important information?"
1,"my response to ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"" was just ""so you're telling me that if you get mauled by a bear and lose your legs, but survive, you've been made stronger?"""
0,Me watching this while being sick: :p
1,Very nice and educative video im big brain noew
1,Brought to you by Pfizer!
1,"Excelent video, as always.

However, I cannot do anything but dislike this video because of the advertisement. Carbon footprint is coporate propaganda started by the oil companies to shift the blame from producers to consumers. They did the same thing with recycling in the 70s and 80s.

The average CO2 emissions of a person from North America or Europe is 16 tons/year, while the average CO2 emissions from a factory ranges from 100 to 800+ million metric tons/year. Taking the lowest possible value, of 100 MMT CO2/year, it would emit 273k tons/day, which is the equivalent of 17.000 people's yearly emissions every single day.

The emissions of most people are so insignificant compare to the emissions from factories, that it is laughably to even compare them. Tackling climate change start first and foremost by holding corporations accountable for their emissions, and only after that has been solved we can start talking about individual behaviours."
1,yo those immune things look kinda sus
1,Most astonishing mistake you make here is the claim that the natural immunity is weaker than the vaccine immunity. Let alone the latest product used for the purpose and failed completely. Your claim is obviously false also regarding the best ever existed vaccines in the history. Natural immunity is always waaaay stronger and efficient. Even only for the fact that every single real virus can be trapped by dozens of different antibodies.
2,Very cool
1,But what if vaccines give me the gay?
1,Sell the all doors and windows put on three masks one of the top of another and turn on the TV.
2,This is all from their book. I love it (:
1,"*People from 3rd world countries:* Look what, they need to mimic a fraction of our power!"
1,We expect better from your video as you just discussed only vaccine not lifestyle or food that we eat to boost our immune system.
1,Maybe tell us how to actually boost our immune system
1,"Lol it became obvious propaganda when you stated that healthy young Individuals were killed by Covid.

They weren’t."
1,waving_hand
1,reading your book: amazing!!!
1,"Autoimmune disorders are horrible, my wife has vasculitis and it’s terrible, it attacks her skin, joints, luckily it hasn’t attacked her organs yet"
1,It took me 3 seconds to realize 38s meant 38 SECONDS.
1,"this video was brought to you by bill gates, i kid you not, their sources quote Prof. Maristela Martins de Camargo of the University of São Paulo. This uni is a grant member of the gates foundation. If you want proof google the uni and bill gates yourself. in january 2020 they gave $345000 for research in pandemic preparedness, thats one heck of a foresight you have mr gates"
1,"this coming summer, us in autoparts will sell a lot of freon"
1,"Should have mentioned cardio and plant rich diet. Seriously, makes a big difference."
1,"Also, the permanent damage they've talked about in this video (let's say from a serious illness) isn't necessarily permanent because most of the body's organs and cells are eventually entirely replaced over several years. If you keep healthy and take care of yourself well enough, you could get a clean slate but with completely natural immunity. Obviously as we age these systems are more and more affected and you never fully recover but I felt that the content is biased without this particular piece of information. Natural immunity is good and vaccines are good, it's not clear which is better. Kurzgesagt's information and content is starting to have an air of political bias in my opinion. They're a good channel but I wish that they didn't let their political leanings govern their content (science doesn't care about politics)."
1,"""And now for the sponsor of this video, big pharma!"""
1,"I get cuts, burns, gouges, etc. daily in very dirty environments for decades (i'm 41).  never got any kind of serious infections (i do clean my wounds thoroughly and bandage, but often not for hours after the fact).  should I also mention that illness is an incredibly rare occurence for me.  I don't always eat healthy, I drink pretty heavily, I often sleep less than 6 hours a day, and work very hard 60 hours per week or more.  all that being said, I did get a very nasty 2 week bout of Omicron Covid, that made me feel as weak as a kitten, so I can see that immunity is never 100%"
2,Awesome! Thanks for the quality education!
1,"imagine a time before medicine, and a flu or very steep fever happen to you, no panadol or any kind of painkiller to take. That'd be hell to go through"
1, is it just me or has a monkey always been eating covid
1,"I’ll admit, I was kinda disappointed by this video. While it did say “immune responses are more taxing than you might expect (& here’s why)”, from the title, I thought it’d be about autoimmune disease or overreactive immune responses (which explains why sometimes a weak immune system can Save someone from a new illness). But in the end, it’s just “natural is not always the best, use vaccines!” which was already covered in the “Vaccine Side Effects” video. :/"
1,"In practice in life you get stronger but when you are actually in danger, I mean in real battle, you get weaker also in some other way. (emotional damage, body damage so on)"
1,Thank you so much for the amazing video!
1,"This the exact reason you see loads of complications after the covid mRNA vaccine! the S protein infects the good cells and the colateral damage si so high, the problem is that your body now has been ordered by the mRNA to produce this Spike Protin indefinitley! we will se how it goes in a few years! Honestly i m terrified, you should have put in the video that the mRNA vax is way different and experimental with no real trials and safety data!"
1,Damn. The Cytokines kinda thicc.
1,Just say no to mandated experimental medicine!
1,Why must we resort to military metaphors to explain the immune system? Using military metaphors reifies was as the solution for dealing with things that threaten us or might expose us to harmful microorganisms.
1,This is simply one of the most effective videos I have ever seen. It gives such detailed information in such a simple manner that one can't help but be in amazement! I never knew that about the immune response! Awesome OK_hand clapping_hands  Keep it up!! hundred_points
1,"covid vaccine does not work like a traditional vaccine. not all vaccines are the same, act wisely."
1,Damn... They're talking about vaccines. Now I'm going to get retaliation for sending this to certain members of society grinning_face_with_sweat
1,"As someone infected by diseases from small age 
I always wondered if my body was actually getting stronger by the antibodies or getting weaker. This video somewhat answers my question.

1,I miss when Kurzgesagt made cool videos about the incomprehensible nightmare void of space instead of propaganda
1,Keeping your backer Gates happy with content like this eh?
1,"That's why anti vaccine are dumb, the only debatable vaccine is the covid vaccine since they lied and it's way less effective than what they said and it's not really necessary"
1,"As much as I enjoyed it as every other video really... I was hoping it'll give me some sort of a life hack on busting immune system hah yes, that's vaccines, and obvious one, but I hoped for something like idk, eat more protein when you're sick or something"
1,Thanks for sponsorship bill gates
1,This video was sponsored by the deep state.
1,"I have a autoimmine disease called vasculitis so I know full well that my immime system can be a jerk. It attacks my blood vessels, it caused a vein rupture in my lung few years ago."
1,"Tangentially reminds me of another Kurzgesagt's video from 5 years ago - ""How Bacteria Rule Over Your Body – The Microbiome"".

Apparently there's a strong link between our gut health in and our immune system, and as much as I haven't really paid attention to those claims, I've experienced it first hand. I have changed my diet to one that - unbeknownst to me at the time - apparently improves gut health a great deal.

I've done it simply out of curiosity, and without any preconceptions as to what it'll do to me, but for the past year now, my body has basically sailed right over any sickness I've caught (flu, covid etc.) - any time I'm sick (which in itself happens *a lot* more scarcely than it used to), I'm no longer feeling bad like I used to; nowadays I'm just a bit less energetic, and my nose gets a tiny bit runny, but it haven't got any worse than that in any case so far.

Don't get me wrong - I'm absolutely not encouraing anyone to try and improve their immune systems with gut health *instead* of vaccines. I'm vaccinated for the common major diseases myself, but I do find the link between our microbiome and immune system to be damn interesting and worth paying attention to in our daily lives."
2,"The background music helped to keep my engagement  up, good move"
1,Vaccine didn’t out perform natural immunity lol
1,Why does your appetite drop when you're sick? Wouldn't it increase because of the increased demand for nutrients and energy to fight off the infection?
1,Thanks for the video; can we expect one on immunodeficiency disorders?
1,The most deadliest being on the planet is my most favorite one but I have a question? Why don’t all people just combined their normal cells just like them and mutate dumb to adapt and into a very deadly weapons and make them adapt very easily which would help peoples immune system they get very strongred_heartflexed_biceps_medium-light_skin_tone

2,I’m not allowed to have vaccines
1,"Your immune system works just better when you sleep well, eat good (avoid sugar and inflammatory foods), being active and satisfied with a purpose in life.
Following these improved my health significantly and reduced the number and severeness of regular infections. And I agree to the vaccinations.
Stay healthy."
1,"Great video. It’s a bit worrying it needed to be made though, since it was clearly made as a response to the antivaxxer turnips."
1,"Lol@pro pharma propaganda.
Talk about mRNA, lnp's, and gene therapy.
Also talk about efficacy and the scientific process and its corporate capture resulting in mass induced disease and death in medicine."
1,Video sponsored by Moderna and Pfizer
1,We can all agree that he never fails to entertain usheart_with_ribbon
1,"i agree about vaccines, but covid vacine is just poor performing and untested properly. normal ones take years to develop, this one was patched too fast, i had covid 2 times, and i was vaccined, after vaccine covid was just slightly easier to go trough, not worth of risking all those side effects pfizer vaccine has."
1,"So, if immune system uses nutrients from muscles for its working during a disease, does it mean that buff people have stronger immune system?"
1,"So if for example:

You are a young guy during covid, could you be sure that it won’t kill you if you already had it and your immunity to it was high?"
1,Omg I'm early
2,"Unlike Pfizer boosters, they just keep making you stronger and stronger!"
1,i never tire of watching this channel. good explainations in a concise manner and fairly good accuracy. also the animations and music are just phenominal and give me a good chuckle now and then. they've got me started reasearching other topics i normally wouldn't just because they had a video on said subject.
1,"This is the first Kurzgesagt video I have watched where I got the feeling there was opinion bordering on mild propaganda being proffered... High quality science education is so important so as a team please take care and keep the quality up and, most importantly stay impartial (regardless of who is funding your content...) I have nothing wrong with vaccinations in principle but covid was such a disaster / funnelling money from entire countries / the state to big pharma and their respective investors, partners and supporters. Just another pump and dump... so please, again, be careful with your messaging."
1,Did Bill Gates fund this video too?
1,"my body has this insane response when dealing with stress, it urges me to stab myself in the chest or jump from tall building. our immune response is crazy dangerous"

1,"""Imagine crazy aggressive chimps with machineguns""

1,"There's at least one mistake in your video: COVID-19 never mutated. There were new variants of it, but never any mutations. If it did mutate, everyone that caught COVID-19 prior would catch the newly mutated version again due to a lack of immunity from it. This means that variants are not the same as mutations. Variants are mild changes while a mutation practically means a new virus."
1,"Hi, the claim ""the immunity you get from a vaccine is often better than the natural resistance"" doesn't seem to be scientifically accepted and your sources do not back it up. It's a bold claim to make and I was expecting to find good evidence to back it up but I'm left wanting."
1,"I'm literally just sick right now and your posting this how do you know, do you have like a database where you see more people get sick this time of year, because this is an amazing coincidence."

I’ve actually went into a black hole before and that’s a nice experience.
2,Thank you for being amazing! :D
1,"We live in an environment that has co-evolved with us. We have an intricate ""waste removal and recycling"" system to help us cope with cellular degradation from all sources including senescence. Bacteria, mold, amoebae live on and in us and when we are healthy, happy and unassailed by toxins and deleterious environmental conditions, we thrive in their presence (some of which are even beneficial). When things get out of whack, this system kicks in (including autophagy to consume cellular detritus when we lack food intake) and corrects the situation during which its presence (symptoms) become evident. Good health does not rely on adding toxins to our system. Dying cells (for whatever reason) are broken down by our own enzymes and then consumed. Their presence can be confused with other entities but chains of RNA, DNA, lipids and proteins degrade rapidly and can be toxic. Unless ""viruses"" adhere to Koch's 4 postulates, they are neither a problem nor a presence as a separate entity. Logic and reasoning apply."

1,"While i have always being vaccinated since i was a kid, i have started questioning modern vaccines... especially after the news about the Phizer vaccine containing graphine oxide.

Vaccines are life-savers, no doubt, but that is true only if they're properly and safely made, something i'm not sure about lately. I'm very sceptical nowdays."
1,Can you do a video on what happens if you take medicine against fever. Does it actually slow down your imune system?
1,Finding this uploaded directly after scheduling an Influenza vaccine at the same time my friends got sick has got to be quite the coincidence. Also go Martie and the birds!

1,"Ever since i caught EB virus, likely from drink sharing since I had little other reason in that time. Mononucleosis for me was brutal. My throat was never the same, i lost vocal range, and had less energy/vitality forever since.

I was treated as if it was strep throat at first and it made it worse. Worst sickness ever, felt like death for 3 weeks.

Pisses me off i never heard of such a supposedly common virus. I was trying to overcome my ocd about drink sharing, due to the social pressures and shaming i got. It would be nice to know there was a serious virus behind that one could avoid, i always believed in avoiding germs over it, but never had a sound reason.

Just like dentists are lying asses for telling us sugar causes cavaties, and tooth decay, not the acid and bacteria - which is the real culprit. After learning that, i changed how I drank and mouth hygiene without issues for many years... 8 cavities and 3 root canals later..."
2,My favourite channel!!! Thank you!
1,"Seen a couple things going around of ""studies"" showing natural immunity was better against covid than a vaccine and I just can't begin to unpack how dumb that is. Great video as always!"
1,"What are you supposed to do when specific vaccines are tested, and don't provide good results, but are forced on people? 
What do you do when one of the several vaccines developed for the one disease shows good results, but is discontinued after being contaminated by one of those being forced on people, with bad results? 
How can people trust vaccines anymore?"
1,"This was by far the least informative video you guys have ever made. You left huge holes in your logic, and didn't even give further Info then get vaccinated. This is all just vaccine propaganda. You could convince me otherwise if you had so much as one way to boost your immune system other than vaccines. Even just talking about the benefits of vitamin C would have been enough to convince me this isn't biased. You guys are taking a dark turn, and I'm unsubscribed."
1,"I'd always had it in m head that natural immunity would be more effective because it was the real deal rather than a substitute, but I didn't think about how an artificial vaccine might be engineered to be more easily or efficiently processed by your body to develop better resistance. Huh."

2,"i literally had a fever like 3 days ago, its like a sign telling me to be more careful."
2,Lol provin that natural immunity to ANYTHING is way better
1,Would it be possible to promote the healing of scars to their original cells with some form of medical treatment?
1,"neutrophils… chimp with a machine gun.
Me, who read the Immune book: They said it! They said the thing!"
1,"Some false claims here... No, your body is much stronger in fighting future infection if it overcame it naturally vs vaccine route. Stating otherwise is false."
1,"hell yeah my immune system is dangerous. stupid immune system attacked my insulin producing cells. thanks type 1 diabetes! still wondering if there is a causal link to the oral steroids I was given a few months prior, that were later banned by the FDA for use in the United States LOL"

Plague Inc: Haha, FOOLS"
1,Don't vaccines remove natural selection for a good immune system? It seems like a reduction in suffering now for the price of weakness and reliance on technologically complex medicine for future generations.
1,Mhe. I've been told I was completely immune to COVID and AIDS
1,"2 questions here:
Why are there vaccines that you only need once in your life and some that you need many times like the covid vaccine which you ideally need to take every 6 months? 

Some vaccines elliminated diseases like smallpox. Why cant we do this to coronavirus?"
1,"
Graphs don't go backwards"
1,What about mRNA vaccines or was video like the Grammys and sponsored by phizer
1,What about eating boogers
1,Why do you guys keep changing the thumbnail every few days on these latest uploads? Its throwing me off.
2,"100% Safe and effective. 
Great joke."
1,so in short get vaccinated
1,Give me all the vaccines all the time. I want every single one.
1,The new Brazil president was (again) vaccinated by his vice today. The anti-vaccine genocidal isn't in power anymore and soon we'll be rejoining the top rankings in vaccine
1,"You are spreading vaccine misinformation, especially regarding the so-called covid-19 vaccines."
1,"Great, at the end of the video you are encouraging people to fight climate change by spending more money. This is wrong. The only way to “fight” it is by spending less."
1,But not the covid one
1,as a student this channel briefly makes me learn so much as still being in elementary school
0,This fraud should be behind bars!
1,"Can you do a video on autoimmunity as well? Don't forget to include the hygiene hypothesis, which kind of shows the other side of the coin if you don't have enough natural exposure to germs."
1,". . . Did you guys make this before, or after, it was just proven that natural COVID immunity is far stronger than the vaccine?"
1,"Lol you’re suggesting natural immunity from Covid is worse than the mRNA shot.

No thanks, won’t take the clot shot"
1,Ur body of strength gets lower so because if you have a fever your strength get smaller so it all begins to get small.grinning_face_with_sweat

1,"The thing with scars tho is that they fade over time, they're not a permanent debuff like the vid is tryna sell"
1,What's up dude! Your videos are usually awesome... usually.
1,"I would like to take a minute to compliment Kurzgesagt for informing good data and practices to all of us.

The better informed (the less confused, and wrong informed) people are, the happier and better lives we all get to live!

As a personal experience, i had some mildly bad parents, that really skipped my health when i was a child and teenager, that's when the little ones depend totally on people who should be informed and smart to know what's good for a kid (like going to check at the doctor multiple times a year, vaccines) and what isn't (like avoiding vaccines because of aliens or non-sense reasons) 

Which lead to me getting a really really rare disease, that i feel unlucky as it was like throwing 5 dice, and they all 5 landed on ""1""

This disease, left me hospitalized for some days, then at home, i recovered slowly and hardly from it, and i felt like a whole staircase long difference between how strong, smart, filled with energy i was, after fighting it.

I was like if i was half un-dead for the rest of my life, it took me ages to realize it was a permanent thing, that broke me physically and mentally, and along other life tough *** that i had to go thru alongside that, it was like living dragging a huge bag of depression and anxiety for not being as ""shiny"" and ""happy"" as i was before, it took years to let that sink in, and up to my now late 20's to make my peace with what one random day changed my life from an 8/10 to an almost permanent 1/10.

So enjoy what you have, be smart, curious, brave and think for yourself and inform yourself about what's good and what doesn't.

Because if you don't, then life's just gonna decide it for you, or others will.

Thanks again for all the amazing stuff you do @Kurzgesagt and people that do the same, you make the whole world a better place for the present and future, wish there was more people like minded, we would live in a different place, a better one, i can imagine it looking like a sci-fi movie for us right now, but i believe it is possible if we all work together into making the world a better place <3"

2,"The best way to train your immune system is to have regular contact with your environment so that your body has contact with all kinds of stuff. Go out side play in the dirt that kind of thing, nutrition helps as well"
1,"Hola, thanks for all you do! I thoroughly enjoy your videos and recognize, appreciate and enjoy the great work that goes into each one of them. Do you guys have a video/project request feature, where your viewers/subscribers/fans like me could tell you breakdown videos like this we would like to see you make, even if only just for you to get more ideas for what to make next? Personally right now I'd like to see a video on ""What happens (to the body, brain, mind) when you have sex/ejaculate/release testosterone"".

Again, cheers for the awesome work you do. party_popper"
1,Wait!!!!could scar tissue be healed???
1,"Start of this video disappoints me, there is an age old comeback ""What doesn't kill you, just makes you stronger. Or it's just killing you slowly."""

Kurzgesagt: ""Imagine crazy aggressive chimps with machine guns.""
Me: ""Got it."""
1,All for planting new trees and protecting the rainforest. However to say off out your carbon footprint as if we are the big problem and not address the fact that the people in front of the charge of climate charge have the highest carbon out put of anyone on earth. Address the real problem.
1,"pleae let covid out this, that wasn't a vaccine , i mean seriously"
1,"This channel is amazing; was watching since i was 7! Made me passionate about bio abd climate change, keep up the good work!"
1,I just finished Philipp Dettmer’s ‘Immune’ but obviously still watching :)
1,I survived against Ebola when i was a baby.
1,the late 2022 I got COVID it was a really bad fever and I vomited a lot and I felt real nauseous too and the vaccine probably saved my life
1,"This just goes to show that the human body still has a long ways to go before being perfected down to a science. I’m hearing all sorts of horror stories about people who had one simple illness as a child and their whole life is ruined because of it. There is a lot of studying to go before we truly know how the human body works and responds to diseases, but we are far better than what we were even just a century or few decades ago."
1,Mine is a super jerk.  2 auto immune diseases and anaphylaxis. woozy_face. But I love learning about the immune system!
1,For some reason after seeing the heart damage I knew this was gonne go the vaxx direction.
1,"@Kurzgesagt  I see what you did there , that's the outline of Ukraine, I could tell because of the rivers shown (Dnieper to the top left and Dnister and Prut to the bottom) you tought you were being sneaky huh? Hehe face_with_tears_of_joy I like finding all those little easter eggs in your videos."
1,You were doing so well until you got to the vaccines. You should dig deeper into the history of vaccines.
0,"What Actually Happens When You Are Sick?

you get sick. then boom your neither ok or dead"
1,But the biggest question and the biggest philosophical question that scientists can't answer is how does the immune system know this ? It's like our immune system moves with a conscience but it doesn't have a conscience. there are theories but no one knows for sure. I like the God Theory
1,Why do I wanna play the kurgzguesagt video game?
0,Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
1,"That's a very sad message to spread to millions. Instead of eating healthy, not being obese, not drinking, not smoking, running and doing resistance training - just get the vaccine, it's the best solution..."
2,That was very informative. Keep up the great work! slightly_smiling_face

1,"All true, but also worth looking into the specific mechanism a vaccine uses for making its ""paper dojo"".

The mRNA coronavirus vaccines have been specifically designed in a way that your cells  are not just collateral damage of the immune response.

Causing your own cells to transcribe the coronavirus spike protein will induce a cell's cytokine response, mark the cell for death and trigger auto destruct since this process looks like being attacked by a real virus.

This causes a very ""real dojo"" experiance for many people (permenant accumulated tissue  damage, like from a real i fection). Other people get the intended ""fake dojo"" experiance."
1,Uh hi can someone answer my q? By a chance? When im sick my sleepiness is the exact opposites when im almost asleep like yeah i only got somewhat 1minute of sleep? Is that weird?

1,You know its a good day when kurzgesagt uploads
1,"It's dissappointing that you got into advertising the highly dodgy carbon offset market. There is basically no regulation enforced on these companies in terms of permanency of carbon storage / emission avoidance. Concerning carbon storage such as tree planting, reliably and precisely quantifying the carbon is also extremely difficult, if not impossible. Which unfortunately results in the whole industry being a lot of greenwashing, with any corporation seeking to appear more ""Eco"" happily jumping on the bandwagon."

Im asking Bill Gates and Co. They could give back to society by providing them.
They live like Kings...because of us. So i want to see them give back big time."
1,"Disease and climate change are a mild cold compared to stupidity. Our spices worst enemy. Stupidity regarding vaccines, global warming, war and violence.

1,"*takes Phitzer vaccine, unalived from blood clots!*"
1,Thanks Fizzer.   I guess I should inject your products daily instead.
1,"I want to ask, does covid 19 cause any permanent damage to the human body, since I've had it 3 times and I have noticed a little weaker lung capacity."
1,"I think you can keep your immune system strong by just making sure you take a good multivitamin/mineral tablet daily plus some extra vitamins C and E.  Definitely stay away from using tobacco, pot, coffee, fried foods, and anything else that dumps one load of free radicals into your body after another.  But, even with all that, a bug may come along that will overwhelm your immune system and that's when it's good to have antibiotics as a back up."
1,make a set of a 100 mini videos on immunology.

1,Meat is carcinogenic and inflammatory.... stop eating it.
2,Antivaxxers be seething here lol
1,"Immunity starts at the barrier of defence. A respiratory pathogen can't be vaccinated against with an intramuscular injection. You will bypass important immunological cascades if you send in troops ""beyond enemy lines'. A successful lasting vaccine for a respiratory pathogen should start at the epithelium in the respiratory tract. 
Anything else, wherever injected, isn't triggering a full immune response. This is why a single successful immunisation against a respiratory pathogen doesn't exist."
1,Vaccines AND climate change in one video?  I can hear the incessant screeching from tinfoil wrapped morons already.
1,hmmm thinking_face Bill Gates approves this video.nerd_face

MRNA technology is still in development and we don't have enough longitudinal studies to verify safety concerns.   This topic, competent understanding of which can literally mean life or death for your viewers who you have a responsibility to, deserves a far more nuanced discussion and education than what you have provided here.   I wonder how deeply you consider these ethical concerns.  As more information comes out about covid vaccines and their efficacy (lack thereof) and risks (the lethality we are only beginning to realize) you make videos telling people how stupid they are for not completely trusting pseudo-science that was shoved through safety barriers to line the pockets of Pfizer, among others.  Shame on you for pandering to the woke mob.  Even more shame if as a self-identified scientific organization you turn a blind eye to the truth for political and social reasons at the cost of the lives of your customers."
1,The vaccine type mentioned in the video is NOT the new (experimental) mRNA vaccines.
2,I hope you will never have problem with your immune system. It can be devastating.

Thanks for that bit! Love your vids and I hope you keep making them! I love how you use ducks alot to. Anamation is right down your ally!"
1,PSA: The Covid Vaccine was proven to be a scam and worse for the human body.
1,You still talking about carbon footprint bs?
1,I feel like a lot of this wasn’t in the book

1,I dont understad why i used to be healty all the time. I felt like i am super immune. But then i stared to work as a teacher and covid happened since then i got 7 time sick this winter. Is it beacuse covid or beacse i work with kids?! What have happned to me?
1,"Well, Kurzgesagt finally jumped that shark out loud by telling people to get vaccinated. I wonder why......hmmmmm.

FYI, it's been known for decades that natural immunity is way better than any vaccine. Unbelievable you're blatantly lying to your audience about natural immunity. Once gain.....I wonder why."
0,No way a fever is killing my gains
1,"Why is it that we must artificially boost our immune system with so this so called science.  
Our immune systems where doing a great job until we all started poisoning ourselves and each other.  Evolution has been honing your body and its immunity to natures nastys . Seriously your ability to defend yourself from these infections and so on is in perfect balance with nature.  
And shouldn't ever be though of as something that our cleverness could possibly boost with a quick idea... 
I trust 200 000 odd years of evolution over big pharma$ money hungry scheems. 
So much so.  Even antivaxers still exist.  Soooo nature and evolution = human survival and immune system.  
And big pharma = money hungry = profit from fear = poison experimental experimental jab = heart attacks in athletes  and middle age people.  
Wake up.  
Remember the the toad and the cane beetle story.  
This mrna vaccine stuff is brought to us via the different but same fkn insane kinda short term logic its the same kinda geniuses that blame global warming on the people but keep flights going so loggers can reach their work site in the Amazon rainforest... ect"

1,Who else is waiting for the Kurzgesagt video game?
1,"i consider myself having a stronger immune system, when i get sick it's usually for 1-2 days then goes away, 
i had a stomach bug a few weeks back had a massive headache, nausea, and the other symptoms of a stomach bug, i couldnt keep food down for 12 hours and my symptoms alleviated the next day. my brother contracted the same thing but his symptoms lasted 3 days longer than mine did
i'll usually get more severe symptoms but total time i'm sick usually is extremely short"
1,"It's too bad to see you guys still shilling for vaccines as if everything is fine, even after the debacle with mRNA technology the last couple years. Will you ever address that reality? It's in such poor taste to still be cranking out ""vaccines are liquid gold"" propaganda as if it's all the same, which it's clearly not."

1,"While I really love your videos on Physics and Astronomy, these videos on diseases right after the pandemic are very cool. It shows how, even more important to y'all than explaining cool concepts is your mission to educate the public on things that are important to our daily lives and may have lots of misinformation. Also, your drive to scientifically research topics thoroughly and without bias makes me want to do the same in my career. Thank you Kurgzgesagt!"
1,Stop fake hyping the immune system. Can't even get rid of chlamydia on it's own a bacteria not even a virus.
1,"My immune system decided that it needed to create a mutiny against my right eye and presenting its malfunction via arthritis. 

In my eye. 

Why."
1,I dont see the link to any Bill Gates website this time. Weird how he stopped funding this channel after selling his pfizer stock.
1,Buy their book it is all about the immune system and is interesting
1,"i haven""t had a vaccine but im ok"
0,Damn a war inside my body? So who got rejected and started the war this time?
1,Great video as always but the background music is a bit destructing...
1,This makes anti-vaxers' idea of strength by experience of sickness even worse. Hopefully the spread of think kind of knowledge will lead less of an intellectually and physically weak populace.
1,I like how the nucleus of the cells are like one big eye for them in these animations
1,I can't remember when l watched advertising with interest
1,Or the company that made the vaccine lied about.
1,"Kurzgesagt has actually done many immune system videos in the past, but it is so committed to make them even better each time. Still, I do kinda miss the old artstyle and colored circles though."

1,"How to cancel wren subscription
Please some one tell me"
1,"Well, I usually love this channel but this video was biased like never saw before. That's the first time I see this here. So......You just showed a mass effect of the vaccine versus nature and said it is better like that, so you are not talking about the individual you just said each person is different than you say it's better to vaccinate. But you have no idea if You are good against COVID or not, and no idea if you are going be that small chance to get real bad health from that said vaccine. Also You don't go in details of why they cause what they do. You are afraid of retaliation. You are not being scientifical here. I want to know why some of those COVID vaccines have cause some hear and blood circulation problems. What they have in their compositions and their differences, by each manufacturer. People can choose and You did not helped, it's like saying to a meat eater to eat vegetables."
1,Basically you're body goes into American ww2 industrial overdrive to protect youre body
1,It's not a vaccine if it does not protect against anything.
1,this video was sponsored by the pharma industry
1," even your sources prove this claim false! We haven’t yet made a vaccine that provides more protection than infection. We’ve gotten close, but never done better. Why would you include this debunked claim in this video?"
1, normal day in interwar Poland
2,"Great as always, thanks:)"
1,"So I guess healthy food, sports, good sleep, avoiding stress, being in nature and fulfilled is not on the list, just getting more vaccines, like the lady who is still working on her house. And then you can subscribe to that advertised platform to blame your self from climate change and not setting on fire huge polluting corporations."
1,"Just scolded my mom for trying to avoid vaccines thanks to this video. Maybe the scar tissue warning will get her to change her mind. She gets very sore and tired from vaccines and her last covid booster made her intestines upset. She has to get colonoscopies regularly to check for cancer, they make her very uncomfortable, as she has PTSD from childhood sexual abuse. But she got her therapist to help her adapt. So I asked her why she can't, or won't, do the same for the COVID vaccine. I don't like getting my teeth drilled, but I still do it because I like being able to chew without pain. Sometimes I feel like she won't listen because I'm her daughter, while her anti vaxxer sister is older. I still sit there stonily while she goes on about the evils of big pharma, that 'vaccines have changed since I was a kid they're more toxic now!' and stuff like that, with my face twitching thinking... ""I swear to god Auntie Tam if you put any of this in her head of blindly confirmed her biases..."""
1,"The Immune book was the most interesting book about biology I've ever read. The perfect combination between facts and entertaining metaphors made it so fun to read. And I actually learned a lot too. I wish more books were written in a fun way like that! Great job to y'all who have been working on these videos and the book, I was a little curious about microbiology to begin with, but now I'm totally fascinated by it, thanks to the book especially :)"
0,Who is watching this while sick?
1,"i love that chart in , man you did post one of my most favourite video about false vacuum and you can still post such a... thing"
1,"The real problem with vaccines is not how (or if ) vaccines will work in your unique immune system, but the fact that the vaccine is created by humans who are chasing specific goals that are impossible to guess. Yeah, the problem of trust."
1,i usually like your videos very very much but thid one seems like a mix of already uploaded Videos of yours. a bit disappointing because i always thought of you as a very creative channel with new things but this is really just a patchwork of already told topics
2,why are the viruses cute? WHY?
0,"
In his book he said chimps on crack(the other word) with a bad temper and a machine gun"
1," that is according to medical doctors not the case. Yes vaccines are good, but the real deal is still better. Your immune system is literally the result of evolution of millions of years. The point of paper vs nature dojo of course stands."
1,"Hey, have you ever thought that Kurzgesagt should totally make a sweet animated series about LitRPGs? I mean, come on! We need more pixelated avatars battling in virtual worlds on our screens! It's like watching your favorite video game, but without the hassle of actually playing it. Plus, it's the perfect excuse to eat junk food and not feel guilty about it."
1,So an immune response is an infection erection.
1,"think its a good idea to promote healthy diet and exercise also? getting plenty of sunlight, vitamins and rest. vax for sure helps but a person should be giving them a healthy body to perform at their highest level. would hate to see this channel go towards some big pharma propaganda machine like so many of the others. good work guys"
1,"You should've named this video - ""your immune system is a jerk"" face_with_tears_of_joy Then it would've gotten more views grinning_face_with_sweat jk"
1,thank you for keeping science at the forefront in the face of misinformation and deliberate ignorance! I'm always happy to see a new Kurzgesagt video has come out
1,love to see all the awareness about climate change that this channel brings
1,"Your Immune book seriously helped me pass Microbiology and Pathology/Pharmacology in nursing school. The Immune system is seriously a complex system, and you made it easier to understand."
1,"I bloody knew it !
7 minutes just to arrive at yet another ""get your jab kids !"" message.
I was expecting perhaps something about the numerous vitamin or mineral deficiencies that impact so many people's immune system, or something about the ravages that excess sugar and carbs cause for so many people in developped countries.

I'm not antivax by the way, I'm just sick of seeing that all the advice people get is usually about taking more man-made drugs to fix health problems when we now know that a huge part of these problems could be avoided or fixer by teaching people how to properly eat."

1,Depends on the vax. Personally the ones for school are great.  But I'm gonna need at least 20+ years of data to trust one.
1,"Another good ""hack"" is to maintain a strong ""war chest"" for when you get sick (and try to maintain it when you are sick if you are able to). 

Eat healthy foods so you have a stockpile nutrients at the ready so that your body can build an ample supply of immunological weaponry as quickly as possible.  Also, maintain some fat reserves.  Not so much that it impairs bodily functions but enough that you can go a few weeks without food if needed, your fat reserves can store stockpiles of certain nutrients that other parts of your body just can't (your liver can do this too but it has like 400 other jobs to do and will be working very hard when you are sick) and fat acts as insulation, allowing your body to maintain a temperature while using fewer calories, calories that can then be spent other things. If you have an ample supply of energy reserves (fats) and building materials (nutrients) your body will also do a much better job of repairing any damage (more new cells and less scar tissue)."

1,"VIEWER DISCLAIMER FOR BIASED CONTENT: the video presented a great beginning explaining what happens when we get sick, the problem is when it starts selling you the vaccine agenda, again the magic bullet against any disease narrative. Remember that Kurzgesagt receives donations from none other than the Bill Gates foundation, and if you follow their money you will see that Gates owns or holds shares of lots of vaccine manufacturers (which our governments blindly spend our tax dollas and GRANT LEGAL IMMUNITY TO). Never believe 100% in a video because it may be biased or hiding intent, always remember to search and follow the money. Kurzgesagt videos are good and well made but is clear the bias towards Agenda 2030. Stay safe."
1,"In discussing ways that disease can make you weaker, you left one thing out. Some diseases, such as measles can somehow delete or deactivate the B lymphocytes that store information about how you fought other diseases.

1,"It's interesting how the entire video starts, right away, with the germ theory, which is to create a context of antagonism between you and the external world. This is not entirely false, as we are constantly fighting external threats (just not always a sentient treat, it can be the cold or pollution), but it's also very limiting.

Also, the video goes down at , when it starts talking about vaccines (we see it coming). They had the nerve to claim that ""vaccines often provide better immunity than natural immunity"". What a load of crap. Vaccines short-circuit the normal immune response, and introduce toxins directly into the bloodstream. Not a very good strategy. They also had the nerve to show the stupid graph of measles going down in cases (not deaths) over time, and falsely attributing the outcome to vaccines.

Instead, one would have expected to see things like, have better sleep, less excessive stress, avoid free radicals, drugs and sugar. Nope, they went straight to vaccines, one of the most controversial and suspicious treatment method of all time."

1,"Another banger vid! 
Congratulations on 20M!"
1,Do your research on vaccines guys. For the most part they are safe but COVID vaccines have been experimental and are shotty at best. Lots of new information coming out on the negative effects of those vaccines specifically so just make sure you guys are doing research
1,"Having a hyper-responsive immune system is part of the core of auto-immune diseases -- it's also often a bad thing. (Speaking as a person with Behcet's vasculitis and diabetes)

If your immune system is compromised, a vaccine won't work as well as in a healthy person.  Some estimates say that we only get 60% of the effectiveness that is 95% or so in a healthy individual.

One of the best defenses for our immune system?  The barrier method.  I wear a mask all the time when I go out, and I used to wear some very stylish N95 masks before the pandemic to avoid flus, since I have a tendency to pneumonia.

Every time I see people who are wearing masks still, inside, I bless them.  They are saving the lives of people like me."

It happened twice, scaring me like never before. Went to the hospital the first time, was told my blood pressure was so high and all they did was give me an injection to lower it. Days pass, I visit the hospital again, a completely different doctor sees me and claims I have anxiety, told me to get a shot of diazepam. 
Weeks pass and the burning feeling returns, seemingly moving from the right side above my ear to my neck, to the point where my skin/scalp feels numb. And now, a sore throat combined with a headache is all I feel. 
What could I even have? I'm waiting for a neurologist to see me but that can take so long. My life's halted ever since this begun, and I was about to finish driving school."

2,"NOOOO , Getting sick kills your gains everybody. Wash your hands please for the gains"
1,"I got to experience a virus that made me weaker when I was 20. This is a long story that took/takes place over 6 years so far.

          I got sick while on vacation in Florida and I did something you should never do. I took medicine while drinking some beers(also yes it was underage drinking I know). Sickness seams to go away mostly but then on the drive back home I was getting really dizzy in the car but that got better. Then when I went back to work I was having trouble standing for more than 5 min before getting dizzy. I went to the doctor the next day because it had then been 3 days of dizziness they did the normal thing and weighed me and all that. I weighed in at 149 lbs which was low from my normal, but still low for a 5'11"" guy, 160 at the time. They gave me a shot, told me to go to the ER if it got worse, and sent me on my way.

          3 days later I got a friend to bring me to the ER because I was getting really dizzy even when sitting down and laying down made it worse, I got the first of many migraines, and my hands had started to shake a little bit. Got there and they weighed me in at 141 lbs. Which I didn't believe and I showed them the paper work from the doctor of the tests they did that I brought along just in case it would help. That plus the dizziness got me scheduled for a CT scan. Now the radiologist aren't supposed to tell you anything really and she didn't but the look on her face when she saw the scan and how she just left the room was quite worrying. I get put into a room so I can get an MRI in the morning after a second CT scan. All the doctor says and shows me is that there is a weird spot in my brain around the base of the skull about the size of a thumb. That night I get weighed again and weigh in at 138 lbs. That made the nurse rush out and get the doctor to show him. They then told me they were going to weigh me a couple more times throughout the next day.

          Got weighed first thing in the morning and weighed in at 131 lbs. Got an MRI and got brought back to my room. Learned I couldn't walk without holding onto something anymore and my hands shook enough that I couldn't hold the fork for lunch. The migraines blurred my vision more than it already is(I wear glasses). They felt like someone was running knives over my head branching from the back of my head forward. Doctor came in and weighed me again after a second MRI. I was down to 128 lbs. They also got a neurologist to come in he then took all the data to a team 3 neurologists(that turned to 9 later). He told me not to worry because from what he could see it was just some minor inflammation with no signs of getting worse over the couple of scans they did. Blood work was done as well and that showed that there was no virus present anymore so we never found out what I got exactly. 

          The next day I get weighed in the morning again and weighed in at 124 lbs. Did another MRI and then the neurologist came in with what was basically a drawn and printed out powerpoint presentation and he got one of the other neurologists on a video call. He went through explaining a lot of what they found and how the only case they found similar to mine was some lady in 1993. He told me what happened to me was about a 1 in 300million chance and in part I was lucky because it could've been much worse. The virus had gotten past the blood brain barrier which was probably weakened by the alcohol and medicine combo. That caused a slight over reaction in my immune system which led it to keep fighting even after the virus was gone. He told be the inflammation would go down in a couple of weeks or months but the nerves where permanently damaged. Good thing was that I was young so my brain would eventually learn to use other pathways to do the same jobs. I asked him how long he thought that would take and he told me that if I agreed to do some physical therapy then it would probably take about 8 years to ""heal"". If I was younger the damage done probably wouldn't have affected me for that long but because my brain was almost done developing it needed more time. If I was older there would have probably been no hope for going back to normal. When I got weighed in the afternoon I was still 124 lbs. I had lost basically all my fat and about 40% of my muscle mass. The doctor then told me that if I had lost even 1 more pound he was going to put me in the ICU but then he gave me the option to go home as long as I would come back if I felt anything getting worse. I also had to come in for tests and MRIs the next week and every 2 weeks after that for a couple of months. They gave me a couple of medications and even wrote on a note attached to the prescriptions that i should use protein powder to help gain my weight back. I then started 6 months of physical therapy. 

           The dizziness became persistent while I was in the hospital and got worse over time. The physical therapy made it better but for about a year straight I was always dizzy. Couldn't even watch TV without feeling like I needed to puke. Looking over at something to quickly made it feel like I did a flip. I couldn't write easily but I kept practicing and part of that was the muscles in my hands being so weak that holding things became painful after a little while. After a year I was doing a lot better. The migraines became very rare and I could walk around for a couple of hours before feeling to light headed. Now 6.5 years later I'm basically back to normal. Sometimes my sense of balance just ""turns off"" so I can't feel if I'm standing upright or not. It is usually followed by a sense of falling when it comes back. My hand shaking and all that was getting rarer but recently came back for another extended round of annoyance. So every once in while I drop things and typing this out I would hit the same letter like 3 extra times (good thing for auto-correct). At the rate it's going idk if I will ever get back to normal but it is a lot better than what it was. Though I don't have that weight problem anymore as I am now around 200 lbs and am physically stronger than I've ever been but even with that sometimes I walk like a drunk man and can't do any kind of task requiring fine motor control efficiently."

1,"There's so much propaganda around vaccines, and it's not always ""good vs evil"". I'm vaccinated, and I still get demonized.

I was personally wary of the early mRNA vaccines. I waited for the Janssen vaccine for my first jab, which was available just as soon as I became eligible in my state for a first jab anyway. This made zero difference to my treatment. Once I saw more mRNA data in the wild, I got an mRNA booster. Does this make me ""anti-vax""?

Some vaccine advocates will physically recoil when I say I got the Janssen shot, as though I'm a defective and evil person. I didn't get the ""right"" shot, so I'm one of ""them"". This is absolutely awful and dehumanizing. And I'm fully vaccinated!

My experience being demonized for getting the ""wrong"" vaccine gives me empathy for a lot of ""anti-vax"" people. Many of whom aren't anti-vax at all.

I know someone who got a vaccine and then immediately got Covid. They were fully entrenched in media at the time which told them the vaccine prevented Covid. Stephen Colbert was on TV telling them Covid was over and everyone would be back to work soon and masks were ending. This person felt so betrayed, they swore off the Covid vaccine, but still stay up to date on their flu shot. Is this ""anti-vax""?

I knew an immune compromised elderly couple who had a large gathering during the height of Covid, believing the same rhetoric about how Covid was over if you got vaccinated. Are they ""pro-vaccine""?

Real life isn't binary. Just believing a certain set of rhetoric doesn't necessarily make you better or even correct. We all have to act on the best data we have at the time. And we all need to be supportive and help people make better choices."

1,"using the country comparison, a vaccine is like an emergency drill. A weaker version of the attack that can't really hurt as much but it can teach you how to fight an actual war. Sure, it's not the real thing, but you can still learn a little about how to deal with these situations better. Would you want to train by going to fight immediately (like developing an immunity by getting the real disease)? you might get more resistant, but you can also lose lots of resources."
1,Amazing how informative the video is until it gets to the very biased part.
1,Starting to believe the conspiracy theories abt this channel ngl
1,"""this is why seemingly very healthy young people died from Covid, while for some elderly people it was more like a mild flu."" 

what?! this is completely not true at all. Like i have gotten this info from science educators here on youtube, and my sister who is a doctor, it is the complete opposite, older people were less immune and gotten a lot sicker then younger people because of the healthy immune system younger people had. Is you guys source maybe from the W.H.O. by any chance?

because so you guys know and keep the right info in your videos, they have a lot of graphs and statistic terribly wrong and doctored to make it look like something horrible is going on because of they're ideologies. This has been proven now several times with things like the influenza pandemic death rate and that they tried to shrug off the fact that the CEO of the company they hired to produce the covid 19 vaccine (Pfizer) had a felony for misbranding anti-inflammatory drug Bextra with the intent to defraud or mislead. Pfizer pulled the drug from the market in 2005."
1,"Used to really like this channel until that video came out and exposed kurzgesagt for lying a lot about being veiwer funded, they use 1 source for most info, and are biased. Turns out billionairs fund the channel and they lie to you about pretty much everything they stand for. Also the “scientists” who verify this are also biasly paid"
1,This was surprisingly uninformative compared to the usual from K ... Lacked in nuance/insights and pushed a fundamentally reductionist argument.

- Sometimes what doesn't kill you makes you weaker. Your immune system is as dangerous to you as it is to enemies. Your body is literally consuming itself to keep the defense going. If your whole system is strained when you get sick, just keeping your immune responses going can overwhelm your capacities.

I study demographics at university, and the current collapsing birthrate seems like an enormous issue, as dangerous as climate change to our prosperous lives. We make less kids, and this means in the next few decades, less jobs, less food, and so on. With my years at college I also learned that the population boom during 60s and 70s is directly linked to our skyrocketing economy in the 2000s."

Also fun to know why I lose my appetite while sick -- on that note I have a question on that... when I was young I learned quickly whatever I ate while very sick would be nearly ruined for me (if I ate a type of food I liked, I'd be repulsed by it for months / sometimes years afterwards) UNLESS it was plain carbs. So like plain bread, pasta with nothing on it, cream of wheat, those I can do and not only can stomach a little while sick but I still like said carbs afterwards, why is it that plain foods are acceptable if your digestion is on a break?

Would you drive a car when the manufacturer had no liability if it failed and harmed you and the government would pay out IF you won in a special court set up to pay from taxpayer funds?

Also be sure to know the difference between vaccines and the mRNA technology used in the Covid shot. They are very different technologies."

1,"Immune system is so ridiculous and advanced, you really should do a whole movie feature covering it someday. Even with hours it would be hard to explain it all."
1,"Oh great, let's make people even more scared and distrustful of their own bodies' capacity to heal from disease and distress, and thereby become even more addicted and dependent on external elements (doctors, procedures, pharmaceuticals...) to maintain functionality.

Your body is intelligent. It's been primed by millions of years of natural selection, developing incredible resilience and flexibility just to keep you alive. Give it what it needs (healthy food, water, frequent movement, sleep, sunshine...), and then let it do its job. Am I crazy to think this way?"

1,I'm resistant to COVID but I have gotten the flu many times
1,"Vaccines should also work with parasites and fungi as well,
In fact some viruses(mainly bacteriophages) can make infected cells behave like a vaccine,
In theory, as bacteria get infected by bacteriophages,usually becomes sluggish and reacts slowly,
making infected bacteria prone to being eaten by our own immune system, intern the bacteriophage helps white blood cells fight bacteria infection’s better,
The down side for the bacteriophages is;
If an infected bacterium gets eaten by a white blood cell(or other traditional bacteria eaters) the phages themselves will get digested,
and the phages won’t be able to infect farther cells.
And other similar parasite fighting viruses can also treat terrible diseases(including malaria)as vaccines,
since viruses reproduce after and while they the infect a cell,
This is helpful,since most medicines can only kill a certain number of organisms before it runs out,
A viruses hijacking ability to reproduce,fixes that issue,
and they can also kill off parasites much faster than some other medicines.
And that’s a useful side of viruses that can help prevent human diseases!"
1,One of the firsts!
1,"This is a video worth sharing to anyone you know with vaccine hesitancy who thinks they can rely solely on natural immunity. Well played, Kurzgesagt."

1,"And yet we have those ""Anti Vaxers"" Karen morons, who believes government has tracking in the vaccines or some other bs. Worst part is that some people can't get certain vaccines for medical reasons, so they have to rely on others to get them, so the illness never gets to the exposed person who couldn't get the vaccine. So not only are they harming their own children, but also others face_with_rolling_eyes this generation is beyond stupid face_with_rolling_eyes"

Thankfully, it's under remission through infusion treatments, but a simple cold passed on by, say, an EMT transporting me from one hospital to another (this was when I was hospitalized for pulmonary embolism) can, will, and has knocked me off my feet for about 10 days.

One day I was perfect healthy and then next thing I knew I couldn’t shoot basketball anymore (like I couldn’t get the ball up to the hoop) and then 2 weeks later I was barely able to climb up the steps, and I couldn’t open my water bottles or cut my nails.

Why have you chosen Covid as a disease and the C-vaccination as example? There would have been far better ones!

 ""This is why seemingly healthy young people..."" Yes, according to the data there had been some seemingly young and healthy people who succumbed to C. However this was pretty rare!
 Vaccine-Dojo vs. Nature-Dojo.... good example! But again... why have you used C as an example when there are other diseases like measles or poliomyelitis where the positive effect of  vaccination is clear.... and for C it is very doubtful! thinking_face"

1,"Getting vaccinated against serious illnesses make perfect sense.  Measles, mumps, rubella, etc are all likely to be fatal or severely debilitating if you don't get vaccinated.  Minor inconveniences are poor choices for vaccination, as you're likely to get just as sick with the vaccine as with the real disease, so why bother?  As I watched this video, I was just waiting for them to mention CoViD... when they did, I groaned.  For anyone curious, I've never had a flu vaccine, never had the flu.  Never got the CoViD vaccine, do not wear masks ever.  2.5 years after CoViD came to the US, I finally contracted it... I was feeling off for about 12-18 hours, and then back to normal.  Most people who got the vaccine reported sickness/illness for 3-5 days, so I think I won that deal."
1,I don't know if it's me alone when I get sick I get more hungry rather then more sleepy like for real.
1,"This video hits home for me. 2 years ago my Mom passed due to COVID. It caught us all by surprise. She was the one who rarely ever got sick. She would be the one who took care of my siblings and I (especially me) whenever we were sick. Sadly, her immune system was weak against covid. She went to the hospital a day before she was scheduled to get her vaccine. Fuck covid"
1,I guess I'll take the plunge. . . . Why did they make the girl look like she's smuggling something? Is that suppose to be fat?
1,"If the immune response decreases digestion, then you can eat more food and/or more caloric food when you're sick. That's a nice bonus I guess."

1,"Vaccines aren't special. Your immune system is your immune system and responds the same way no matter how you're infected. Damage will occur either way because your immune system doesn't deal in bokken. It's showing up with the AK47 every time.

Seriously, do you think vaccines utilize HIV or steroids or some other immune suppressor? Because that's the only way you're going to tone down your immune response to ""play fight"" level.

Also, the best vaccines are ~80% effective. Less over a lifetime in many cases."

1,"Mass non-differential vaccination against COVID not only failed as a solution but was mistake. At the end everyone got infected and gained natural immunity. The vaccine was effective exclusively for the elderly and the co-morbid. 

Your inability to take a stance epsilon more nuanced than most vanilla, especially in the context of the absolutly catastrophic damage to the environment e.g. mask waste and alcogel bottle waste, is disappointing at the least and suspicious at the worst."

1,This video would have been relevant 2 years ago.
0,These videos are starting to feel more and more like propaganda lately. What a shame.
1,A black eye or a bruise...or irreversible myocarditis which creates those scars we were just told makes our body work less efficiently and should be avoided. The fact that this has come out after all the heinous revelations about the covid vaccines has put a serious dent in my love and trust of Kurzesagt.
1,so an autoimmune disorder is sort of like a mutiny
1,As a medical doctor I can confirm this is true
1,I see the sadly politicized topic of vaccines (specifically the covid vaccine) being pushed here. i am all for vaccines. however the covid vaccine was clearly rushed and lied about. Also big pharma should have never been allowed to profit this massively from a pandemic.
1,Just tell the pharmaceutical companies that We will be cured from all diseases. And then to look at you and say yeah I don't think so there's no profit in being cure
1,"I find funny that I got infected with Corona virus two times and vaccinated in between, yet I experienced mild discomfort and symptoms after vaccination rather than from natural infection. Biology and nature are weird"
1,"The virus doesnt cause your organs to get damaged, its your immune system doing that. Only happens if you're extremely sick tho, so dont worry if you only have flu like symptoms. And the best way to have a good immune system is by doing cold showers and living healthy (vitamine C&D). When you're sick its better to take natural remedies, rather than Ibuprofen."
1,Huge difference between actual vaccines and mRna hijackers.
1,"I'm having a baby and looking for pediatricians online. That led me to some forums of parents saying they didn't want vaccines for their babies. Some even said the didn't want the Vitamin K shot, which is not a vaccine.

Some people are so dedicated to misinformation, thank you for spreading the truth. Vaccines are extremely complicated and the big reason why so many children stay alive"
1,"Fun fact: there’s this fun Easter egg in the intro where normally the ape would be holding a phone, but this time it’s holding a virus"
1,It's so sad that we have a literal miracle (vaccines) and yet so many people either ignore their value or say they are bad. Those people never seem to realize they have NEVER met someone with small pox or polio....
1,Brought to you by Pfizer.
1,"Oh yeh totally, absolutely zero proof that mRNA vaccines cause no permanent damage. Tell that to my mum who had a massive flare up of her arthritus after each vaccine and now has bone spurs all over her body. Or to my friends brother who ended up in hospital from pericarditis and now has permanent damage to his heart muscles....at 21."
0,That music is fire firefirefirefire
1,We need a strategy game about the immune system in Kurzgesagt's art style
1,I really like hoe you depicted the video as a video game made it a lot more easier to relate and understand
0,Damn SOO you mean to say me eating 4000Calories while sick still wouldn’t spare all my muscle. SMH
1,"If your immune system is like a Pitbull with rabies, pocking it with vaccine may have deadly consequences... 

There is no accident that one of the first covid vaccine volunteers went down with transverse myelitis..."
1,"Paid for by Pfizer

TRIGGERED backhand_index_pointing_down"
1,I ordered one of your ant notebooks and I can’t wait for it to be here
0,"Give me a break,b.s. stop the madness. Your body is a perfect machine, but u have to look after it ,give up all your bad habits, and u will live ,so stop blaming your bad habits on other people, u are the keeper of your body, message to the devil fuck off."
1,just remember the vaccine mandates occurred to treat something that was artificially propagandized to coerce people into having a product that never stopped transmission or infection.
1,"Yes @Kuzgesagt, we should really take care of our cells. :D"
1,A Lancet study looked at 65 major studies in 19 countries on natural immunity. The researchers concluded that natural immunity was at least as effective as the primary Covid vaccine series.
2,"i love this immune system videos, keep up the good work! :)"
1,That old guy is why i still where a mask
1,Can you make a video explaining the body on immunosuppressants ? For those of us with autoimmune conditions.
1,So how much did Pfizer pay you for this ad?
1,"I will get vaccinated as soon as we finally surpass capitalism...I dont trust those who's intent is to create vaccines for profit...now we can see the side effects of overspeeding licensing and checking processes...as long as vaccine maker big corpos are compete with each other for profit, no thanks...cuz if the goal is to create profit and there are billions of dollars on stake, you can be damn sure that bribery and all of those things will roll on the table at the beginning....oh we just jump through some control protocols,  not so much...yea..."
1,"Vaccines that have been tested for several decades or longer, yes. Vaccine that's been rushed and is pretty experimental, no thanks. smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes"
1,"Your the reason I became a microbiologist, these types of videos are the reason I also love immunology. When are we gonna get a Neutrophil plush?"
1,I think this video is an add.
1,Another masterpiece about immune system!. I was so anxious for one more video of this topic. The other topics are great too though.
1,POV: drinking my coffee in the morning on vaca with my Kurzgesagt socks and shirt and seeing they posted a video smiling_face_with_hearts
0,Kinda messed up that you told me this while I was lying sick in bed
1,"Look, another one of those Bill Gates educational videos. I wonder what those wonderful billionaires are wanting to teach me today. Please, feed me with your graceful science as I am a faithful believer!"
1,They say that there's no one solution for climate change when it needs many and Kurzgesagt has quite a few solutions. Or at least reductions and it's better than sitting on our hands
1,I would like everyone to notice how amazing the music in this video is
1,"""I find that what doesn't kill you makes you very, very weak""
Norm Macdonald"
1,So the people with weaker immune systems are basically the rejected by the natural selection?
2,Thank you for making this so much more easier to understand
1,"Really pleased that while I served in the U.S. military, I was vaccinated for virtually everything. Also pleased with never having had a seriously bad reaction to any vaccine. Just sore arm syndrome, with an occasional fatigue and very occasional light fever."
1," no, I don't think I will"
1,What doesn't kill you... usually succeeds in a 2nd attempt
1,"mRNA vaccines are NOT the same as the vaccines that came before it

vaccines are more dangerous than you think"
1,Watching this while sick is quite the experience. Thanks Kurzgesagt!
1,"Great video about immune system. I actually bought your book.
Talking about ""carbon credits"", maybe you should make a video how scammy the carbon credit industry is at some point."
0,"What if some entity puts something dangerous / poisonous into the vaccine, like a Trojan Horse?"
1,Literatur no comstructive advice on how to improve your immune system other than getting vaccinated
1,Short answer: just take the damn vaccines
1,"Yes, well tested vaccines that aren't rushed and mandated by the government colluding with big pharma CAN in fact be a net positive...  the problem is the rest."
1,"Here with popcorn to read american's antivax comments, let's see how ignorant you guys can get!"
1,"thumbs_up

Great way to describe vaccines from fundamental, from humanistic fundamentals."
1,bill and gates in ur wallet sellout
1,"Hearing that my immune system does a lot of damage to your own body makes, and adding in think of your body like a country, makes me think my body is the Soviet Union in WWII face_with_tears_of_joy"
1,My uncle had covid and his almost all muscles melted his bones are showing
1,"The ability of the immune system to learn is absolutely incredible to me. I'm a high-school based singing teacher, and despite that high-risk setting, I've only caught COVID once so far. (I was vaccinated, and so had a mild case.) Since then, I've been exposed to it a few times, and it just doesn't stick to me. There's a particular type of sore throat I get which I now associate with a COVID exposure. But that's all that happens. Sore throat, maybe a slightly stuffy nose, and it's gone within 24 hours. What's more, I don't shed the virus. It doesn't show up on RAT tests, and my partner never catches it from me.

It's like my body was trained at the vaccine dojo, faced down the real deal after that training, and is now just an anti-COVID fortress."
0,Did I hear a Wilhelm Scream at ?
0,Lupus is seriously dangerous
1,"Kurzgesagt, Don't most of our oxygen come from the ocean? Shouldn't we be protecting the ocean more than trees?"
1,Fantastic vaccine shilling. Your donations fromBill Gates are doing great! clapping_hands_light_skin_tone
1,Love this video! The immune system is so fascinating but can be terrifying when it turns against you!
1,Once Kurzegesagt uploads in 4k60 fps.....ooooo chil'
1,"I've been assuming that people that have bad side-effects from a vaccine would be more likely to get seriously ill or die if they were hit by ""the real thing"".  Is this a reasonable assumption?  Like, if someone I know that doesn't trust vaccines much, gets vaxxed, and then complains that it made them sick so they're not going to get more vaccines, is it honest to tell them that if they DIDN'T get vaccinated, then they'd have gotten MUCH sicker than the average person if they got exposed to the virus?"
1," ""I HAVE HOLES!"""
1,The gorilla in the intro was eating a virus face_with_open_mouth
1,what about rna vaccines
1,"My immune system fought off coivd19...twice, and won. Here to Natural Immunity flexed_biceps"
1,"your guys’ videos teach me what teachers have failed to teach us in entire school units in just 10 minutes, all in an entertaining way. it’s incredible; this is one of my favorite channels"
1,"Vaccines are great, as long as they're SAFE. When big pharm starts putting junk in them to save money instead of doing it right, that's when you find out years later that it caused something else."
1,This one was really high quality with actually quite cute animations.
1,"Remember that Kurzgesagt is a state sponsored propaganda.
They may be right on lots of topic, but don't trust them on everything."
1,"Loved the video, until the false information about the coronavirus vaccine. Traditional vaccines work in the way you described, but not these new mRNA vaccines. Completely different, and very disappointing that you would spread misinformation."
1,"Vaccines are great. But mRNA drugs are not vaccines. They are lab engineered genetic therapies. They don't have the weakened to pathogen, but try to mimic it. Thus causing way more side effects."
1,"Oh dang.  I didn't realize that when you're sick, your body actually cannibalizes your muscles for resources.  Or that the patching process often leaves gaps in the cells that lowers organ efficiency.  That's nasty.  :o

Also, how does this apply to weak, but persistent diseases like the cold, I wonder?  Seriously, I've had a mild runny nose and sneeze for like 3 weeks now.  x_x"
2,That pixel art effect was nice!
1,"My body scared the hell out of me when it turned on me and began attacking me -- an autoimmune disease known as Ulcerative Colitis. I had a severe case of it that progressed very quickly and aggressively, nearly killing me in a matter of months. I no longer have a colon as a result of the 3 surgeries I underwent to save me.

 Could you please consider doing a video on UC and other similar IBDiseases?! grinning_cat
As far as I know, they're unfortunately not very well understood yet..."
1,"Please, please PLEASE! Translate quickly this vídeo to the ""Em poucas palavras"" Channel! Brasil is in need tô many vaccines from ignorance as we can possible get!!!"
1,"i have to say, the music in this video was exceptionally good :)"
0,Who’s watching this while sick? Lol
2,How much do you get paid for this propaganda lmao
1,how much of a stake does Kurzgesagt own in pfizer?
1,"Imagine an AI army structure mimicking the human immune system, and deploying the appropriate drones and troops for every threat."
0,Am i the only one that when gets sick gets stronger?
1,"Again, the key here is ""Serious Disease"""
1,Just reject everything the Pharma corporate scientism cult says and your immune system will be fine…
1,"Unfortunately, being green is just another way for companies to profit from the issue. If it was taken seriously by governments, greenify wouldn't be marketing and profits goals."
1,"I'm confused because If fever helps you fight of the virus, then why do we take fever pills and what even are fever pills because the fever will start when you have intruders and the fever pill gets rid of the fever, doesn't that mean the the pill is also fighting off the virus, so what is the difference between fever pills and normal pills"
1,"Your Advertisement is highly misleading as the Carbon Footprint of an individual does not matter in the grand scheme of things. Another way to show that the personal footprint is a dangerous concept is to look at who invented it in the first place. BP, the giant oil and gas company responsilbe for some of the worst natural disaster caused by humankind."
1,"are you going to make a game, cause a lot of metaphors you do are like games, just an idea would be cool"
1,"i literally got sick like 25 times a year and a result of that I became really skinny, good thing I go to the gym now, but now this kinda explains why I was so skinny."
1,This is why im fully vaccinated and very eager to get my 1st booster and i will continue to take all recommended boosters even if i have to take boosters for the rest ofy life
1,Oh yeah. I've got personal experience. Crohns disease... my gut bacteria in my colon looked a bit like an enemy to my immune system. It essentially carpet bombed it so hard it was in pieces... literally 6 hours to remove that shut surgically. No colon for me because immune response went full friendly fire.
1,step 1: don't take the fauci poison
1,"Just thank you government, my brother and sister both got covid shots and boosters my brother now weighs 130 lb he can't gain weight, my sister was a teacher, she doesn't want to teach anymore she doesn't want to do much of anything in fact she's thinking about a burial plot next to my parents. My wife my best friend was made to get shots from her employer, my wife is lost 135 lb, and this lethargic doesn't want to do anything. She don't even want to go to the store. All three of them are afraid of doctors! They will have to take me in a net kicking and swinging, I'm not going to drink the Kool-Aid bastards!"
2,"Again with this vaccine gimmick? What about exercise, good diet, good sleep, vitamins, sauna and cold baths?"
1,"I know, my immune system goes bonkers thinking pollen is a threat and it goes into a bloody rampage trying to attack a harmless air pollutants"
2,"I love how this is an ad for vaccines. Don't be a Karen, take them, fool."
1,Love these types of videos on the immune system. Always so nice get a unique view of how it all works especially now that i've been studying immunology at Uni. Even had a lecturer use the animations! Great work as always!
1,am i the only one who thinks the cells look like amonguses?
2,I love this content
1,WAS THAT MONKEY EATING THE INFLUENZA VIRUS
1,"Carbon offsetting is a scam. The carbon footprint at an individual level is minuscule and that very term was coined by BP, the same company that produces 415 TRILLION tonnes of emissions yearly."
1,"Wonder how much big PHARMA ""donated"" for this one???"
2,Very cool guys
1,It's a shame though that the adverse effects on young people for the Covid vaccines are more harmful than Covid itself
2,You guy’s are the best red_heart
1,The problem with the covid vaccine is that it is too premature for us to consider it to do better or worse to we normal citizen who doesn't have medical knowledge. I'm not against vaccine but I prefer wait grinning_face_with_sweat
1,We need to start a petition for kurzgesagt to make a strategy game based on the strategy games they show in their videos
1,RIP antivaxxers and anti climate change in the comments
0,Can the immune system fight cancer?
2,Yay more Kurt's!
1,"But this ""organ wounds"" can also happen with vaccines, right?"
2,This video is great and just what I needed. Thanks!
2,"The vaccine part isn’t entirely true! I just read a article from a science lab stating natural immunity is slightly better, because it’s harsher, the better it is for future resistance!! Anyway I loved the video and have a great day!!"
1,This channels deserves a lot more than just 20m subs! Keep up the  Good Work Birbs dove
1,It's a good thing I'm fat face_with_open_mouth
1,I can't believe I'm actually finding antivax comments
0,They always say you are always your worst enemy.
1,"Another amazing video.
Thank you so much for creating such engaging content on topics that are so relevant.
Education makes a big difference in saving lives.
Please continue doing videos with this excellent quality of work."
1,There is so much more you can do to boost your immune system versus vaccines. Life style and eating food that actually has nutrients in would do wonders for our society. Vaccines are good to some degree but as we see in current times they are a product produced by big pharma. Don’t trust people that want to make a buck or two off of you.
1,"Vaccines are great, if they work, the COVID vaccines don't work, you still get the bug and transmit it, and the risks are much higher that any other type of vaccine"
1, “Slippin’ Jimmy with a law degree is like a chimp with a machine gun!”
1,If you never had antibiotics would your immune system be strong?
2,I wish you addressed the impact of a good nutrition
1,"This video was kinda lame, the first point of actually resting & trying to avoid any illness (since they don’t make you stronger & powering through is unhealthy) was good, but that vaccine segment should have been much shorter & included the part about rest.

This video would have been WAY better discussing all the typical things people recommend (Vitamin C/D, Zinc, NAC, Echinacea etc.) and discussing which work (like Zinc) and debunking which don’t (like Echinacea)

I get it might have been controversial amongst the insane people, but we need to stop letting them dictate content. The majority out here just want to learn about what’s snake oil and what can actually help, and you failed to teach us much in this video. That implicitly supports all the misinfo out there"
1,"Funding by multi generational eugenics billionaires is disappointing.  Bought several of your books and watched most of your videos.  Now that you are fully a world health organization narrative operative, its disappointing we have to unsubscribe.  

We are already inundated 24/7 with propaganda.  Sadly, one of the best channels at explaining and illustrating complex issues is no longer on humanities side.  Sad day for everyone."
2,I was actually touched by learning how my good cells are defending my body. Damn! We should do our best to help them.
1,"I still wait for second part of ""Immune"" book :) any spoiler or plan to do that?"
0,I'm sick right now. Thanks!
0,Who's here after being sick face_with_tears_of_joy
1,"Problem is trusting the vaccine makers. Sometimes they are motivated by money, power or something else instead of our health."
1,Whoever says that “makes you stronger” quote clearly doesn’t have allergies.
1,Any one see the Kung Fu panda reference.
1,"I have a certain condition. It's always funny when some new age yogurt weaver tells me I need to boost my immune system, and  I have to point out that my condition is a result of my immune system being so boosted."
1, - I had to play this section twice because I heard that iconic scream from that old western and it's still hilarious!
1,Can K do a video on Jeffery Epstein?
1,"Wow, who literally funded you to keep pushing vaccines. This starting to feel like dealers pushing drugs. Vaccines have their place but I noticed a very worrying trend of peddling them for many things."
2,Only Kurzgesagt can make me interested in science
2,Currently watching this while I have Covid xD
1,So this is basically a vaccine ad
1,i was a really fat boy than i got typhoid and after a month i lost nearly 20kg. I never got fat again. I cant thank the disease but ....... i like being fit
1,i feel satisfied with the amount of replies i have made and i desire to see the debates that occur :3
1,Vaccines have to be very carefully tested or they will have detrimental side effects
1,"If only some werent making huge profits on vaccines, making those more questionnable for some people on wether they are really made for our best interest or just maintain an illusion in order to sell some stuff... Because on the covid case, some really seemed inneficient (""might protect against the most dangerous effects, but dont prevent transmission, have to take a booster shot every three weeks etc..."") and a lots of country took huge amounts of additionnal debt in order to pay these for their population. So if this video is trying to boost pr on vaccines, maybe explaining their benefit for health isnt the only important dossier... Also there are many illness you can get vaccinated against (yet)."
1,"This is a beautifully done video, however the vaccine segment seemed more like an add brought to us by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. Vaccines are not as mild and without risk as portrayed in this video. I know a lot of people who’ve suffered severely from them. Please consider editing this part to be more in line with the current available evidence. I’d hate for someone to get hurt because they weren’t fully informed of the risks."
1,Pfizer employees themselves have said that natural immunity to covid is MANY times stronger than their vaccine
1,I read somewhere that some depression is caused by your brain being in disease mode when you are in fact healthy. An evolutionary price to pay for a hightened immune system alertness.
1,"Wait, you're not gonna mention how the mRNA covid vaccines are different from the classical vaccines that you were talking about? Not doing that while mentioning vaccines and covid 19 in the same video is highly misleading."
1,early!
1,Every time I see a Kurzgesagt video I want a game based on it
1,Miss me with any vaccine that hasn’t undergone decades of testing tho :3
2,I havent been sick for 7 years
1,"This video and whole channel is a perfect example of malinformation , by which I mean that there are a few very meaningful truths drowned in a bunch of half truths and somewhat biased technical opinions leaving the viewer with a very incomplete and incongruent understanding of what the issue is about or how to grasp the connecting subjects. Now I understand why some people are upset at this content being funded by the World Health Organization. 
PS - Covid didn't killed young children , the vaccine did , and the elderly didn't survived it because of genetics but were rather more susceptible to it because Covid was made to bypass their immune response memories !"
1,"You guys you be tasked with making interactive text books.
Properly compensated of course and only if the crew found satisfaction in it."
1,"When my parents were young, there were frequent health talks on cholera, diphtheria and polio. Not anymore now.

When I was young, there were frequent health talks on tuberculosis and measles. Not anymore.

I wish my children would say in future, when we were young there was this thing called covid and pneumococcal that we had frequent talks about. Not anymore."
1,"Oh right, I haven't finished the book yet!"
1,So many trolls in the comments skull
1,"Im not an anti-vaxxer by any means but my immune system in particular has always reacted far more violently to any vaccine than just getting the illness naturally...  All my life... Every time... but I still get SOME vaccines even though it is worse for me >.>

Makes me kinda think just like some people might have different levels of immunity to different diseases there also is probably a spectrum of vaccine viability, tho obviously the majority benefit far more from the vaccine side of things"
1,The filthy fucking plague spreaders who willing spread the COVID infection should be legally fined and socially ostracized
2,This came out at the best time after that Woody Harrelson SNL monolgue lmao
1,Gotta give a Pat on the back for my amine system
1,"To all the people out there, go get the book Immune. The founder of Kurzgesagt wrote, it's fantastic, it even has pictures, and wow, the animation just keeps getting better."
1,It is mentioned that the inmunity that is generated by the effect of vaccination is better because it's engineered to make your body respond more efficiently. How is this effect achieved?
1,"This title really sounds like you would be talking about autoimmune diseases, I would love a video about that."
1,"I think i saw this video name few mins named diffrently: ""how to boost your immune system"" or something"
1,What an awful cick-baity headline.
1,TOO BASIC FOR ME. [DiowE]
1,Why do they call mRNA a vaccine?
1,"When I got the J&J vaccine, I learned that it uses a Adenovirus with modified spike-proteins, which meant that I essentially launched a false-flag-attack on my own immune system face_with_tears_of_joy"
1,Should I always get sick every 2 months
0,Damn you're right
1,This video falls flat when you realize Kurzgesagt receives a large portion of its funding from the Bill and Malinda Gates Foundation.
0,"If influenza bad, why so cute?"
1,So basically: Vaccines + Climate change...
1,"Suffering from Auto immune disease, no muscle nd always tired"
1,...so vaccines ? Name is a clickbait
1,"A lot of good stuff here, but amazing too the propaganda of the most recent vaccine being a boon. As well as some misleading claims about young people dying from ""Covid"" versus the vaccine.

Charlie has already gone over the issues with this channel's funding/agenda. I'd advise many to look up that video"
1,"""crazy agressive chimps with machine guns"". 

That can make a great movie"
1,"Climate change is not a problem and it is also not a problem we can fix. 
The main emmiters of green house gases are in asia and latin america. We will not be able to change their economies to go green because these are poor countries. They dont give a middle-finger about climate change because they are poor. The only way to fix the mind inconvenience of climate change is to have scientific and technological advancements which will provide the energy which is not only clean but cheap."
0,Kurgesagt talk about how getting sick naturally kills cancer cells from our body! It’s very interesting.
1,climate change? ask Greta about that! even she laughs about it!
1,"i thought i was watching an informative video about the immune system, until i realized it's just vaccine propaganda. notice how the whole video builds up towards vaccines by instilling a sense of fear and distrust in your own immune system. the immune system may not be perfect, but it is very capable of protecting you if you live a relatively healthy lifestyle."
0,I defeated herpes all the time
1,A few more years and we'll have animations for all the chapters from immune (the book). Great refresher :)
1,"Havent watched the video yet but didnt you said in ur book that ""boosting"" ur immune system is dumb?"
2,I have yalls book on the immune system and I love it :)
1, i can literally smell the anti-vaxxers complaining
1,5% of dislikes. 5% of people take seriously reason versus mystification. That's a good sign. 5% is more than enough to prevent other episodes of dictatorship in the future. One million sheep don't make one sigle fox.
1,Yea miss me with this one victory_hand
2,God I wish my lectures on medical faculty were like this... I would finish it in 4 years instead of 8. Literally perfection!
1,"Would be nice if you mentioned that not all vaccines are the same, esp since you picked covid as an example. Hopefully time will tell but, I would not put mRNA and traditional vaccines in the same bucket as they are very different in how they function and distribute in the body. Some studies even argue these micro scars are created by the mRNA vaccine in all of your body due to the small size of the isolated spike protein and the RNA sequence itself not being kept for reaction with immune system at injection site. (Something normal vaccines do as the particles are too big to escape the muscle into the bloodstream)"
1,"Your next Ep should be on Wren, or equivalents."
0,Saying a vaccine is like a fight with toy weapons while infection is a fight with real weapons is too simplified. You should have added that that is how it should be and how it is most of the times but not always.
1,wait did this video really said that vaccine induced immunity is better then the natural immunity because I am sure the natural immunity is a lot better. 8.10 
1,Can you do a video on fentanyl and opioids?
1,"Decent video but it feels incomplete sadly. Vaccines and cigarette smoking cessation aren't the only ways to boost your immune system. Pursuing a healthful diet and a good exercise/workout regimen, not to mention getting plenty of quality sleep and vitamin D from adequate sunlight exposure also can greatly boost your immune system."
2,Ok so the thing our bodies have been doing forever is bad now? Sure
1,"The Channel needs a documentary show on Netflix, hulu or something like these are TOOOO GOOOD tired_facetired_facetired_face"
1,My month is always brighter with your videos
1,Oh so others gain immunity overtime huh
1,"first time i thumbs down, you didn't actually give us any ways to boost our immune system, i was really excited but felt let down tbh"

1,Russia the 24 february 2022: 
1,fucking deadset sometimes you think there's good in the world. Then ya find out it's sponsored by some fuckwit billion air known for monopolizing markets and getting told NO. Also for using Africa as a testing ground for medicine and giving fucking African kids polio. Kick the gates foundation and any other scummy corrupt corporate wankers pushing an agenda.
2,why do I feel like this is propaganda?
1,Tell me about it...I have Lupus and I almost went out a few times.
0,Live in the nature dojo.  We fight to the death grinning_squinting_face
1,"I have two comments:
a) Another thing we could do is stop creating viruses that k millions of people. 
b) The risk benefit analysis of v is complicated, which is why it used to take decades to develop one. Big pharma is extremely corrupt too. Blanket statements and one rule solutions produce many ded bodies."
1,"The amount of conservative jerks in this comment section is disappointing, yet unsurprising."
1,this video brought to you by dr fauci
1,"its very irritating to witness humanity at large... i have so much faith in the minority that propels us, but i am so tired of how comparatively small that minority is...
sometimes i wonder whether humanity is worth the work of those who we depend on... most of us are still living in the stone age"
1,Carbon footprint is a fraud by corporations to push the responsibility for emissions onto people. Sad to see Kurzgesagt fall for it.
1,Hmmm I wonder what my body does when I don't sleep much?

1,Not the most interesting or original video… but at least it didn’t cover more climate alarmism!
1,Hi people grinning_face_with_sweat
1,"Anytime I go to get a vaccine I will now refer to it as ""going to the Dojo"""
1,I'm only here for the antivax comments but I'm surprisingly not seeing much. loudly_crying_face
2,I enjoyed the video!! And I want a Korean version of this video as fast as I can!!
1,Funny I’m sick today with a strap throat lol
1,"Please youtube, we need to get this to everyone's home page"
1,I hope you've vetted Wren and made sure they're not just another billionaire pet project designed to sell carbon credits to giant industry polluters.
1,"Hey, Kurzgesagt I was wondering what the team thinks of the Willow Project?"
1,"As someone with MS, I agree with the title!"
1,"Can someone explain WHY there is so much bad bacteria, viruses, and such for us humans?"
1,Was one of my favorite channels until it turned into a Pfizer advertisement
1,By posting this video they will never get a sponsor from the 0.9℅ of germs
1,Kursgesagt this is the 6th time you brought the human immune system to show and tell
1,This is the final Kurzgesagt video I will ever watch. Unsubscribed and will no longer support this propaganda.
1,"This came out just in time, I Just got a strep throat lol face_with_tears_of_joy"
1,"I have an Autoimmune Disease ( 44 yrs ) .. which is good and bad ... it ( immune system ) works but doesn’t know when to shut down .. I’m on a immunosuppressant.. which means I need to be very , very careful now .. ugh !"
1,"Mom had a very strong immune system (barely got really sick) and was only sick for 2 days at most when she did get sick. 
She developed an autoimmune disease a few years back and her immune system destroyed almost every organ systematically. The body is terrifying."
1,"If you still believe in ""Germ"" theory, then I guess this would make sense to you. However, it is erroneous and lacking.
Terrain Theory is the accurate approach and easily verifiable.  Your video misses this prudent approach. There is zero mention of anything else you can do, such as keeping a healthy weight, staying fit through cardio or strength training, keeping your vitamin D levels above minimum, proper hydration, and many other things.
It's the reason I have been a healthy person for all of my life and how I have helped others through my proffesion and general interaction.  My neighbor thanked me for a simple solution to her digestive issues that her ""experts"" hadn't offered.  
Dump the archaic, profit driven models if you want good health and adopt the apt Terrain Theory(Fact) model and you'll be helping people over profit."
1,20 millions subs I got here when there 7 millions subs congrats
2,I love the Joker painting in the background at  red_heart
1,"I changed my gut microbiota to improve T and B cell differentiation so they are better able to train against infection, and also manage to get my scar tissue to reverse and regenerate as normal tissue, having regained hair in places on my head where wounds from childhood had occurred. I did this to solve the problems driving Crohn's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis. I have been in remission for over a year now and am seeing a constant stream of clinical trials coming out that prove I was right about the mechanisms.

I also improved my innate immune function to better resist initial disease by improving mucus barrier function and natural production of antibacterial and antiviral compounds, as well as maintain a healthy gradient of hydrogen peroxide production in my gut."
1,"This is just another example of their fine work. Kurzegesagt explains these topics so clearly and consider many different perspectives. Thank you for your educational, interesting content"
1,Myocarditis...
1,i sadly got the nature dojo since i was too young to be allowed to get the vaccine against covid
2,Tremendous. Thank you for producing this.
1,"I'm just recovering from Covid and this was constantly on my mind. I decided not to overthink it and now, this video dropped... Damn :)"
1,"A lot of underlying messages here, those who know they know..."
1,"bro i want to lose some muscle mass and he just told me how but in the unhealthy way

so if you do not eat for several days your body becomes weaker? leaves your immune system with less defence to spare energy or something like that which would lead to you at some point getting sick i just made the (get sick glitch) in real life"
1,This is just a fancy vaccine commercial
1,"It's nice of Kruzgesagt to do these videos but the problem is that antivaxxers don't just ""not know"" how vaccines work, they're just convinced everything is a conspiracy against them."
1,"While I like the explanation in this video of how the immune system works and the consequences of overcoming a disease, even a common cold, you still didn't give any ways of how to actually boost the immune system. This is the first Kurzgesagt video I've ever disliked..."
1,Cordyceps dislikes this video
2,Chef’s kiss
1,Nobody is an anti-vaxxer!
1,"Guys, please, I need this soundtrack. Is it not been published?"
1,ahhh im glad to see the monkey has his thematically appropriate item back
0,I literally got sick today :S
1,"This channel has very interesting and educational videos.
Apart from the fact that they mistakenly confuse the mRNA anti-covid jabs with vaccination and seem to take climate change seriously, this video is also enlightening.
I seriously hope Klaus Schwab didn't penetrate 'Kurzgesagd'"
1,"What do you have to say about Covid vaccine? Or that flu vaccines need to be different every year? Was surprised seeing such agenda propaganda here. I’m not antivax, but this video just reminds me of covid histeria"
1,Feels like a video sponsored by Pfizer.
1,How much did big pharma pay you to make this vid face_with_tears_of_joy
1," except if its an mRNA vaccine.
 again, not if its an mRNA vaccine."
1,What’s up with the measles graph?
1,NATURAL IMMUNITY >
1,big pharma and bill gates money at work
1,But all vaccines have mercury and microchips and are made to cure fake illnesses. face_with_tears_of_joy
1,I like these videos and although I am not going to be getting the jab I appreciate how this video didn't do a hard sell of it like many other videos have it is promoted without being insisted on
1,Would you guys make a video on how the antibiotics work it would be an intersting video i think
1,"This channel is a propoganda machine, and is one step away from being legacy media.  Look up how kurzgesagt is a propoganda machine for billionaires on YouTube.  Unsubscribed."
1,Really fascinating!
1,Watching this video with all its war-references from Ukraine be like: 
0,"A 60 FPS ANIMATED VIDEO, FUCKIN HELL ITS GOOD"
1,"“Sometimes, what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.” Definitely learned this the hard way, our family is very prone to auto immune problems and we’re all dealing with some kind of chronic fatigue, skin problems, brittle nails and hair and sometimes even hair loss. I have a badly affected nervous system as well, dealing with a really bad case of POTS. For me, these problems gradually developed overtime, but got big KICKS in the back from Pfeiffer when I was around 13, and then the whooping cough when I was 15 to make every underlying problem even worse.

But somehow, we all seem to have a collection of these problems of just the right amount of severity to make life difficult, but not enough to threaten death. smiling_face_with_tear It’s the limbo of lucky and unlucky, we are not sure. (Wait, no, I do have a nephew that does have the right severity for it to be dangerous, but god bless modern medicine I guess.)"
1,Funded by billionaires
1,"The earliest known ceramics were made in China 20,000 years ago."
1,I wish I’d learned about the permanent damage getting sick can do to you when I was in high school. I think I would’ve been more careful about my health and getting sick
1,We could solve climate change if Corporations stopped polluting the environment.
1,When I get sick I get extremely hungry and can eat like crazy.
1,"Just before watching the video, I looked at the name and thumbnail, and I already knew the topic.

1,First thing I noticed with this vid..... great soundtrack : )
1,"i've probably watched and loved all your videos. this is the first that  i have downvoted. ""just get vaccinated"" ? duh?!? but that's not very useful is it?"
2,ha!ha! ok we've got the innuendo
1,"It's misinformation to say ""seemingly very healthy young people died from covid"".  Mentioning a statistical anomaly in this way makes it sound common when in actuality it only happened a handful of times."
1,"this channel's funded by Bill Gates. NO surprise he thinks natural immunity is nothing and vaccines are the way to go, when research shows natural immunity is stronger than vaccine. Propaganda at its peak"
2,"Vaccinate and help your own body, and it will help you back red_heart"
0,How the fuck you knew i was sick??
1,Kurzgesagt has become so amazingly good recently! This one in particular constructs new concepts upon information provided in previous videos. They also connect more of their videos together in the end. This is incredible science education microbe rocket
0,Watching this while my body fights an influenza war...
2,what happened with u guys and brilliant?
0,I love how the is man can change being sick to a whole war front in your body happening
1,"In future videos, could you guys specify what you mean when you say ""smoking""? Do you mean tobacco? Cannabis? Any smoke whatsoever?"
1,"The saying is ACTUALLY: ""What doesn't kill me, will likely try again."""
0,"What a whole load of bullshit, all of you young people getting sick right and left its because you impaired your immune system with the clotshot! No refunds, not my problem & I hate the antichrist."
1,This video came 3 years too late now didn't it. grinning_face_with_sweat
0,I am current my suffering from a cold D:
1,What a funny thing I'm sick right now
1,I LOVE the musical callbacks to previous videos.  One of the feelsgoodman parts of most Kurz videos.
1,"I guess if you're already vaccinated there's nothing you can do?
These videos are getting worse and just clickbaity re-hashed stuff now.  Also these ""carbon offset"" companies are a SCAM.  You pay money for them to make money and offload the carbon burden to someone else, you are just paying to feel better about yourself and that's it."
1,"We may overcome disease for good? 

Yeah, I'm pretty sure humans have made this claim for about 10,000 years. 

Looks like it's always been wrong."
1,"Great episode! Love the animations as always. Bad choice of sponsor though, pretty sure carbon offset doesn't at all help the situation of climate change and has been proven so many times. Your money is probably better spent directly funding those Tree Growth groups, saving for solar panels or buying a pen and paper to write a letter to your local Politicians to make a change."
1,"So not talking anything about diet, exercise, exposure and other ways to naturally strengthen your immune system? Not here saying that a smoothie and a sauna will make measles-vaccine irrelevent, just that alongside with a healty life-style you will certainly be more resilient. Would have been great to hear more of the benefits of and how such a life-style could look like: what foods, rutines, activites etc are actually prooven to boost your immune system. Kind of a let down from you guys to be so one-sided on this matter!"
1,90% of people I know didn’t take the covid vaccine. Even after friends and family died. Sigh.

People following his advice: Hahaha I can rule the world now!!!
Kurzgesagt realising what they just did to people: (Screaming inside)"
2,"I loved this, the animation was hilarious and totally on point, thanks so much! <3"
1,pov : me looking at my fresh knife cut grimacing_face
1,Why is no one talking about how the whatever they’re called the things that notifier immune system did don’t correct me about my spelling it’s speech to text OK why did the Cowboys do I yeah but those things that notify the immune system like little among us is
1,"i request a video about personalities what are they ?  , and if  are they acquired or passive (born that way)"
1,This turned into a vaccine pimping video? Imagine how mad people are going to be at you in a few years when the truth comes out.
1,My immune system prob couldn't kill a fly lol I get sick like every few months
1,"what if the vaccines gives me scars on my heart? and why isn't there anything in here about being healthy, working out, eating right, not being a fatty?"
1,Looks like they got a new source for info after it was found that they have just 1 source and it’s sponsored by the bill and Melinda gates foundation
1,unsubbed fuck this funded crap ok lets say sicknesses leave a scar most of our organs can heal over time this video probably talks about 0.0000001% of the people
1,"Yeah... Except I'm a healthy person and after I got the
Covid vaccine booster I've been getting sick every few weeks to a couple months and the sicknesses will last from a week to a month. This has been happening for about half a year now. I'm not saying it's the vaccine but my body has never acted this way in my entire life and I can't think of any other changes I've made to my life. I used to only get sick once or twice a year for about 1 to 3 days before I'm completely better. Now I'm constantly sick and my body takes wayyyy longer to recover over simple sicknesses like colds and flus."

0,What the hell happened in the 90s 
1,bet your connect to a pharmaceutical company?
1,"Quite disappointing the only 2 elements discussed to boost your immune system was genetic lottery or vaccines. Would’ve been nice if they mentioned what one can do to help boost their immune system e.g diet, exercise, weight management and vitamins crying_face"
1,This is amazing
1,"This is why ""health"" products that claim to ""boost your immune system"" are garbage. Your immune system doesn't need boosting"
1,Congratulation for 20M clapping_handsclapping_hands
2,Don't buy into the mRNA bullshit
1,soo what doesn't kill you.. reduces your organ's functions
1,"Disappointed with video! No timestamp of this video the author say words such as 'Exercise', and/or 'Fitness'. Vaccines and process of Vaccination is sometimes the only way to get out of infectious diseases however Keeping your body fit and healthy through exercise and proper diet also assist that process. If the author is mentioning 'vaccine science' then author also should mention about 'Kinesiology'. It is difficult but not impossible to know the person's immune system response on the scale that is shown in above video. Through proper diet and good habits of life such as exercise, non-drinking, non-smoking, can certainly do provide understanding of whether the person has good immune system or bad one to begin with. (with the exception of hereditary immune issues). Please, keep unbiased view on science topic do not bring 'woke' political agendas."
1,"See, anti-vaxxers? ""Naturally"" becoming immune is NOT the best option."
1,Thank you for picking up on climate change
1,"PORTUGUES BR (PT-BR) PLEASE, I NEED A SEE THE CHANNEL"

2,"Wow, I didn't know that about scars."
2,"Checking in with Ulcerative Colitis (well managed thankfully). Yes, your immune system can be a jerk lol"
1,I know you are passionate about climate change and quality of life. Please look into planting empress trees as they sequester 26x the amount of carbon as regular trees. Only 4 trees per person and global warming is neutralized!
1,"I would love to see a video on how the immune system can make mistakes. It was mentioned but not expanded on. 

Seeing like myself (Lupus -SLE) many people in the comments have immune disorders. It would be nice to see what we likely know but in your cool voice and wonderful graphics. 

Plus it would be wonderful to be able to share the video to explain to those that don’t understand our disorders."
1,"I have an autoimmune disease, MS. Im well aware of how dangerous the immune system can be."
1,How much did bill gates pay you to further his agenda?

Anyone know what’s actually in them yet?"

1,"If a man is really fat, does the body take resources from that instead of muscles?"
1,Wait for it....wait for it.... vaccines.
1,After all I heard on kurzgesagt I don't like how it is normalizing war economy in its discourse. The implications here are unwelcomed.
1,"My grandpa has had a stroke twice, has Alzheimer’s and is 97. He managed to survive Covid three times!"
2,"Not going to lie, was kind of hoping for an immune system boosting tip that wasn’t vaccines. Oh well, good video regardless"
1,wonder how much bill gates paid for this video
1,If you are anti-vax but you take other medication or smoke or drive or walk outside past 10 pm or go swimming in still water lakes or eat burnt food (etc.) then what is the point? Why are you willing to risk your life in all these other cases but not get vaccinated?
1,After Corona vaccines lost innocence.
2,You have made my childhood a blessing throughout the years and through covid i want to thank you and your team for making me love science and want to have the skills much love
1,I like that you are making very good videos I also think that you should make a video about what took so long to make a video about the language of life
1,"Wilhelm at !  That made me smile.
I had to back up and listen a couple times, but it's there."
1,This video also seems clearly political and certainly 'pushy' in its message.. The Hated One's vid made sure I'll never enjoy one of these ever again
1,"Oh no... the trigger word ""vaccine"" was used. LOL!"
1,I'm still not getting vaccinated against COVID-19.
1,Let's not even talk about me eating a peanut...
1,"“How to train your immune system”
Serious part of my brain: Vaccines!
Silly part of my brain: Eat lots of dirt for exposure!"
1, - hmm... haven't studies overwhelmingly shown that natural-COVID resistance is way better than mRNA-treatment-COVID resistance?
1,Honestly I was hoping for something I bet less obvious than “get vaccinated” though I understand the target audience is not people like me
1,"I'm watching this video while having a cold. And I know exactly why I have a cold, exhaustion in combination with cold weather."
2,"Lol. Brought to you by Pfizer, I am sure."

*laughs in anti-vaxxer Karen*"
1,Good vid but that commercial at the end just sounds like buying indulgences imo.
1,"I guess nobody will read this, but since i got vacinated 1 year ago, life has been hell. I got sick alone in this 1 year probably 15 times. I dont mean mean just catching a cold or a running nose. I mean feaver and infection. Before the vacine i never got sick, maybe twice a year at max. Im 20, male and Helpless. I lost all my gym process because of that, im losing weight,.. Please help :("
1, any factorio player knows this
1,"I find these videos so comforting, and not just because of the video's theme, and gentle voice. A year ago I decided to take another year of biology, and I have learned lots. It's videos like these that prove to me, that I have learned something new, and it is that, that is comforting."
1,"At the end of the day I'd just say,
Most sicknesses are passive and when you feel like shit from one, it's almost always your body responding"
1,"I'm not anti vaccines... however, the last one is way worse than the infection itself."
1,"So this channel is straight up a sanitized propaganda outlet now huh? 

the coof m RR En Aye is not a vaxxine"

1,"Considering all the things that can be done to boost immune system, you only chose to talk about one part of it, vaccines. Just kinda weird. Not even a mention of other scientific ways."
1,You know the thing with the corona vaccine is in my opinion not the best option either because the main problem is the test time. I only do vaccines if it's got tested 1 generation ago to know that it's not gonna have side effects after like 30 or 50 years.
1,me watching this with 39 degrees feathers: expressionless_face

1,from the beginning of this video I was thinking about Ukraine and it's invasion by moskowian orks...
1,"Kurzgesagt, idk how you did it
But I think I'm in love with Martie (Martie is the  girl in this video btw)"
2,thank you for this video.
1,A boosted immune system causes autoimmune diseases.
1,"So basically, the immune system is a automatic defence system, except it doesn’t have a recognition system so it just blasts whoever it sees when it is used"
2,This may be super random but I think a video on plate tectonics would be super cool :)
1,"I thought that the mention of refrigerant at the end of the video was interesting. It reminded me of a technology that was developed years ago that required no refrigerant. They were eventually termed ""acoustic chillers."" Really fascinating technology."
1,"Well - if we talk about proper vaccines it's ok - you know...those properly tested that will properly stop virus most of the time?

If we talk about fail vaccines like the covid one (and ofc we know from biology books and studies that if you dont stop transmission you will make virus stronger instead) - it's crap - statistic person_shrugging - it's super dangerous when more than 30/40%+ still get sick because that creates opportunity for the virus to evolve further person_shrugging"
1,And then there are people that deny vaccine...this is really sad.
2,Cope and seethe have fun with your myocarditis.
1,"Dang it! By the title, I was thinking that they are going to tell us the best diet or something to boost immune system. person_facepalming I am always searching for the same on google but can't find anything."
1,"first off, i have to say this much because there was a bit of misinformation regarding covid.
during the pandemic, we applied a bad treatment plan (this is worldwide, not just the states) that ended up killing dozens of times more people than it should. on top of this, the US and other Governments around the world incentivized hospitals to essentially make this bad treatment plan the standard of care when surviving covid-19 by providing funding for treatments and deaths.
this bad treatment plan was a combo of antibiotics and ventilator's. the cocktail of antibiotics was what killed a lot of people needlessly, and some nurses/doctors/hospitals didn't even practice safety instructions on the label, and overdosed people. this destroyed a lot of the functions of the body overnight and in some cases the liver was overloaded and later shut down.
the ventilators were another thing that killed people, mostly elderly tho. this is because the elderly have weaker lungs that when ill cannot resist the pressures of a ventilator as well, essentially ""blowing the lungs out"" sorta speak. many doctors and nurses can attest to the statements here, but as of right now the governments of the world don't recognize it as a bad idea, and will still tell people that covid killed those that we gave bad treatments to. a lot of the deaths from young, young adult and middle aged groups are the result of bad treatments applied to a illness we essentially panicked over instead of telling people to basically go home, drink a boatload of vitamin c or get some ensure and simply pray.
its a unfortunate thing that happened, but lets hope lessons were learned.

secondly, vaccines do not work well with the immune system at all, contrary to popular belief and medical belief.
over 1200 studies and counting are showing the real dangers when it comes to vaccines, the biggest danger is neurological and CNS damage. whats worse is we truly do not know the actual numbers of people who are affected by side effects, nor do we know the real number of side effects or even all of the side effects in general. this is due to a flawed medical system and government pushes for the stuff while suppressing side effects and devaluing the risks.
when you take a kid to get their MMR for example, you are essentially gambling your child just as much if not more so than a gamble with a virus and a lot of people cannot get vaccines due to a weakened immune system. the biggest problem is that in the US alone, for the VAERS reporting system, even tho it is federally mandated under US law that doctors submit side effects to VAERS, the Lazarus report estimated less than 1% of side effects on vaccines are reported.
even if the real figure is closer to 10 or 50 percent, there is still a gamble when it comes to vaccines.
this is because of the flawed medical system, and the governments of the world that supports it. i would not recommend making yourself or your child a lab rat for a flawed medical system and government.
the best way to protect yourself from viruses is basically the following actions:
1. just go outside, don't have to walk or bike but simply sitting outside under the sun for a few minutes a day is scientifically proven to kill off many airborne viruses and other invaders. this is because many viruses and bacteria are not immune to the UV rays and your body does convert sunlight to vitamin D.
2. get at least 8 hours of sleep. not a lot of people get between 7-9 hours of sleep for the immune system to properly function and even less people know about the healing benefits of REM sleep.
3. find out any vitamin and mineral deficiencies that you may have. your body works in a way that requires you to have certain vitamins and minerals to operate properly, if you have a deficiency in a vitamin or mineral it is not wise to leave it going on and the FDA has a laundry list of vitamin and mineral deficiencies that is often reported. this is something you don't simply do to your body but a lot of people are unaware they may have a deficiency a all, which is dangerous as some minerals and vitamins your body needs can very well be for the immune system. your doctor can do a test to see where you might be deficient in and recommend diet changes tailored to your needs.
4. get at least 15 minutes to a hour of exercise per day. not asking you to go to the gym and be a bodybuilder, but just a short 15 minute walk per day is okay and good for the body. the best time is early in the morning before and during sunrise, when your body is fully charged.
5. cut down on sugar as much as possible, replace with natural sweeteners such as honey when possible. this is because sugar is not something the body can easily intake, and it can be harmful to your body. sugary drinks and foods also can lead someone to develop addictions to the stuff, because it produces dopamine's in large quantiles.
6. finally try to keep your mental health up. when your mental health is down, your body is down. recent research into the brain-gut connection has revealed that your gut contributes a lot to your mental well being. this is because the gut has recently found to have neurons in it similar to the brain and its also where a good chunk of your immune system is stored as well. a bad or leaky gut is often linked to poor mental and physical health, and is not the best of ideas to have when it comes to it.
the best way to defeat such is to take up a diet of probiotic enriched yogurt, like antivia or other such yogurts with active probiotic cultures. yoga is another good contributor to good mental health, this is because yoga practices 2 main objective processes that is helpful to your mental and physical health. those processes are exercise, and breathwork.
theres a reason why your therapist is likely to recommend a breathing exercise to calm down, it is a universal thing humans do, and the more oxygen in the brain the more you can calm down after a heated argument with a friend or family member."
1,Don't fall for (((Kurzgesagt))) tricks and do NOT take experimental minimally-tested vacc like for cov19
1, Whats with the weird graph?
1,"Funny to watch this after reading Philipp's Immune book where it's said that to ""boost"" your immune system is a very bad thing. I'm just nitpicking the word itself tho as choosing a different word will likely take a another video to explain why. The video is great as always!"
1,Oh look another video sponsored by the gates foundation that wants to patent vaccines
1,"This is ocean of knowledge.
I already knew many things from your videos.
3 new things I learn.

1,As someone with Crohn’s Disease this episode hits close to home
2,Sweet they're selling indulgences!
1,You only talked about vaccines. What about other methods of keeping a healthy immune system? Like a healthy diet and a regular exercise routine?

1,"Wow, another really good video! The most amazing youtube channel still delivers."
1,Thanks Kurzgesagt for creating another eternal crisis in my mind
1,The immune system is kind of like chemotherapy. It is necessary to kill dangerous pathogens but also wreaks havoc on the rest of your body and leaves you with serious negative side effects...
2,hi i love you so much and i am from bulgaria
1,You forgot the relatively new research about how infections impact on the brain and its overall health.

not wanting so much backlash huh"
1,Sponsored by Pfizer and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Where's my check?
1,"so you made videos about immune response against bacteria, you basically covered all antiviral defenses in the cancer series, can you make a video about how the immune system fights against parasites?"
1,"Any way you look and think about your body it is an amazing piece of work. Your immune system can fight off any problems. It can work extra hard and after it has defeated the virus, it can see a vital organ as a foreign body. Them your own immune system can attack, like your heart, and attack it and can cause a lot of damage. Some  don't make it. I was one of the few that made it, with considerate damage. I pray for others like me.folded_handsfolded_handsfolded_hands"
2,"Good try, mixing really good and interesting videos with propaganda, this way most people take propaganda as truth."
1,Funny that this channel is a propaganda machine.
1,"99% Safe and effective, the most amazing miracle vaccine which causes more pain than good. I am all for vaccines and have had all the REAL ones, but the covid vaccine was nothing more than a complete scam! All the science is now showing that the 'conspiracy theorists' were right and all the scientists were wrong. Maybe in the future we stop silencing voices which oppose the main stream narrative and engage in real debates."

1,do you think we could get a video on the potential benefits of fasting?
1,"And all of this only because we want everyone to live on. I mean, this is a very beautiful endeavor. We go against natures way to protect the species because its way means the death of the 'weak' and the selection of the 'strong' (for whatever situation it may apply). Is there any science that studies the actual repercusions of this kind of 'softening'. At some point it was the immune system alone, now we train it while training it to be trained; is there a moment where we need to reemplace it cause it will be more cost effective than training it all the time? 
Also thanks for te work you guys put on this (although I sometimes feel you tell almost a religious truth, which would be a kind of perfect idea of 'whatever', and sometimes don't include(or not emphasize enough) other parts of the truth that describe reality also) Maybe making a 'Corruption and Conflict of interest' video would be complementary, cause I love humans and most of the things we achieve, but want to be honest about the dark parts of us too."
1,"I wish this channel focus on sciences and stop using it to push propaganda about vaccines that arent vaccines, and stay with the puré scienctist explaining like they did for Years, most videos Now are just about using sciences to make activism to make you think what they believe/or want. What a Shame, how one of the great onenhsve fall, well, they are european base, it's not shocking this happend."
1,"This video is way too short and is in need of regular up dates as important discoveries come in. It promotes vaccination without reference to the growing data that is changing the relative risk of catching the now endemic covid virus, against the risk of having the mRNA vaccine. No sign of an allergy test prior to vaccination being offered. We are left having to toss a coin on the decision. I am fully vaccinated. Switzerland has stopped its use completely. The UK restrict it to over 69's . You should satisfy yourself with your doctor that you have considered the known possible outcomes."
1,Can you please go back to engineering and space videos?
1,these videos should be uploaded in 4k :)
1,"New Kuzgesagt video, I’m officially happy"
1,"Well, technically kissing someone allows your immune systems to get into contact with theirs, and some exchange of knowledge happens, not very efficiently, but it's enough that couples can share immunities and long-term couples end up with very similar responses. So depending on the metric vaccines are technically the second best way to train your immune system, albeit still the more effective and safe."
0,"We can even fully kill of viruses so i never understood the saying ""whqt doesn't kill you, makes you stronger"" cause if the virus isnt killing you, then they just making you suffer"
1,"During hospital visits, I was repeatedly asked two questions:
1) am I a smoker?
2) do I have Type 2 Diabetes?
That was really what every nurse, doctor was concerned about. These things change the nature of the treatment, care and the expected outcomes.
Please do a video on what smoking and diabetes do to the body."
1,"ok now kurzgesagt joins the misinformation propaganda look the other way league :(

1,Kurzgesagt would like to take this time to tell you that actually your immune system is just fantasy (like Harry Potter) and to go get your seventh booster for Covid19 because it prevents transmission and Fauci is the GOAT.
1,"When are you going to do a video on failed ""vaccines"" and the problem of blindly trusting medicines that have no proven track record?

You can turn blind because of your own immune system"

Are you kidding?

Kurzegast, you are better than that. Yes, I have always supported vaccinations, and as you know as well as I do that a vaccine is as much of a gamble as it is a solution."

2,We should feel great about our immune system

Also I get paid leave from my employer for vaccinations, so there really is no downside. I think all companies should do that, even if its a small hit to productivity."

But damn was that fever I had the most outrageous fever in my life. The chills I had from the fever was so bad I felt cold underneath a thick blanket in an 80 degree F room all I did was sleep. Then for two days my fever never dropped under 100 and I felt normal again.
1,does allergies have the same effect?
1,So theres Ww1 and 2 like wars going on inside my body!
0,"Pfizer ad? How low you sunk, Kurzgesagt. Shame."
1,"Great video with one glaring flaw. At  -- ""no scars, no permanent damage"", which is unfortunately false. As is well understood in the field, the immune response to many types of vaccination does indeed leave the same scars and damage, though usually to a lesser degree compared to live infection. In the case of mRNA vaccination, there are more scars and damage left on average compared to the more traditional types of vaccines due to the proliferation method requiring the hijacking of healthy cells in these organs. For macro-level visibility of this phenomenon, see mRNA-induced myocarditis and associated symptoms. Do note that acknowledgement of this fact is not advocacy for avoiding vaccination, obviously."
1,Can we have a straight up positive video from Kurzgesagt containing the info from the book Factfulness and similar? That would be wonderful.
0,Think it's weird our bodies evolved to nearly kill us to keep things from killing us and sometimes it can be what kills us anyways

1,"One of your most iconic soundtracks ""vaccines"" played at the end of this vid. It is so good and fitting."
1,the fact that this videos doesn't have a lot dislikes means that anti-vaxxers don't have the necessary attention span to watch a science video until the end to find the answer.
1,Is there another immune video that got deleted?
1,"I'm living this now. I got pneumonia just over a year ago and was hospitalised. By the time they diagnosed it and got antibiotics in me, it had spread across half of my left lung. Before that I was relatively healthy, but ever since - even over a year later - I now struggle to breathe sometimes and any little cold makes it hard to get enough oxygen. I'm only in my late 20s but I'll probably have weakened lungs for the rest of my life now, all because I picked up a bug from the electrician who came to repair the light switch."
1,Spectacular as always flexed_bicepsI hope one day to reach your level with my channel blue_heart
1,"Respectful feedback:
1. Should have mentioned antibiotics, and their role.
2. Good tested vaccines (7-10 year old trials) are a great idea. MRNA untested genetic therapies / vaccines are q of a questionable quality dojo."
1,"I am not anti-vac, I aggree with the content, but it is very bland, PSA level, this channel has gone downhill. There is nothing interesting anymore. Unusubbed."

1,":/ As lovely as this is I currently have the flu on day 8 now. I get vaccinated every year for it including this one. I know I ""responded well"" to the vaccine because I felt sick af for 2 days after getting it. I feel awful. This isn't to discredit vaccines, though. What went wrong in my case is that I got the Flu right after either Covid or a cold. Which I handled with mild - moderate symptoms. Slept a fair bit.

Nah, what's spooky is wondering just how much worse it would have been if I hadn't gotten vaccinated. :/"
1,"Sometimes, it makes me wonder which is better, a non sensitive immune system or an ultra sensitive immune system..and more often than not, it's the immune system that actually kills us."

1,Why did they change the name of the video?
1,"Considering I’ve been sick for the past 5 days, this is honestly the best video that could’ve been posted.

Thank you Kurzgesagt heart_suit"
1,"I'm sick while watching this... a sore throat, stuffy nose, and coughing... this sucks. (not the video, it rules)"
1,"Dear Kurzgesagt, talking about strong immine system, can you consider a possibility for making a video about cold showers/ice baths? Its becoming more and more popular, and we would love to hear your analytical view on this topic."
1,wait is this whole video just a way to promote getting the covid vaccine..bruh
1,"The amount of ""oohh, Bill Gates"" or ""hmmpph... yeah, but (insert big pharma/ conspiracy theory)"" comments is staggering on here! 
Vaccines are proven by science. You can't just pick your own facts! Unless you trust conspiracy nonsense more than science? 
What terrifies me is that even when Kurzgesagt make a superbly clear, logical and completely non-political video to explain something, so many people still just blurt out ""yeah but Bill Gates/communism/ whatever"". One noticeable trait in about 90% of these comments is poor levels of basic English, spelling and grammar. Perhaps Kurzgesagt could do some more work on fact-checking and why a big slice of humanity seems to have a problem with educating themselves? If only there was a vaccine for this!"
1,"I wish we could get to the point where we’re allowed to listen to our bodies telling us to slow down and rest when we’re fighting off and infection, rather than pushing through because we must be productive at all costs."
1,"It would be very interesting to hae a video on what to do about your immune system when you have an autoimmune disease. There is a lot of research being done about these various ailments, but there isn't much in the way of actually effective, long-term treatments, let alone cures. And the impact of having an autoimmune disease on contracting and recovering from other kinds of diseases."
1,"Disappointing. I love Kurzgesagt videos, but I have the feeling it's becoming a propaganda machine.

Boosting your imune system - vaccines

What about sports, sleep, diet, weight ?

Or are you not allowed to show it?"
1,I was 7 when my immune system targeted my own platelets. Pretty scary stuff.

1,"Clever, you manage to dodge the risk of quick made vaccines by simply saying you covered it in another video. Despite the likelihood that people have not watched it, nor care to. Thus, convincing people covid vaccines were the best choice without actually giving all the information as a true informational group should."

1,comparing yourself to a country and immune system to an army is genius
1,".
The best way to train your immune system is to ""go outside and eat a spoon full of dirt""

Kids are too sheltered these days, combine that with STUPID doctors who give out antibiotics like candy on Halloween and you get the world we live in now where everybody's allergic to everything or is too weak to deal with even a common cold....
I call it ""Darwin's revenge"""

1,"And even if you're lucky enough to survive an infection/illness, there is still a chance you will get Post Viral Syndrome which often leads to life long chronic illness (which usually makes your immune system a lot less affective or put it into overdrive so your body starts fighting itself). Getting sick is gambling with your long term health. Please get vaccinated and wear masks (as it has been obvious that Covid especially has a high rate of Post Viral Syndrome, currently known as Long Covid) to protect yourself and those around you. Everyone feels invincible until it's too late, please don't take your working body for granted."
1,Your videos are always so high quality and entertaining! Also very informational. Thank you so much for making videos :D
1,"So the entire point of this video was to say, get vaccinated? I guess you can show this to anti vaxers but is that even worth it."

1,i do not have fevers anymore even when i get infected by stuff. kinda funky imo.

1,This is actually really scary and amazing.. every now and then I feel an existential crisis after watching a Kurzgesagt video
1,Im just here for the crazy Anti-Vaxxer comments.
0,meanwhile here i am killing myself with unhealthy sleep schedule
1,"I like the videos, but I feel as if we have had enough Immune system videos. Why not do something about politics or the economy?"
1,"Honey wake up, Kurzgesagt has uploaded another art piece"
2,Just a glorified ad for vaccines. Great. Just what we needed.
1,"Great video as always. 
I’d be interested in seeing a video about cytokine storms since it seems like a lot of deadly viruses cause that overreaction."
1,"This video seems highly bias - you act as if all vaccines are the same despite MRNA vaccines being far less effective than vaccines used for polio etc. You also don't bring up that you still likely get ill if you have one of these MRNA vaccines which means you'll get the damage anyway.

You also act like getting sick is rolling the dice with your life, despite in the vast majority of cases it is not... It comes across like you're using fear to push people to get vaccinated...

I'm a fan of this channel but this has obvious signs of bias where you're understating the effectiveness of natural immunity and purposely not disclosing information. The issue is if what you're saying is correct it comes across with low authenticity because of the way you've displayed it

Vaccines are safe and generally speaking we should all get vaccinated against disease - but you do yourself a disservice with this video"
1,"Holy crap, stop it with this npc propaganda believing nonsense.  Not all vaccines work or are safe. You want me to follow the science? Then stop feeding us profit and political driven half truths. Want me to believe that it does what you tell me? Then reform the approval process, release the safety data, the raw results of the data. The fda, cdc, nha, shouldn't believe a pharmaceutical compnay's word that its safe and effective. Besides the vaccine didn't do what we were told it would do. I can't believe your still pushing this misinformation even now after the truth is widely known."
1,So we all have a different kryptonite
1,I'll agree 100% with the vaccine/natural defense theory. No doubt about it. This Covid thing.. definitely an unnecessary vaccination (opinion. No sense in an argument) Very informative and great video! Thank you!
1,I'd like to think if there is one organisation that can be trusted it's Kurzgeszagt
1,"After getting 2nd covid vaccine i was in fever for week, and half a year after that my mind felt like in fog, and now i feel memory loses, lowered intelligency, bad movements of fingers (things are falling from my hands randomly) and much more. I am 31 but i feel like i aged by 30 years after that."

2,Neutraphils. Basically flametroopers with no care.
1,"Nice, now do one about the excess mortality that was NOT due to covid, that followed after the vaccine campaign.

Also, make sure to differentiate excess mortality by age groups, for example someone dying at 30 loses maybe 50 years of mostly productive and fulfilling life. While someone dying at 80 loses maybe a year of suffering.

1,"my wife's immune system should be studied by scientists. in 16 years, she's had a fever only once. never been hospitalized. she finds it weird that i get sick 1-2x a year. she had covid a week after i did last year but never again. she skipped her boosters while i got 2. i still got covid this year while she didn't even though i wasn't isolating. meanwhile, the 2 boosters gave me frozen shoulders. i can't lift my arms or reach my back without experiencing excruciating pain."

1,"You can train your immune system in other ways too: low level exercise, not to be owerweight (less calory intake if you are), mental balance, social connections incl. dog, cat, besides humans :). Just to have a cat will make your life longer statistically. Member of a family can add as much as a decade or more, so its a no joke. 10.000 steps/day is the best for your health, statistically you will not really gain more from more steps, but with less steps you will have a less healthy shorter life. Yes, thats a lot, so most of us need to adjust our ife around it. Like walk into work instead of car/transport. It is 100 minutes walk aproximatelly every day, but it can be the integral part of your day. I am sure I left some things out."

1,"Vaccines only work like they should if the companies that produce them are in it for helping people and not for making money. The covid vaccine, and covid in general, is a scam made by evil people to make money off people’s ignorance. I doubt i ever get a vaccine again. All hope in the vaccine institutions is gone. For many people."

1,Me change the color palte Them NOOOOO
1,Kinda funny this came out the day I got a 104F fever without any other sickness signs.
2,"Wow, this is the earliest I’ve been to you guys, great job your channel has gone so far !"
1,"This getting posted right as I get my seasonal cold is uncanny, but I appreciate it nonetheless"
1,still shilling the covid vaccine? lmfao
1,"You said ""vaccines pretend to be a disease"" which is true. However, the SARS-CoV-2 injection is not a traditional vaccine like how you depicted, but instead a gene therapy of sorts. It's as if you are trying to misrepresent the COVID vaccine as an easy choice, with decades of proven history just like other vaccines... 
Great info on the rest of the video. Let's stick to the facts and keep the adjenda-pushing in the garbage."
1,"No I wouldn’t say climate change is among the worst problems. Abortions is much worse. I’m not directly killing somebody by tossing something in the trash or driving my car, but abortion 100% of the time is directly kill somebody —> another vulnerable human being"
1,"It's a great video but I don't like the turn of the channel towards health. I always found the stars and space more interesting fascinating and unique, and also it's a repeatition of the (admirably awesome) book.  And I don't like  especially the vacation videos. I mean we all know the importance of vaccines, we get it,  no need to  sell it that much because it's starting to seem like propaganda."

0,This vaccine propaganda lol smh
1,"Vaccines are better than the immunity you get from natural infection? 
That’s not true. Especially with Covid."
1,Did you seriously just make a ten minute video advertising vaccines with that title?
2,"What doesn't kill you mutates, and tries again."
1,Why does my own immune system 3rd partyunamused_face
1,"On one hand antivaxxers are unlikely to be watching Kurzgesagt. 

On the other, it doesn't help to downplay and lie about the reality of biology in the hopes of _changing_ an antivaxxer either. Thats actually why they exist if I may venture a guess. Just look at the covid response here in the US; the authorities on the matter told what they thought were white lies to get people to do the right thing without scaring them, like when they said masks will protect you (they don't, they protect everyone else _from_ you). However, some people knew enough to know that what was being purported was BS, but not enough to know _why_ they were being BS'd. All that brewing distrust. Which was a breeding ground for political rhetoric like an open wound in the dirt is for bacteria.

So, rather than saying ""Vaccines ... [give you] no scars"" when compared to the big bad natural method of gaining immunity, perhaps just stick with the truth; vaccines are often like a boarder skirmish to avoid a full blown war. For all the reasons accurately described in the video here prior, it does cause collateral damage. Its just _way_ less than a full blown microbe-assault.

This doesn't seem like a case of simplification either, since the groundwork was already laid for the correct lesson. It simply smacks of an unnecessary statement, of going out of your way to say something not only disingenuous, but even contrary to the real science already laid out and leading that statement.

You can't fight lies and propaganda with lies and propaganda. Thats playing politics, not providing knowledge. But I digress."
1,"Great video! I love learning about the body and how it works. It’s a small detail, but I also like how you guys gave the protagonist character in this video a name: Martie!"

1,"Yeah that whole ""What doesn't kill you will make you stronger"" has always been a more philosophical thing. That Nietzsche world view of life is suffering but has a more mental aspect than physical one.

Of more concern to me is the shift of old Kurzgesagt to modern non-offensive Kurzgesagt. Old Kurzgesagt would present the pros, cons, and anything significant in between. Old Kurzgesagt would have gone over the different types of vaccines and if it was too much for one video they would give each one it's own short video."

1,"How to turn an interesting video about your immune response into an ad for your covid boosters...

Geez...  Given that it's been found the mRNA lingers in the body for more than 28 days after the injection when it was supposed to be gone after 2, that it doesn't protect you from getting it or transmitting it to others and that in the overwhelming majority of cases, vax or no vax, you get mild flu-like symptoms, I see no point in getting vaccinated for that specific virus.  Most likely I've already developed natural immunity  - which is better than the vaccine as studies have shown - from asymptomatic exposure."

1,"You should really specify how the SARS vaccine does not work like the ones described in this video.  A little disingenuous at best, since increasing vaccine use and confidence is clearly the goal of this video."

1,"at , I am curious to see if individuals really do need to make changes or if it is more so a problem with specific countries and businesses? I guess at the end of the day, if individuals care about carbon footprint, governments and businesses will too since they are made up of people"
1,"I get that you don't want to touch on the hot button subject of the corona ""vaccine"" (in quotes due to CDC redefinition language games). I think that is a mistake.
You are trying to reduce vaccine hesitancy through understanding, but that well was poisoned when major institutions during the pandemic actively suppressed and censored (see twitter files) nuanced engagement in favour of a simplistic (false) ""safe and effective"" narrative.
Until the missteps during the pandemic have been  thoroughly addressed, any such endeavour is hopefully mute.
I say hopefully because there is a need for ""Vergangenheitsbewältigung"" here. And in this context I think your video is tone death.
Even the authoritarian health minister of germany Karl Lauterbach, has recently commented on wanting to help the people with ""Post-Vac-Syndrom"". FYI those are people that have been severely damaged by vaccine side effects. I'm talking swelling of the brain, severe heart issues and inability to walk (see a recent documentary by ZDFheute, a german mainstream media source: watch?v=TRbnyY00R_0).

I think you have good intentions but the wheel is still in spin and maybe you should not have spoken too soon without addressing the elephant in the room."
1,"Auto immune diseases are one of the worst things ever. In a way it's like cancer with it's rebellious nature that continues to wage war on good cells almost like a bad government and civil war. On top of this our microbiomes are also changing and I have a feeling it'll only get worse. Imagine those microbiomes like an arsenal of weapons they can use for the situation and a passive defense system. The more variety the better the tools for any situation. Should we lose them it'll just be a desperate ""Whatever it takes"" response as if it were a japanese kamikaze using way too much explosives to kill a single flu cell."

1,"When a vaccine had side effects (particularly the 2nd covid vaccine in my case), I was thinking: awesome. This means my immune system is responding and things are actually working. Feeling 100% better the next was expected, since a vaccine is a weakened/less potent version. So yeah, that only confirmed to me that it was working."
1,why do you work for Bill Gates
1,Hiv can defeat the immune system it can’t be that deadly if it can’t even fight a virus that goes literally right towards them.

1,I m tired of these cells doing what they want
1,"Around the ""how to train your immune system"" is something that a lot of the people I associate with needed to understand during the early days of [redacted disease] I'm no biologist but it felt like almost no one I talked to paid attention to bio class. I've had a few people I know, young and old, die from it. And they still would question what's the importance of vaccines and the immune response. I've had it, and I felt like death for almost a month. My folks (nearing their 70's) got it and were mild to no real symptoms barring lack of smell and taste for the better part of a week. The immune system is great at what it does, but some people are really ""built different"".

Tested through out the week for covid and always negative.  Whatever I had I wasn't 100% feeling for sure, but it was never enough to knock me out of my normal schedule or routine.  My Germaphobia felt pretty insulted that I'd potentially have caught a common cold over something like covid. Watching this though guess it's just when it comes to covid and a common cold I'm higher on the scale now?  That said when I got a cold prior to the pandemic I'd be knocked out of commission and have a high fever. It would also be at least 3 days before recovering to being functional."
1,I feel like this is the closest Kurzesagt is going to come to acknowledge the war in ukraine
1,"I'm Maltese, Irish and french, which covers a very wide genetic base and have only caught Chickenpox due to a tetnis shot lowering my immune system, but at 28, kicked it in just 3 days. that's the only time i've been sick. i also have a very highly active metabolism."
1, get out of my head
2,I love you guys!!!! Thank you for all you do for these videos!!!
2,"ok, now you got my attention"
1,"All good and we'll if the vaccine actually functions as intended. Most do, more like 99 percent. But the damage done by the covid vaccine and its lack of effectivity and the damage it has done to certain individuals cannot be overlooked lightly."
1,Don't think of pathogenic bacteria as invaders. They are just hard-working cells looking for an opportunity to make a better life for themselves and they're progeny.
1,Yes new video
1,I'm planning on creating a game about the immune system.
1,"Can you all do one of these immune system videos in terms of type one diabetes, an immune disease. I would love to see the differences and compare"
1,Highly unethical to mix interesting facts with technocratic dreams. One more video promoting top-down control by experts and I’m unsubbing.
1,The animation is god tier but the music and sound effects are criminally underrated. Massive appreciation to all the team effort.
1,This literally teaches me more than 3 months of school.
1,Could you do a video explaining what appears to be a fallacy where vaccines are supposed to make you not only invincible to a specific disease but also make it impossible for you to transmit that disease as a carrier?
1,"I thought you were gonna to talk about an autoimmune disease, that was good anyway."
1,"As a doctor, I'm constantly amazed at the accuracy and detail of your videos, KUDOS."
1,I’m 13 and it took my immune system 3 days to fight off Covid how is some people spending weeks having it skull

1,Sponsored by big pharma?
1,"As a gamer, I like to think that the ""nature dojo"" is comparable to playing on Permadeath."
1,"I trust vaccines, but only those who already have enough research and enough time for animal trials and enough human trials before they are injected into my body.
For example, If you give me a vaccine but you can't tell me how high the chance I will get myocarditis or even dead after vaccination, I have no idea how can I trust that."
1,"You can still workout while sick, you just have to keep yourself to a medium, because too much exercise will compromise your body, no duh, and too little can leave you really weak."
1,"whenever someone tells me ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"" I say ""So if I break your arm, but I dont kill you, you're stronger?"""
1,"Not true, vaccines are not permanent and needs to be reapplied every 3-4 years while getting covid will give u a permanent immune response"
1,"Another certified banger, how do you keep up this pace?"
1,CDC says natural immunity is superior to jab relating to covid ….lots of this is opinion
1,"I have a lot of health problems because of my inmune system going haywire, this video is very interesting."
2,Now that's a better arguement.
1,Can u record something about space? Please bro
1,"They really put covid in the same group as the black Death, Ebola, and HIV.

Do the people making this really think it's comparable?"
1,Can't believe they did an 8 minute setup to shove the vaccine agenda down our throats...

0,Interesting how depression and the immune response are so similar
1,right after i got done reading immune? perfect timing!
1,"Vaccines have decades of proven efficacy and have completely eliminated some very nasty diseases in entire countries.
Vaccines are AWESOME.

I really wish the meaning of the word ""vaccine"" hadn't been changed slightly to include that new mRNA treatment.
It's really giving vaccines a bad name."
1,"Ohhh I understand the flak kurzgesasgt is getting. They are explaining how vaccines are good and work, not claiming they cause 5g mind control coronavirus' face_with_tears_of_joy"
1,"i like the video! its very informative but dang, lowkey sad cuz i thought its a video on behavioral changes or diet changes to increase immune system, was not expecting its about vaccines.. (edit: now my comment sounds out of context..the original title of the video was"" Best way to boost your immune system (with science!) so i thought it was a self-help advice"")"
1,Now I can make RON synonymous with my body and understand my body well...
1,"Another great video, thanks for your research and for sharing!! I would say that, even as a 21 year old, I'm weaker on the immunity spectrum. But now that I know that I can build muscle to provide myself greater defenses, I may start focusing on that bulk!! Is there anything else we can do (Is drinking more water actually beneficial, vitamin intake, etc.)?"
2,Such great quality videos!
1,Vaccines are fun and good until you use MRNA vaccines which has never been used and we don't know their long term effects and the RNA goes into your blood stream and finds its way into your heart cells and tells them to produce virus spikes and then your immune system attacks your heart and you end up with permenant scars on your heart which you would never get if you've just gotten sick !
2,Thank you for bringing light and hope to the cesspool of ignorance and misinformation.

1,"This is alle easy for me since i became a dad, my toddler brings all sorts of aggressive end-boss virussen and bacteria from daycare! Every week we tremble if my boy gets somewhat soft stool or start coughing slightly to deep because you never know if this turns out into a 12hour aggressive vomiting session or 3weeks of coughing up glue thick slime while being out of breath! Getting 3 types of stomach flu once every month that i didn't know was possible. ha ha"

1,"How to beat a person who is stronger than you, sneeze at them"
1,"Yo, my fellow nerds! Can you imagine if Kurzgesagt dropped an animated series that's all about LitRPGs? It would be so lit, we'd need to wear sunglasses just to watch it! I'm talking epic graphics, intense battles, and characters leveling up like bosses! And forget about generic fantasy worlds, how about we see our immune system going ham on viruses and germs? That's the kind of protagonist we need, a badass immune system with attitude! So, let's hope Kurzgesagt hears our prayers and drops this dope series!"

1,"I would add in this video that this only applies to vaccines that have gone through the proper procedures. Rushed vaccines that ignore warning signs and are rushed into production can do more harm than good. As always, haste makes waste."

1,did anyone here the arrgh sound effect
1,"I feel like your vaccine analogy is flawed, I mean its pretty arrogant of humans to think we can do a better job of protecting our self's via vaccines and medicine etc than nature has been doing for millions of years. Put another way, 100's of millions of years of trail and error (Nature) is surely better than 100 years of human research? Don't get me wrong I'm all for vaccines but i don't think its a better solution than our already established very powerful existing immune system (more like a helper)."

1,"So as I watched this, I’m dealing with Covid (just my luck; I caught it a day before I could get the new vaccine). But I’ve got the new antiviral drugs, and I’m going to get the vaccine jab as soon as I can. I want diseases to see me coming and all run screaming the other way."
1,"Should we talk about autoimmune diseases? Like sometime our immune system has a problem that it attacks our own body and may lead to some diseases such as diabetes type 1, basedow, rheumatoid arthritis or even worst anaphylaxis. I think this topic also related to immune system and people could understand more details why our immune system is dangerous, too."

1,"The book Spillover by David Quammen is a super interesting book about diseases and viruses, a bit terrifying tho ngl."
1,"Very nice buildup to offering vaccines as a solution, actually. The video is really good at capturing interest in someone , so it may sway those who still nonsensically believe vaccines are not worth using."
1,"Your videos are insanely filled with knowledge

I hope everyone watch and understand how our body and immunity works and how vaccine can be helpful instead of believing pseudoscience and anti vaccine propaganda"
1,"Getting sick is a part of the ordinary experience of being human, the notion that you can completely avoid all illness is ridiculous. Yes get vaccinated, but you're going to get sick. And most importantly take care of yourself, 80% of covid deaths in USA were ppl that were obese. 95% of covid deaths were people that were older than 65 or obese. Healthy people generally did not die from covid"

1,"Question: Isn't the body getting warming one of the reactions the body does to kill viruses (virii?) thus, it does require energy, but it's one of the many things the body does, like the immune system, to kill the invasion? Are you saying the heat is just a byproduct of the immune system working extra hard?

Edit: If it's just a byproduct, then it should be good to cool down your body when sick, rather than laying undercover in bed."

0,My tummy hurts :(
0,Wilhelm scream haunts me everywhere i go
1,Nice pro vax propoganda nudge in the end (not antivax myself )so people keep Bill gates' business running
1,Does anyone remember the old thumbnail and title of this video?
1,Very interesting and informative video - but I can't help thinking what a shame it is that we're *still* having to produce pro-vax propaganda because there are people who think vaccines are bad/harmful.
1,I see the anti-vax dipshits are flooding the comments. Very nice.
1,What about the specific adverse affects that mRNA vaccines like the covid vacc
1,"Everyone, get your annual flu shot!"
1,Did anyone else notice that the title to the video changed? Or just me?
1,Another thing to consider when it comes to boosting your immune system: _sleep more_ . Sleep deprivation induces a state of immunodeficiency because your body restocks its circulating immune cells while you sleep.
1,"Friendly reminder that carbon capture isn't a thing and will never help prevent climate change. They want you to think this so the can burn more coal and fossil fuels and they'll just ""capture it later"""
1,"Question on vaccine being better than natural immunity stated at . Your sources talk about vaccine adjuncts and vaccines containing specific parts of a virus that will help your immune system fight it. But isn’t this specific protein model the issue with the effectiveness of the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine? I’m under the understanding with omicron variant the spike protein mutated leaving the vaccine far less effective? Wouldn’t a body’s natural process of creating antibodies to several proteins create the most robust defense?  Aside from this disagreement and hopeful explanation, I love this channels work! keep the videos coming."

1,Hey. Has the quality dropped? I’ve enjoyed seeing the illustrators work develop and improve over time. Not sure about this.
1,I've been waiting for this
1,"Back in 2021, before I could get vaccinated, I contracted the Delta variant of Covid and unfortunately gave it to my husband as well. At the time he was living with advanced COPD but, unlike me, he had been vaccinated. I am 12 years younger than him (I was 52 at the time) and in relative good health but I was almost killed by Covid which gave me ""cavitating pneumonia"" that ate huge holes in my lungs (some as big as eggs), causing me to cough up so much blood I needed 2 blood transfusions. Whereas my husband, who should have been far sicker than me, managed to fight off his infection while at home. But I had to spend 2 months in hospital and have been dealing with Long Covid symptoms ever since. I recently had more CT scans and xrays and now my lungs look like Swiss cheese. They will never heal and just this past week, I was diagnosed with COPD like my husband. I've since had my vaccines and boosters and have not gotten sick from Covid again. So for those of you who still flip-flop on the benefits of getting vaccinated, do yourself a favour and smarten up. The vaccines are the only thing stopping humanity from witnessing many more millions of deaths from mutating Covid strains. Thus far the WHO estimates that the Covid vaccines have prevented over 19 million more deaths. As far as I'm concerned, this is case closed."

1,How much did gates pay you for this one?
1,"First off, amazing video once again.

What can we do to improve our immune system outside flu shots? I find it a bit odd that nothing else other than flu shots have been mentioned. I do get my shots whenever possible, but there is some literature showing that adequate sleep and exercise can improve immune system as well.

Maybe there isn't enough evidence for that? If so, I think it should be mentioned.

Say for example, we have a mixed group of people separated into 2 separate groups who both take their flu and vaccine shots. One group (A) has adequate sleep and exercises while the other group (B) has poor sleep and no exercise. Which group will have a better immune system?"

1,"The only video Kurzgesagt that didn’t feel politically neutral to me

I’m very much against “Anti-Vaxxers” and don’t mind vaccines 

Just wish the video didn’t feel like Political propaganda for certain sides

I expect Kurzegsagt videos to be objective and have a broader outlook
Hope it’s not a theme that continues."
1,"Love the channel! Here i have a serious question though. The claim is ""Vaccine dojo is better than nature dojo..... The immunity you get from a vaccine is often better than the natural"" 
How is this proved? This claim is a bit hollow and i would love to have something that explains why this is true (if true). And since you are using the war for a basis of comparison, you can say that a soldier trained in camp is better prepared for war than a soldier that was trained on the battlefield. This will never be true!"
1,Honestly pretty sad about this video. “Often vaccine derived immunity is superior to natural immunity” I would like to see some evidence for that. Vaccines only work because they trigger the same immune response that natural infections do.
1,One of few channels to have every video cross over a million views
1,Closely following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and educating myself on difficulties of waging war prepared me for this onslaught of militaristic analogies describing the immune system.

0,This is really informative. Gets to the core of why getting sick is always bad.
2,"So I guess collagen, vitamin C, and vitamin D help? Pre-pro biotic as well"
1,"Interesting how you talked about natural and vaccine introduced diseases. I'm vaccinated and boosted for covid, but haven't bothered since Jan of 2022 as the Omicron variant changes so quickly. Why take shots based on year old variants? I've taken two antibody tests in the past year and both have shown me positive and very high in antibodies. So I have been exposed to the virus naturally. It's amazing watching my body handle everything. I've also never shown any symptoms whatsoever, except some mild fatigue and very slight fever after being vaccinated."
1,"There is only one God. “Within the one Being that is God, there exists eternally three coequal and coeternal persons, namely, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.” God is the creator of everything and is Sovereign over everything. God has appointed his only Son to judge the living and the dead. We have all sinned and broken God’s law, such as abortion, lying, stealing, lusting, anger, pride, etc. God is Holy and Just. That is why when God judges he cannot let even one sin from anyone go unpunished and that punishment is eternal hell. We can’t work our way into heaven and our good deeds can’t save us from our sin. The bible says all our righteous acts are like filthy rags. We would perish if we died and faced God with our own righteousness.


The Good news is that God is also Love and Merciful and sent his only Son to save his people from their sin. Jesus who is fully God and fully human, lived a perfect life and never sinned. He willingly went to the cross where the Father took the wrath that was meant for his people and put it on Jesus. Jesus paid the price for their sin and died on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised him from the dead. God commands all people everywhere to repent of their sins and to put their trust in Jesus. Biblical repentance is a change of mind about Sin. It’s an attitude of the heart, genuinely turning from sin to God. Everyone who repents and puts their trust in Jesus, will have their sins credited to Jesus, and Jesus’s righteousness will be credited to them. Their sins will be forgiven, and they will be given eternal life. When it’s time to face God, he will welcome them into heaven because of Jesus’s perfect righteousness."

1,man I was hoping for tips to boost immune system in general. Like you can't just get vaccines for everything
1,Sounds like Mr. Bill Gates is financing the videos. I don't trust this narrative completely.
1,The consistency that Kurzgesagt just showed isn't a joke considering the amount they put behind each of their videos!
1,vaccines are NOT better defense than natural immunity.....
1,Why does this episode feel like I'm being propagandized to about covid and my inherent sin of carbon emission?
1,"This video is brought to you by Pfizer, the same people who paid for the definition of 'vaccine' to be changed."
1,"Covid mrna vaccine stays in body more than 28 days, i don't believe it's safe and effective until proven otherwise.

And your content are more disguised messages from certain party, it is time to say goodbye, thanks for everything."
1,"Beat hemorrhagic fever and West Nile both without symptoms. Only found out because the whole group both times got tested. I got the vaccines for COVID. In fact, the only vaccine I'd hard pass on again was anthrax. It should be a choice, but your answer should be yes. Vaccines are fantastic, though that's not saying they're always perfect (occasionally they are withdrawn, e.g. Lyme disease) make the right choice based on your own research because beating people down never results in them agreeing with you. I like to tell people the above to help them make a good choice."
1,"I love your videos, but you seem to have taken a turn towards sharing opinions and calling them facts. It’s sad to watch a great channel begin it demise."
1,Video ideas: How allergies work?
1,"Nah. I'm just not gonna get it. If it can't confirm it disprove a hypothesis, aka make a prediction, it ain't science. Medicine is applied science if you squint hard enough, maybe. So, no thanks"

1,"I believe it's in their book that infections/diseases can kill you in days/months/years, but your immune system can kill you in seconds. It's a military you want used just enough to stop the invasion, and no more. Get your vaccines, it's worth it!"
1,Damn lot of comments in a few mins
1,"Great video, however you could have been more cautious with integrating COVID vaccines (mostly mRNA) with all the information surrounding them that is still unclear."
1,"Holy crap. I love this channel. Yet there were a couple very FALSE statement's in here. crying_face natural immunity is WAY better than vaccine immunity. It's a small detail, but when you reach millions of of people, it's dangerous. Like saying ""that's why young people died of covid."" Those were not healthy young adults as stated. Zero completely healthy people died of covid. Same as ZERO completely healthy people die of the flu or another corona virus, the common cold. I'm studying in my doctorate, doing virology studies atm, and these statement's need to be corrected. Very dangerous to only state one side of a story, and is sad to see such a great channel take one side of an obviously political stance. Get VAXXED. If you are at risk. Otherwise you are doing yourself a disservice, and making a pharmaceutical company rich."
1,The new vaccines for covid don't work this way. They skip the training phase and supposedly they use the body to manufacture the finished product at once. Only the Johnson worked as the video describes.

So instead of naturally training our immune system to defend against something..we genetically engineer a product designed to fight the disease directly..thus forever putting you at the whimsy and will of a pharmaceutical company to produce products that effectively replace your immune system. You become dependent on commercially produced products for your survival.
2,Many thanks for the helpful information you've provided.
1,It is quite sad that so many still thinks vaccines are bad for someone and they give reasons that are not even scientifically or medically supported.

1,"How do you know that we can combat climate change? What if the climate changes naturally, like it’s cyclical? There is absolutely no way to know that humans are the cause of climate change figuring the climate has only been recorded for 1-200 years, out of the millions since the earth was created."
1,OMG You have so many subs
1,"@  ""This is why seemingly very healthy young people died from Covid while for some elderly people, it was more like a mild flu.""  If you check the CDCs website of provisional counts (COVID-19 Death Data and Resources) the data say otherwise. This video isn't wrong about the proven vaccines that DO work but WTF Kurzgesagt!? This video full is a Pharmaceutical shill piece. Didn't even mention all the other ways you can boost your immune system, like diet and exercise."
1,They literally clickbated people into being pro vaxination. I love this channel

0,What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.. except when you have a serious illness like aids
1,I'm surprised this didn't talk more about acquired autoimmune diseases.  One of the nastiest things a virus can do to you is train your body to kill itself in some way or another.
1,"Vaccines used to be a great thing.
With covid came the mRNA rushed and forced vaccines which made the word dirty.
They also changed the meaning of vaccine to include the dangerous covid intervention as an vaccine.

Bring back the real definition of vaccines and never let the government force a rushed experimental therapy on society, only properly studied ones with consent."
1,"To yall who fail against nature dojo:

Skill issue"
1,"In the ""training"" part you should've mentioned a generally healthy life style as well. Vaccines are all fine and dandy but rely on us knowing what's comming our way. Working out, not smoking, not being obese, ect. all the things that contribute to a healthier body are catch all's aside from their various other benefits and should definitely be covered when you have a dedicated part about increasing the immune systems efficiency."

1,"Just figured I'd speak this into the aether: it's not far-fetched to say that many, if not most,  anti-vaccine folks and their kids have survived because of vaccines taken by the rest of the population. (as many deadly diseases have either been wiped out or forced to evolve into repeatedly less threatening strains).  Even when opposing vaccines they will still benefit you, the life-saving support that vaccines provide is inescapable."

1,"i guess we will never know if avoiding the dojo all together will be the only option, and when this could be possible"
1,"Yeah and no. You can't just inject yourself with the vaccine and call it a day. Real immune boosting involves proper nutrition and regular exercise, which throughout the pandemic have not been emphasized or shilled like vaccines were, because there's no money to be made from it. If anything, activity was strongly discouraged, resulting in already healthy people becoming less healthy/immunocompromised."

1,"Was this video retitled? I swear an hour ago it was something like ""How to boost your immune system"""
1,"Can you do a video on scar tissue? It damages organs, prevents hair and skin from regenerating, blinds us, is a shitty replacement for cartilage. As we age we just keep getting more of it and we increasingly function less well unlike creatures that simply don't create scar tissue, or at least replace it with useful tissue after the injury. There must be research to make our bodies break it down so the healing can start?"
1,How's that propoganda money treating you?
1,"Ugh... that is so disappointing.  I expected Kurzgesagt of all places to properly not refer to the liver as a filter.  The liver does not filter anything... it metabolizes things.  That is its job.  Kidneys filter.  It has been used as this generic statement for so long, but it isn't even true.  Metabolizing is not filtering, it is converting something to a more usable form... sometimes it takes multiple steps, like ethanol (alcohol).  The intermediary forms can even be worse for our bodies... like ethanol (worse than ethanol until it is turned into an acid, basically vinegar, or into a ketone)  and methanol (lethal)."

1,How much did big pharma pay you to make this video? Read the book turtles all the way down.
1,"Covid is a real world example of this for me. I caught that leaked biological weapon almost three years ago. Was only sick for two days, very mildly as well - a slight ache in the back and a stuffy nose, but that was all. By the third day I was right as rain, except for my taste and smell which had completely disappeared. 

For just over one month I couldn't taste or smell a thing. It started to get annoying, even worrying, but one afternoon I was cooking a roast and suddenly I smelled onions eminating from the kitchen. Super excited, I ran to the oven and opened it up. ""Aaaaah .... onion rings!"". I sat on the kitchen floor, stuffing half cooked onion rings into my mouth faster than I could chew, when I noticed my kids were staring at me in horror from the doorway. I replaced their onion rings with new ones and returned them to oven.

However, regarding what doesn't kill you - doesn't always make you stronger, barely a month after my smell returned, something happened to it. I developed Parosmia - which is a distortion of taste and smell. The nerve connections in my upper sinus, the olifactory system, which communicates what type of particles (tastes and flavours) we are consuming to our brains, got torn assunder. All that time I thought I'd beaten covid in just two days, was wrong. The virus was obviously destroying those nerve clusters, and one fateful day - every food I'd ever loved smelled of burned chemicals and rotting flesh. My favourite curry, a freshly cooked plate of vegetables, a cup of coffee, even sweets - you name it, it was now disgusting. The only things that I could stomach were plain bread or pasta, water and cheese.

It's been almost 3 years, and things are still all warped. There is no fix. Those cells were never meant to be damaged, and so cannot mend themsleves or grow back. Covid, that escaped biological weapon, took my currys away forever. Sure, I'm getting used to it now, but accepting that I'm eating this watermelon that tastes like rotting flesh, doesn't mean I'm fixed. It just means I'm resigned."

nah man just a normal...
[struggles trying to pronounce kurzgesagt] agh,
Just a normal ""In a nutshell"" video"
1,Would be cool if we could get a covid vaccine
1,I am not against vaccines and I am vaccinated against all the important things including covid but I still feel like you are shilling vaccines way too much here. I understand it is a careful balance to not give opponents of vaccine too much of a foot to stand on by pointing out drawbacks but in my opinion this is way too close to a late-night shopping channel to be worthy of this channel.
1,"Dude... I know you generally try to be objective and unbiased and all, but if you wanted to mention vaccines, you really should've talked about smallpox vaccine instead of the Covid ones. You know, the shit that's true, tried, works ALL the time and would make a great example of a vaccine eradicating a disease. This video feels like you are very involved in the matter and have an obvious agenda that you're trying to preach, not like you're talking about the usual science stuff from the observer standpoint.

Also instead of talking about vaccines for 5 minutes, you should've mentioned autoimmune disorders, since it's literally what the title is about. I really hope this video is a one-off thing that you got paid for :/"
1," “We use that for training children, and for propping the door open when its hot.”"

1,The analogy should be called RISK of Infection
1,"Unfortunately, this video fails to tell you that many covid vaccines aren't traditional vaccines, and thus either don't work or have very bad side effects.

Traditional vaccines such as the ones for polio are safe. But MRNA vaccines are unproven and should only be taken if your body is already compromised."
1,"cool so I'll just get a vaccine when I have cancer. or when I have depression. or when I have a cold. I don't wanna know how many people watch this video without realizing that the title's claim is complete nonsense. thanks a lot ""science-channel""."

1,Your Immune System is More Dangerous than You Think is brought to you by Pfizer
1,"Thats all well and good, but when the ""Vaccine dojo"" was poorly designed in a rush by people who care exclusively about money, it can be nearly as dangerous as ""Nature dojo"", and cause both permanent damage or death - even if its less likely than with the Nature Dojo; which you might have been able to just avoid. A blunt training sword, can still crack your head open, even if it can't cut.
Vaccines are great, but don't presume anything with that label on it is automatically liquid gold and can do no harm. Spreading that kind of uncritical thinking is dangerous. In some cases/individual it can be worse than the alternative as the covid clown show - and following proof of better treatments and information having been suppressed, should have proved."
1,Vaccines are the g.o.a.t
1,Whoever said natural immunity can’t be trusted needs to quit listening to the media and fucking Pfizer and all the Dr.  Fauci’s of the world
1,"I feel like vaccines are the most misunderstood thing in modern medicine. 

You tell someone that you need to cut their head open while they're awake and operate on their brain, they have no issue with it.

The same doctor is now trying to administer a shot to your precious child and because you heard a Facebook mom list possible side effects, you'd rather endanger the entire public instead of educate yourself.

The fact there's even a discussion whether or not the risk outweighs the reward just shows  people are too far removed from watching loved ones die from curable ailments. This proving the damn things necessary in the first place"

1,Anyone notice the monkey holding a virus in the intro?
0,Wren is a huge scam. Sad to see this channel turn to garbage promoting scams and fake vaccine ideology.
1,"I really think they missed a big problem.  Due to not understanding how some diseases work, or due to poor manufacturing problem attempts to create vaccines people have been severely hurt or diseases have actually spread.  Overall vaccines that have had extensive testing and deemed safe are far less likely to cause issues.  As we've recently seen with the covid vaccines there are many side effects that weren't known or disclosed to the public before vaccination.  Other attempts at using live but weakened viruses have led to outbreaks of the very disease  they were administered to prevent.

Vaccines have been great at reducing modern diseases but they're not a silver bullet.  Depending on the severity of the disease and risk to patients and risk of disease it may be preferable to simply contract the disease.  Also the bit about a stronger immune response is highly dependent on the type of vaccine used.  The current covid vaccines using mrna technology only prompts vaccines against the spike protein which has been shown to be less effective than natural immunity especially as the virus mutates quickly and the shape of the spike used changes."

You should have steered clear of Covid during this whole video, though an exception can be made about how individuals react differently to said virus.
I'll share some life changing infomation, please feel free background check each bit of advice to learn even more about it yourself, because I know when you do, you'll understand even more for why these are so beneficial for our human bodies.
1.Eating healthy = not being too skinny or overweight
2. 30 minutes of light cardio EVERY DAY
3. GOOD SLEEP! A consistant and sound sleeping routine is highly effective in recovery from each day and giving our body the chance to rest
4. Cold showers (increase white blood cell production and efficiency, Hot saunas (Shock proteins)
5. Weightlifting! You don't need to be no Brian Shaw! (creating new capillaries creates new routes for our blood to travel, making it even more effective for treating injuries or fighting off foreign bacteria IE a virus by being able to send X antibodies through the more routes you have created from weightlifting)
6. Breathing meditations, it is EXERCISE FOR OUR Diaphram the muscle that contracts our lungs!
These 6 tips will increase your likelihood of staying fit and healthy."

1,"Could you cover how Vaccines can also not be the perfect defense. For instance my cousin and many other people I know have gotten heart inflammation from the Pfizer vaccine. Since they signed a waiver before taking the drug, they can't even sue for chronic issues or symptoms. From how I understand it, the vaccine trained cells to produce longer strands of fibrous proteins and this acts like cholesterol in the blood stream making it more viscous and results in heart inflammation. He uses blood thinners or drinks a lot of water to suppress these affects."
1,"Actually, nature is a very healthy way to improve our immune system, because humans have evolved in nature and have learned to train their immune system in nature. It doesn't make us weaker with the ""scars"", because the body also knows how to train itself to avoid them."
1,So basically go to a doctor when sick instead of treating your body yourself at home with natural remedies.

I mean I'm sure they got enough threats ""from the man"" that forced them to come up with a video that say you need vaccines. I mean this Channel's other video on immune system was amazing and they basically stated that your body can create endless amounts of different kinds of weapons to fight against diseases they were saying how complex the human immune system is and how amazing it is and basically we manufacture all sorts of tools to fight all sorts of illnesses in the universe. Now we're back peddling and saying no this is not true what doesn't kill you makes you weaker and only way to help yourself is to get a f*cking vaccine. Wow they really got you guys."

1,its kinda sus to simplify one of the most complicated and least understood things about our body like that but okay
1,kinda sucks how he didn’t get into the protein aspect of it. Seems like low protein diets should have weaker immune system. To top it all it means the entire immune system is run on proteins. Felt like that was a detail that is quite important just like you don’t eat carbohydrates to increase muscle mass. Eating protein= immune system would be kinda groundbreaking what does that mean for our overall health ? So many question with no answers !!

1,"What if I want to get vaccinated, but already have autism, do I get autism^2 or can I pick a replacement based on preference?"
1,Lul this channel became billionaire propaganda shit((( vaccine and climate change )))
1,"Funny how the sponsor is an application that “helps reduce your carbon footprint”. I thought that in one of their climate change videos, kurzgesagt admitted that the carbon footprint idea was primarily made by BP in order to shift the blame from the company to the consumers."
1,Pfizer sponsor this video? What a joke
1,"The explanation about workings of the immune system was great, but... Really? All of a sudden you turn to endorsing propaganda? What next? You will make a video explaining how good it was when people had the paper tickets for the food they can buy?"
1,"after such add of bs, do a dive into carbon capture and why they are schemes that does not work"
1,i found rule 34 with your charecters
1,can you do more videos with blowing things up please folded_hands
2,Thanks for the video :)
1,Already baked and ready for this one
1,I repeat it again: I would love a videogame with the Kurzgesagt art in it about a real time strategic fight of immune cells vs virus/bacteria/prions/fungi/parasites/etc. Imagine a field with thousands of immune cells vs hundreds of thousands of invaders microbe
1,Pefect!  We needed this 3 years ago to slap antivaxrs with though.
2,I just pray to Baphomet.
1,"I got a body that is very sensitive to bacteria/infections. Even a mild sore throat will skyrocket my body temperature to 40+ Celsius. 
Like dude chill out it's just a sore throat that will be gone in a day or two."
1,so thats why scars don'tt grow hair thanks
1,"""Imagine crazy, aggressive chimps with machine guns.""
That sounds so cool..."
1,Why does the body consume muscle over fat for quick energy?
1,"I'm all for traditional vaccines, and am well aware of how complex the immune system is, I even bought your book explaining just that. But how can you lump the covid mRNA Pfizer and Moderna ""vaccine"" in the same category as those that actually did what they were supposed to do and didn't come with the risk of side effects WAY WAY worse than the disease itself? Of all people you ought to know we as a species do not yet fully understand the complexity of the immune system enough to go mucking around with it to the degree these mRNA do. I respect your intellect and value your opinion so I genuinely would like to know."
1,This background music is _banging!_
1,Now imagine your body fighting against himself. Now that's a auto-immune disorder. Add to that a basic cold. I can say for sure it feels way worse than regular people have it.
1,What Kurzgesagt does is amazing! Animation on another level.........
2,Covid vaccine is dangerous lol don’t care what anyone says
1, I've never would have expected a Society Clown meme in Kurzgesagt's channel.
1,Kurzgesagt is really good at making videos about the immune system. If a college asked kurzgesagt to make videos for a course for them or recommend students read their immune system book I would not be surprised.
1,Google is spying on me… HOW DOES IT KNOW I AM SICK
1,"You're immune system is a jerk
A truth for alot of people.

But the quote made me giggle!"
1,Congrats on #7 on trending!
1,This video was sponsored by Pfizer.
1,Turns into jab propaganda 2/3rd through
1,"Further reason not to discount things as ""It'll only kill disabled ppl UwU"" cause not only is it ableist asf and lines into eugenics, but because biodiversity keeps the whole species alive"
1,"Yeah after the past 3 years, my trust in medical science is at an all time low. Just put ""brought to you by pfizer"" at the front of the video and id have mlre respect for you."
1,"This is one of those videos that the people who really need to see it won't watch it or won't believe it if they do. People who say that all they need is their immune system, or worse yet, people who think ""boosting"" it is a desirable goal. Your immune response can be your worst enemy in certain cases. The inflammation it causes can be more damaging than the pathogen. Vaccination helps your body to clear any infection you might get, or keep you from getting sick altogether. As stated in the video, the natural way is not always the best way to go but it is the riskiest. ""My immune system is really strong"" is not as positive as people think. Covid is a trigger. It's your immune response that kills you."
1,I catch almost always the cold thus when I'm healthy again it passes through me really fast. I'm not immune to it yet I still have less day-offs during schooltime because of it
2,"These immune videos are my favourites, super interesting engaging series, the book too! Always love to see a new upload"
2, gotta love the better call Saul reference
1,"Thank you for making this video. Too much of the special grade stupid by the anti-vaxx community comes from that whole imbecilic idea that ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"". I met elderly relatives at family reunions when I was really young who lived before the polio vaccine. That disease permanently maimed those misfortunate enough to survive it. Yes, vaccines have side effects. Some vaccine side effects are common and some are one in a million terrible, but the risk is justifiable because the disease the vaccine is designed to combat has far worse aftereffects. Sometimes, what doesn't kill you weakens you and sets you up for more suffering and even death with the next disease in line. Just to use an old ""Dragon Ball"" example, few of us immune system wise are Goku and win the martial arts tournament, most of us are Yamcha."
1,"Wait, what happened with regards to immunization around the year 2000?"
1,I may have a very strong response because when I have a fever it's always a high fever. It doesn't last very long too
1,"It's awfully kind of you all trying to reach out to the antivax group but I think that's part of natural selection. They don't want to utilize science especially with proven results, then they will be weeded out of the human gene pool."
1,Made me excited to get my first ever flu shot
1,The man who speaks has the best voice of brittain i’ve ever heard! So smooth!!!grinning_face_with_sweat
1,This channel has been improving their animation with every video
1,"This is what the rightwing side of youtube calls propaganda. 
I'd be stunned except the same people call praguerU an university."
1,"Cell:*sitting there*
Bacteria:*nibbles cell*
Cell:Peh X_X 
Immune cells: say goodnight 
Bacteria:F*CK SH*T IM GONNA DIE"
1,smiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyescan you upload a video about the moon or eye or ear please if you can smiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyesThank you smiling_face_with_smiling_eyesbagel
1,"Interesting that all of a sudden their is more and more anti immune system videos , huhshushing_face"
1,Who called it fever and not fewar
1,Don’t get me wrong I’m 100% pro vaccine but this felt more like propaganda than an informational video
1,"What happened to influenza through COVID doe, where’d they go?"
1,Wait weren’t it old people who were more prone to dying rather than teenager from Covid?
2,Wooo! I love the Immune System series!
1,So why does your body repair some parts with collagen instead of having all tears regrown with cell regeneration? Is there a way to take away a scar and have your body regrow active tissue?
1,Thank you for this. People need to see this video and understand why vaccination is so important
2,Thanks again for an insightful video guys thumbs_up  always cool interesting and fun to learn it's good stuff cheers beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,What I learnt is the immune system doesn't follow the geneva convections
1,"Hey siri, look up who sponsors kurzgesagt and why they keep promoting vaccines"
1,Thank you Bill Gates for another shameless self-promotion of your vaccines that you want to sell.
2,We’re so lucky to have fun and interesting recourses like this that are such good quality! Each video really is like a piece of art red_heart
1,"To quote Norm Macdonald ""what doesn't kill you makes you very, very weak""."
1,Uau! Can we dub to our language to promote to the general population? Certainly keeping the data of who is the video generator.
1,"upside-down_faceBEWARE, good people of the Internet! Carbon footprint awareness only must be spread from the bottom to the top - and not the other way! Those MFckrs at WEF will definitaly play your self-awarenes like a fiddle and TAX the hell out of you the first second you'll let them! Personal responsobility is Personal! Have a great day."
1,How close are we to nanobots that patrol your bloodstream and kill anything that isn't supposed to be there?
1,I would say nature dojo isn't even a dojo. That's just going straight to the real fight with no training
1,"We have a similar saying here in Portugal
*_What doesn't kill you, makes you fatter_*"
1,Would have loved to get more details about auto immune desease
1,"I believe in nature over science, experience over expertise."
1,"i myself cant understand/learn with these animations, i need real life pictures to comprehend loudly_crying_face"
1,"You have erased from the calendar of human afflictions one of its greatest. 
Yours is the comfortable reflection that mankind can never forget that you have lived. 
Future nations will know, by history only, that the loathsome small-pox has existed and by you has been extirpated.
Accept my fervent wishes for your health and happiness
 ------Thomas Jefferson

yes, THAT Thomas Jefferson."
1,Where can i find citations for the claims made on this video?
1,Let me guess. Funded by the gates foundation and only peer reviewed by people on his payroll
1,Antivaxxers been real quiet since this dropped
1,Genetic engineering is unnecessary. Natural immunity > Magic science juice
1,no kidding  I just got over ITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura) my immune system attacked my platelets for no reason at all  its not fun but with some steroids and IVIG (Intravenous immune globulin) my platelets count is almost normal
1,me watching this with an infection in my elbow is really reassuring grinning_face_with_sweat
1,"My Grandma used to say ""People that never get sick, get sick to die"".
So I guess it makes sense if they are resistance to the average ailments but then it is like a bizarre lottery in where at some point some ""unimportant bug"" gets them and that was their kryptonite."
1,Still Americans Are weaker than average human beings from inside and also spends more on health than rest of the humans on this planet.
1,"Am I the only one who found the irony of the phrase
""Being vaccinated is one of the best tools to train your natural defenses"".

There have been conclusions that vaccines also cripple our immune system.its like mcdojos and when they teach you a ""counter"".that counter may work well on the mats in the safe dojo,but won't prepare you for a street fight."
1,"Just outright untrue that vaccines can give you a better immune system response to future diseases of that type. That is literally one of the primary weaknesses of vaccines, they give you a lesser form of immunity, and its a lab controlled version of the disease that might be weeks, months or years old to whatever you are trying to defend yourself from.

If there is any vaccine that actually does give a better response, then it is a very specific fringe case, likely due to the exact details of the illness in question. 

I've really started to dislike this channel on many videos, where it just tosses out extremely complex ideas like this and many others without any comprehensive backing for it."
1,"kurzgesagt is a propaganda channel for the Bill and Linda Gates Foundation, which most of their ""sources"" derive from. they announce this at the very end of most videos after their plugs. please be wary of propaganda, they hide it behind cute animations and a large vocabulary. it is designed to make you feel smart for agreeing with them. do not fall for it, it is propaganda from authoritarians"
1,I like everything about this except of the music.
1,"Me: naturally immune to covid 
Nice try china"
1,Can anyone answer why our immune system breaks down muscle not fat reserves?
1,"Except there is actual problems with some vaccines.
People have sustained and developed real chronic issues from the covid vaccine. It's rare but surely has something to do with the immune system and how your entire body responds to the vaccine. Not mentioning this makes me question who funded this video."
1,I have fever rightnow
1,Would've been nice if this video came out 3 years ago
1,This channel has turned to religious craziness instead of science. I escaped religion a long time ago and it’s time to unsubscribe.
1,"The dojo metaphor is a good one, because it models the possibility of a vaccine injury.  Unpopular opinion, but injuries can occur even though it's hopefully rare.  It's a question of risk-benefit analysis, and it's an individual calculation/educated guess.  A poorly designed vaccine could cause more than 'acceptable' injuries, which is why we should never become complacent about how serious it is to mandate vaccines.  We need a little humility in medicine, and government."
1,"""The immunity you get from a vaccine is often better then the natural resistance"" - Well yes, often, but not always, we see it in the covid case, and any other fast mutating viruses disease."
1,I have nasal allergy my immune system fucks me unnecessary how can i fix
1,"I haven't watched the video yet, but here's what I've been taught: the more you feed your immune system, the stronger it gets... Unless it's tetnis or anything ending in pox, and flu... except for the actual flu itself..."
1,"A video that explores vaping would be super beneficial for the younger audiences, as vaping has become insanely popular between teenagers, and compared to smoking vaping hasn't gotten any big news that it would be killing people with cancer, so I think it would be appropriate to touch on this topic, as you also mentioned smokers having worse symptoms when fighting viruses"
1,Lol Vaccine propaganda. You had me for a moment grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes
0,This is Pfizer/Moderna propaganda
1,I saw that coming. Preparing for the next pandemic? Let’s hope more peeps get the message
1,Done with this channel
2,"What doesn't kill you, evolves and tries again."
1,"Your sponsor, wren, carbon trading, is a complete scam. We'll look back on carbon trading as a massive detriment and distraction from address pollution. Currently, oil companies are 'offsetting' their carbon by building a few trees in Africa and claiming to have 'carbon neutral' petrol (Applegreen stations in Ireland). It's a system designed by wealthy Western nations for greenwashing. Disappointing you're taking their dirty money."
2,Thanks for your efforts smiling_face
1,"""Brought to you by Pfizer"""
1,"When people say ""What doesn't kill you make you stronger"" I keep thinking what would somebody who keep losing organ functions one after the other, watching your body keep deteriorating because of HIV or other similar stuff thinks about it."
1,"And for any idiots out there who start up with the ""Buh, da autism!"" crap, even _if_ that nonsense was true ... well, just watch the *Penn and Teller on Vaccinations* video."
1,"I personally know 3 people whose side effects are not just ""a bruise and a fever"", there is a lot more I found out when I looked it up. Everyone needs to look past the gaslighting."
1,"Nice. I always said, ""Whatever doesn't kill you probably makes you damaged."""
1, this grafh makes no sence right??
1,What if we throw our nuclear waste to the sun
1,Sponsored by gates foundation lol.
1,can i get a like been watching you from 10th grade and now even graduated college
1,"I don’t believe there is enough evidence yet that supports we are headed on a path to eradicate diseases “for good”. If anything, evidence points that many of the antibacterial efforts we have made are creating hazards in the long term."
1,The main reason I won't vaccinate is because I hate needles! Science needs to work on this
1,Previous infection is stronger than the covid vaccine. The video is misleading.
1,"Sounds like more Gates Foundation propaganda. “Live in a bubble so you never get sick, then take the thousands of shots we tell you to take.” Touch grass. Get some sun."
1,Bill gates has nothing to do with this video
0,"Fuck Propaganda, i cant believe i have been fooled by this channel for so long..."
1,"I got tinnitus and mild hearing loss from loud noise exposure. This video made me realize I might have lost cells related to hearing and got replaced by scars, which is depressing because I was music student and this affects me"
1,Please make a video about A.I.
1,Was the lead up to this video to try and convince people to get the covid shot?
1,You know it's a good day when Kurzgesagt remembers their password for their youtube channel
1,"How can vaccine acquire immunity be possibly better than natural immunity, which is acquired from actual full bacteria instead of a single part of it."
1,Bruh this is literally an ad for vaccines
1,"After watching this video, i got basic understanding how my immune system attacking my body right now. I amazed by the timing i got to watch this. Suffering from Rheumatoid Arthritis pain at midnight 12 am without proper sleep."
1,"Very well-researched and informative video.  I'll add this anecdotal evidence; please take with a grain of salt: a year ago, I got some bloodwork done and my doctor told me I was vitamin D deficient.  He recommended I supplement, so while I was at it, I found one that also included Vitamin C and Zinc.  I take this every morning and have not gotten sick since.  Multiple instances of my wife and both children being sick, and I remained completely unaffected."
1,Gates funded channel shilling vaccines again...
1,Its nice to already have watched the whole video
1,"This video is titled ""The Best Way to Boost Your Immune System"" but the only thing you mention is vaccines, which don't so much ""boost"" your immune system as they do grant immunity to specific pathogens. You cannot vaccinate someone against every infection since as you mentioned in the video, viruses and bacteria tend to mutate.

You never mention things that can actually boost your immune system such as having a balanced diet, vitamin supplements, exercise, getting enough sleep, etc. You should change the video title to something less misleading."
1,"So, no ""feed a cold and starve a fever"", eh?"
1,I cannot believe that we still need to tell people to vaccine
2,"The pixel arts and animations are insanely engaging, love it! Superb video as always party_popperparty_popperparty_popper"
0,Watching this while being sick and knowing whats going on in me is a very odd feeling.
1,in my case what didnt kill me left me with debilitating mental health issues and a general owed something attitude
0,this channel has turned into straight up propaganda it’s sad
1,A game version of this would be cool.
1,Ew a hit piece without any data. This video was bad.
1,"Science is like Magic, but real"
2, is the chef's kiss
2,Yeah thats the reason why rich kids are weak as fck
1,Martie is cracked at fortnite my guy
1,It's as what’s happened tothia channel.
1,"skeptical of anything that Kurzgesagt puts out. Falsely positions itself as an authority on science, doesn't know shit and can't conduct proper scientific research."
1,this is ridiculous
1,"I don't think we have covered/understood 0.0001% of what our immune system does, but Kurzgesagt is trying to make us understand it better, thanks Kurzgesagt!!!"
1,"everyone who thinks arguments are true or false needs to step back and ponder whether its more important to be made to think or to be shown what is true, and to ponder whether it is possible (at least realistically) for some idea/argument to be reduced to a status of true or false...

every statement which does something with a fact could be considered propaganda, and that may seem like a problem, but really it seems to me that the only thing which would make that a problem is the control of propaganda, or the silencing of some over others. just dont limit communication and let us bask in all of it, and least that may be our best shot at not fucking up as much as possible over time"
1,I’m watching this while I have the flu and currently undertaking bioscience so have an under of what happens which is very interesting.
0,wilhelm scream @ 
1,"@internetbreach Hi, could you tell me what was maliny squeaky noise on your Astra K? I have the same problem."
1,So basically those who haven't taken the vaccine yet should go and take it now or kiss your life goodbye
1,"A great way to stay healthy is by eating properly and exercising, which takes the kind of self control clearly lacking from the character in this video."
1,"Lol vaccine your kid against COVID lol

We see What happen last year's about Pfizer lol"
1,"UNSUB NOW!!! Biased channel, Bill Gates and Soros funded!  Steer clear of their agenda!!"
1,"SUnlight helped me get over covid back in 2021.
I felt enough better to force myself to get sun exposure and that was the beginning of y recovery."
1,"I made my Covid Vaccine shot in november 2021.
Some weeks later i was fighting for a pericarditis, or to correct myself, I AM FIGHTING IT, doing an injection of interleukin-1 inibitor  in my belly everyday, and in some months will be a year.
Some days ago i went to the hospital for the control, and the doctor said clearly that with this type of pericarditis there's a good possibility that i will be obliged to do the injections for the rest of my life.
I'm not anti-vax, the vaccines saved milions, or maybe billions of people around the world, but i hate when someone say that the vaccine are completely safe, it's an ID10T like the anti-vax.
The vaccines are drugs, and like all drugs are capable of creating side effects, so please, stop saying only things that are a single part of the actual reality, because with this you would only get more people away from the knowledge that are you trying to explain to the others.

Sorry for the bad english, but i'm not an english motherlanguage."
1,"This video is wack. ""Thats why some young people died from covid and to older people it was a mild cold"". Like, WHAT? Yall just flat out lying"
2,I really wish that in school everything was presented like this
1,"My carbon footprint? Don't make me laugh... if future generations and corporations have to ""suffer"" (while making billions) for me to have a somewhat decent and somewhat comfortable life; SO BE IT.  I would go out and chop trees myself."
1,No Vax are basically like tutorial-skip gamers.
1,"Uh huh. Not buying it. Our immune system is the best thing we've got against a world that wants to kill us.

This video sponsored by Pfizer."
0,So does cell become cancer because it want to avoid being kill by immune system?
1,"Another insightful video! 
I'd love a Kurzgesagt video specifically about auto-immune diseases. It seems fitting given how many times the immune system has been covered by you guys!"
1,Man lefties sure like saying stuff is a spectrum
1,I'm generally very in favor of vaccines but Pfizer is sus.  It was *probably* a net force for good but dishonest and I don't appreciate that.  I'm going to be much more cautious about new medications from now on.
1,Brought to you by phyzer.
1,The video thumbnail of this video just shows what I experienced when I fell sick.face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy
1,"definitely some people well say you're working for the government because some people doesn't believe vaccines
but I do believe vaccines I just think of that while watching your video very cool video by the way"
0,Nice video until you had the stupid climate change crap at the end.
1, The ape is eating a virus
1,Sometimes in vaccine dojo you get clots and heart attacks.
1,"disgusting bs hidden within the truth your recent videos just seem to be sponsored by the WEF and Pfizerthumbs_down
if you want to boost your immune system eat healthy (including animal based proteins and fats), do mobility and cardio exercises, lift heavy once in a while at least, be social"
1,I can't believe Kurzgezagt has capitulated to Deep State propaganda!! grinning_face_with_big_eyes
1,"first we were a planet, then we're giant countries.
I really want to know what's next. No, scratch that, I don't."
1,"The question is: which diseases cause the body to do a “direct cell replacement” which is just as good as the original cells, and which ones cause the body to do a “patch job” that aren’t as good as the original cells. Damaged cells caused by cold, flu, COVID (except when there is severe damage to the lungs), stomach virus, etc. can be directly replaced with new cells that are just as good as the original ones. However, with heart diseases and neurological diseases, it’s a patch job. I’m no doctor or a scientist, but based on my reading this is what I understood. I personally prefer not to get vaccinated for the flu or COVID. I am, however, vaccinated since I was a child for other serious diseases and that’s important."
1,They are losing the narrative over vaccines.  The trouble was never the science.  At issue is the need to trust multi-national corporations that are not worthy of our trust.
1,"I both love and hate my immune system, it can shun off COVID in around a day but I’ve gotten Type A Flu several times in the past year a couple of months apart even after getting vaccinated for type A Flu"
1,This is such a beautiful way to explain this whole system
1,Waiting for anti vaxers to flood my comment here with their testimony and myriad of historical evidence of dubious information on whether vaccine distribution were ethically executed lol.
1,Found the Wilhelm scream in the video.
1,I'm gonna send this video to an antivaxxer
1,The tile should be: '' Why would you be vaccinated.''
1," Is that a reference to Philipp Dettmer's ""Immun""? I remember that line in the book very clearly."
1,Why does this feel like a shill video when vaccines have just been done a significant PR blow with the ridiculous Covid vaccines. Prior to that things were going well for pharma.
1," I haven't paid attention to the statistics since 2020, but I clearly remember the general consensus being that young healthy people have a very low mortality rate and in contrast elderly people quite a high one. Why is it flipped in the video?"
1,"Still not taking it, i shouldn't have to if your's works. I like how you said how vaccines pretend to be the disease but until 2020 vaccines were the disease just attenuated. Your bias is showing and im certain all these died suddenlys floating about are all from these tiny wounds made and nothing to do with a still untested 'vaccine'. enjoy your regret clots NO REFUNDS!"
2,I'm just so in love with this channel xD
2,"Thanks for this video, it was awessome. Please keep up the  good work."
2,Again not a word on exercising and vitamins
1,"Everybody with an immune disorder is like ""yea obviously"""
2,"about strength of immune responses, this would have been a good tie-in for allergies"
1,Only of that was tough at schools. We would already live in the future.
1,"You know this channel is a pharma shill when the only thing they recommend for strengthening your immune system is by getting vaccinated. 

The cherry on top was the transition into climate change. clown_face"
1,Yes but we now know that the corona vaccine was a big scam... Mmmm....
1,grinning_face_with_sweatgrinning_face_with_sweatgrinning_face_with_sweat
1,"I was kinda hoping a video titled this would go more into autoimmune diseases. Personally, mine caused me stroke. I'd say that's a pretty big danger xD"
1,Dr. Hibbert was right.
1,"Great video. It reminds me again: No vaccines. No internet to troll on with vaccine disinformation.

If humanity hadn't developed vaccines, we would likely never have advanced our civilizations to the point we have."
1,"""this is why some young healthy people died from COVID"" why the past tense?"
1,Insane... I didn't know getting sick often can make me skinnier by using the protein from my own muscles.
1,They're lying to you.
2,nice fancy colors on that propaganda
1,and people are against vaccines woman_facepalmingwoman_facepalming
1,I can watch his channel all day
1,"With the vaccine You get a black eye, a blood clot or a myocarditis grinning_face_with_sweat"
1,"While vaccin DoJo works strong against specific virus variants, nature dojo has a weaker, but wider protection. I've been training in nature dojo for years (I work with kids) and I can recommend this for young healty people. Not sure yet if I will change meta as soon I get older and weaker, but for now I know my preference."
1,"Could you do a video on mRNA vaccins, how they work and background on the early studies into newly discovered risks & side effects?"
1,"I'd like an expansion on the lung dmg from sickness. Because while ""immunity"" to future illness can happen, variants or other viruses/bacteria/phages that attack the same now-weakened-by-scar-tissue-organs, will absolutely DEVASTATE the body. EG: someones lungs after covid, or after mono/pneumonia/bronchitis"
1,"  ""Imagen crazy aggressive chimps with machine guns"""
0,"That was a dumb analogy, more old people died from covid than young. Why are you cherry picking for the fake news?"
1,Didn't understood  part completely
1,The music disrupts my continuous focus. pensive_face
1,Imagine the geneva convention didn't apply to your immune system and its still using chemical weapons
1,Misleading title as if it was serving mRNA industry!
1,"Friends... I've always admired and supported you by buying merch and whatnot. Please don't cave into pressure. 
If you're going to insist on people getting the COVID vaccine please do a video on why MRNA vaccines are not true vaccines.

And the fact that the first round of vaccines do little to  NOTHING to the new variants of COVID

And how if we accept that we need the COVID ""vaccines"" we also have to accept that we need to get a new shot every 6-9 months haha which is laughable 

Please don't fall to peer pressure and continue doing what you've always done. Be honest with the science and don't just cover half truths"
1,"People who brag about never getting sick, do they have a strong or weak immune system? If feeling sick is a side effect of your immune system at work, doesn't mean being sick that you're immune system works great? And if you don't get sick, doesn't that mean your immune system is weak?"
1,"How ironic, Im just getting over a bad flu.
 
However Carbon Dioxide is a great gas! Its a green gas and keeps the planet GREEN!
The green trees and crops (food) require it. 
The notion that CO2 increases will end us all is not true. 

See how big and ripe Tomatoes grow if you increase its CO2 and how small and green they are when CO2 is reduced.

They want you to grow Monsanto food and if we continue the fight against CO2 their GM seeds will be the only thing that grows on a dead GM earth. DYOR"
1,"Kurzgesagt: Carbon Footprint was propaganda made by BP to shift blame on to you
Also Kurzgesagt: Here is how you can lower your carbon footprint"
1," No, that is alphabet soup, you can't convince me otherwise."
0, Carbon footprints are a scam. Go boycott the 100 companies responsible.
1,"Unless it's a MRNA vaccine, which now has overwhelming evidence showing it causes inflammation of the heart, with A huge rise of heart attacks in 20-40 year olds."
1,I'd like to hear from the 5% of people who disliked this video why? It's one of the higher dislike ratios on Kurzgesagt.
2,"It’s crazy how good the animations are on this video, the animation team deserve more respect!"
1,Totally misleading on the balance and effectiveness of vaccine vs natural immunity. Also misleading regarding the risk of COVID to young people versus the elderly.
1,Sus skyton-thingy
2,I love the immune system videos
1,"I'm in quarantine rn with two of my three roommates also infected with covid. Found out the day before I tested positive that my boss doesn't actually know how vaccines work and is very much of the ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and also you're better off going natural"" camp. Y'all... I work in a restaurant..."
2,"If thiw is true, then yeah im gonna spew these out"
2,"I want to say MOST(99.9%) of vaccines are good, but a few of them arent as good..."
1,"My grandma is 88 with health issues. She got covid and was essentially asymptomatic with a bit of a cough for a day. Meanwhile I’m in my 20s and healthy and when I got it, it was the sickest I’ve ever been. Our immune system is wild!"
1,"Vitamin D \ Sun exposure \Good food  \Exercise
Boosters will just worsen your helath."
1,Would drinking sugary water considered a good idea if our bodies need extra energy when fighting off the disease? A quick carb boost would help the cells wouldn’t it as digesting sugar doesnt really take a lot of energy. Any ideas?
1,"I am a big of this channel and watch all videos, however I’ve very disappointed that they claimed in this video “vaccine immunity is often better than natural resistance” - garbage."
1,"This is what happened to me basically. For 6 months during the cross country season, I was sick but still running every day. I ended up with a disappointing time and now I wish I just took a week off to recover."
1,Next do a show talking about how Covid was man made and designed to stick with our species forever.

0,"I have long covid, and it didnt kill me, but it sure as fucking hell did NOT make me stronger. its ruined my fkin life."
1,"I came for the internet virologist screeds and didn't leave disappointed. Only question I have is this: why do they persist and insist on showing off their echo-chamber knowledge only to get laughed at by the rest of the world? It's as if the more they are laughed at, they more they believe they are right. It's stupid, but that doesn't stop them!"
1,Please make a video about envy
1,Mostly agree with this video. Obviously encouraging people to get vaccinated. The only thing that make me cautious is about using experimental vaccine like the one we know… one subject that should be discussed is the risk/reward ratio. When is it worth injecting experimental drug to young individual when they are probably not going to get hurt vs potential unknown side effect. Huge fan of Kurtzgesagst but I kinda feel this video is eluding an important part of the subject: risk/reward of taking drugs
1,Big Pharma propaganda? Unsubscribed!
1,is this an april fool's joke? there are no vaccines against 99 % of all sicknesses so how can vaccines be the most effective way to boost your immune system. is there a vaccine against cancer? what a horribly misleading title.
1,Take that antivaccers!
1,When are you going to do a video on the permanent damage caused by the vaxx?
1,Saying vaccine immunity is better than natural immunity is really stupid and false. You literally only ever started hearing this once the COVID vaccines rolled out and it's misinformation. :/ Sad to see it from you all.
1,"I agree with almost all of this but seriously stop calling the covid vaccine what it ain't. It's an experimental vaccine STILL. Want me to change my mind, easy, just wait 10 or so years or show me in excruciating detail how the newest of these vaccines have been made the old fashioned way. And even then, the wait period for it to be safe is STILL 10 YEARS. Call it stupid call it antivax I don't give a flying shit. I'm not putting something in my body that could risk killing me. So stop talking about it as if it's a normal vaccine cuz it ain't. I've had normal vaccines, this ain't that. Oh and finally as the last straw, if this was already in production for 10 years, why is it only now public knowledge? You want me to distrust you as a source? You know what just talk about aliens and space some more. 

Also, the reason why I sadi that last thing, a kid doesn't die from the measles, adults do. Adults don't die from the flu, the elderly do. Does logic justt fly out the window when it comes to vaccines? From what I recall, being taught by literal biologists, measles needs a vaccine because it's so rare and you can escape it easily as a kid making you vulnerable the moment you turn adult. As well, the flu is such a regular virus, it doesn't kill adults ESPECIALLY if they're healthy. It kills the elderly because their immune system is weaker than when they were in their prime. That's why kids can also die from it depending on a lot of factors.

Don't you DARE think I don't know what I'm talking about because I had a weak immune system. I was sick almost every month when I was a kid, don't you think I would research why and find countermeasures? That's why I won't outright unsub from you but this one gets a dislike. You want a strong immune system? Go outside and play around in the dirt. Do not wash your hands unless they got too dirty to eat with. And most importtantly when you do wash em, only use lukewarm water for at least 30 seconds. No antibactterial shit. Killing bacteria makes your body think that you got it covered and makes you more vulnerable when you do catch a virus. Let the body do it's work. Trust in your body. But don't neglect it. For fucks sake get back some common sense. THIS WAS COMMON KNOWLEDGE. At least it was when I was a teen.

One more that warrants being said because there are so many weak willed people around nowadays. If it's your time it's your god damn time. There is nothing you can do about it. Anything but the covid vaccine is a good help definitely. But learn more about nature by going to it. I am suddenly very glad I made this my last year on youtube"
2,Thanks you Bill Gates for this video!!!
1,"Sponsored bye Pfizer, blah"
1,I'll take the nature dojo B)
1,I like the fact that the gorrilla is sniffing a virus in the intro
1,Brought to you by Pfizer
1,This better talk about how the immune system can kill you faster than a disease
1,real happiness is when a new kurzegasagt video shows up
1,I don't agree with this. I'm in my mid 60's and have a strong immune system. I don't follow the science. I will keep doing what I'm doing with natural supplements and anti-viral supplements. It works and has a proven track record. I never got covid or any viruses.
1,even after so much knowledge and experience still the defense cells destroys everything in battle against viruses
1,"Isnt it a stronger immune system the more harmful and the more sick you get? If your immune system isn't reacting, you wont get a fever or aches or feel weak as those are immune responses"
1,Or you ger myocarditis
1,Another masterpiece. Keep up the awesome work!
1,"This video was brought to you by WHO. Y'know, the company that imposed people with vaccines such as J&J, AZ, and MDA and caused a lot of people their lives because none of the vaccines had been fully tested and the companies themselves didn't bother to think that people's bodies would react differently to them?"

1,By drinking bleaching water according to trump
1,you need to rethink that whole vaccines are better the natural immunity except when their not as it is both misleading in how the facts are presented and stray into the realm of opinion presented as fact. I would remove it and restate things in a way that leaves the opinions up to the listener.
1,"Having access to good health care for everyone is also kinda important. Odd that the richest most powerful country in the world has some of the worst and most expensive healthcare. People from the US literally fly to India to have major surgery done because it's cheaper and safer. You deserve better. Sometimes the virus or infection isn't something you see directly, it infects the things around you instead. When you use your resources of working full time and it can't even afford the ambulance ride that in many other countries is free then maybe the disease is somewhere else."
1,"There's also great research on the power of intermittent fasting and/or a keto diet to enable a stronger immune system whilst repairing damaged cells and starving cancer cells etc. In a basic sense, it can trigger autophagy (celluar recycling)"
2,"YAAAY, we love immune system"
1," This is untrue.  Natural immunity is superior to ""vaccine Immunity""; a term invented from whole cloth.
 No, you're very paid to talk about this topic.  Remember kids, lobbying is bad, unless it's Kurzgesagt receiving the money.  Then it's okay."
1,cells at work
1,"So in nutshell you want to say vaccination is required for all the disease. 
So that means we have to take millions of vaccine to train a immune system."
1,And yet we have anti-vaxxers.  The human race is doomed.
2,Interesting and helpful thank you raising_handsyin_yangfolded_hands
1,"So it a fever is your bodies way of producing more heat to make a more hostile environment for invaders, then why do we sometimes get chills when we’re sick?"
1,"What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.
Unless it maims you.
I mean if that first saying was completely true I'd break every bone in my body so I could move toward being invincible.
Ugh...my mom keeps sending me cheerful platitudes and quite frankly she should know I'm too pessimistic and cynical for that."
1,"Best way to train your immune system is to spend time in nature, your innate and auto immune systems are constantly working, add good sleep, hydration,  a healthy diet and lifestyle to that and you're golden, that should be the first port of call. There is a place for other drugs to be I introduced but it's dishonest to push that as the 'best' form of defence... Let's educate responsibly...  Yours

 -John 
God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. 

We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him. 
We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself on the cross and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins. 

He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven

Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends

When Jesus Christ returns, he will take his children home, and hundreds of millions of people will disappear in a brief moment! When you see this event take place, please remember these words, and understand that the Rapture has just taken place! Please remember that the Christians tried to warn you of this coming day, and that God is real, and his name is Jesus Christ!

Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.

""And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be."" Revelation 

May God Bless you all in Jesus holy name!

The END of life as we know it is upon us my Friends!

""Title: Aerospike Engines: The Future of Space Propulsion?

Opening shot of a rocket launch.

Narrator: ""When we think of rocket engines, we often picture the iconic bell-shaped nozzle. But what if I told you that there's another type of engine that's more efficient and could revolutionize space travel as we know it?""

Cut to an animation of an aerospike engine.

Narrator: ""Meet the aerospike engine. It looks very different from a traditional rocket engine, with a unique shape that resembles a wedge or a triangle.""

Cut to a cross-sectional view of an aerospike engine.

Narrator: ""The aerospike engine works by using the atmosphere itself as part of the engine. Instead of a single bell-shaped nozzle, the aerospike engine has a series of smaller nozzles arranged in a circular pattern around the engine's base. As the rocket ascends, the air pressure decreases, and the engine's exhaust gases expand to fill the surrounding air. This creates a virtual bell-shaped nozzle that optimizes thrust for the altitude and speed of the rocket.""

Cut to an animation of an aerospike engine in action.

Narrator: ""This unique design has several advantages over traditional rocket engines. For one, it's more efficient. Traditional engines lose efficiency as they ascend, since they're optimized for a specific altitude and pressure range. But the aerospike engine adjusts to the changing conditions of the atmosphere, making it more efficient overall.""

Cut to a comparison shot of a traditional engine and an aerospike engine.

Narrator: ""In fact, studies have shown that aerospike engines can achieve up to 30% better fuel efficiency than traditional engines. This means that rockets can carry more payload or travel further on the same amount of fuel.""

Cut to an animation of a rocket carrying a payload.

Narrator: ""Another advantage of aerospike engines is their versatility. They can be used for both atmospheric and vacuum propulsion, meaning that a single engine could take a rocket from Earth's surface to the vacuum of space without needing to switch engines.""

Cut to a shot of a rocket launching.

Narrator: ""However, aerospike engines are not without their challenges. They're more complex and difficult to manufacture than traditional engines, and their performance can be affected by the materials they're made from and the precise geometry of their nozzles.""

Cut to an animation of an aerospike engine being manufactured.

Narrator: ""But despite these challenges, the potential benefits of aerospike engines make them a promising candidate for the future of space propulsion. With further research and development, they could help us explore deeper into space and make space travel more efficient and accessible for all.""

Closing shot of a rocket launch.

Narrator: ""Who knows? Maybe the next time we see a rocket launch, it'll be powered by an aerospike engine.""

2,One of the best cannels on YouTube.
1,"A video on the immune system and the importance of vaccines but no mention of Vit D? Vitamin D is the actuator of your immune system. It ensures an appropriate and quick response to infection and... that's right, vaccination. Going to get a vaccine? Get your vit D levels up first! Low vit D equals a lethargic immune response and less established defense resulting from vaccination.
The video mentions how vaccine can equal a better immune defense because it is engineered for the disease. This seems unlikely in several scenarios. Particularly unlikely when it comes to... I think you know what. This is because the vaccine for that is focused on a single component of the virus and thus this is the only target for your system to build a defensive army against. Whereas an exposure to the full virus allows the system to build a multi, multi, multi, faceted defense using every opportunity it finds. Not saying vaccine doesn't work or anything like that, but, better than natural immunity? I really don't think so. Regarding the risk of potential damage & 'downside' of facing infections unprotected... agreed. Just be advised, one of the best and most important things you can do for your immune system is, get quality sleep, and KEEP UP YOUR VITAMIN D."

One thing i find a bit disturbing though is the lack of info shared about the immunity boost you get from generally taking care of your body: exercising, diet, supplementing.

I believe vaccines are absolutely necessary in some, very important cases, but for others, simply taking care of yourself might be more beneficial, or at least help."

1,"got covid, sick for 1 week, nearly pass out end stuff...
got vaccine, sick for like 2 days and not that bad...

That's because i already experimented the virus and my body knew what to do with it already, and when got the vaccine it attacked the simulated virus more effectively?
but if i have survived the ""Nature Dojo"" why did i get sick from the vaccine afterwords at all? if i get the virus for the 3rd time, will i have a better time? won't be that sick because my body had experimented it 2 times in the past and now is really really good at this type of virus?"

1,it's good to see that this channel is now being covertly (and probably indirectly) sponsored by drug companies. The channel already told us that the UN sponsors them in the recent video on how the channel makes money so knowing that the UN works with the World Health Org there's no suprise that big pharma probably have something to do with the content narrative of this video promoting vaccines.

1,"Not a great time to be releasing this considering how many freedoms were stripped over this very topic. Statistically speaking you are fine, there is nothing to fear, if we use the small percentile as an example for everything then this world will seem like it's a death trap. Meanwhile there are billions of us and there are millions upon millions of elderly and millions upon millions of people living healthy lives.

I like the information that is provided, but this feels like scaremongering, if you don't get vaccinated than any type of illness will scar your tissue thus long-term decreasing your lifespan. You may live a healthy life but you don't know and never will know therefore you may as well get vaccines as they come.

It's like people are forgetting that the human body is extremely complex and there are things that they thought were safe that caused cancer or other issues 15 years down the road. Most typical vaccines given to individuals have been given to individuals for decades, the research has been done and the long term has been shown to be safe. But to strip the voice of the people away and force a vaccine down their throat that has ""20 years"" of experimental research, something like what 6 months of development? And then they pumped it out and said you won't be able to do anything unless you take this.

It's one hell of a world we are living in today. It is very unfortunate that people have passed away from this sickness, but there is a limit to what lengths the world should go to for the minority if it involves destruction of everything that people have died for over the past century."

1,"I have a family friend who is currently in a coma from the coranavirus vaccine. Vaccines are great but there could be side effects, you should prolly still take vaccines but i just wanted to put this out there. Cuz it's really painful being in a coma after a vaccine that's meant to protect you"

0,Its funny how this video came out when i am sick
1,"I'm one of the lucky ones as I was born with a very stable, healthy and strong immune system despite growing up under cared for, so I rarely get truly sick

Lets just hope it stays friendly lmao"
2,It was interesting topic until it became too obvious what you are doing.
2,"the more i watch Kurzgesagt videos, the more my faith in god increase, thank you Kurzgesagt"
1,The timing of this video... My household was sick one after another for a week and yesterday finally everyone is feeling better
2,Great timing to promote vaccination! Thank you a lot
1,Usually vaccines are tested for many years before they are approved. It is not a mage stick at all.
1,Wish you guys had covered the different types of vaccines and the body response to each.

1,"Let me preface by saying I’m not an anti-vaxxer and I even got vaccines over the course of covid. Kurzgesant makes some good points in this video including with vaccinations. You should be aware of the risks involved with taking these. Not only can they not work in some cases but they can give you blood clots, enlarge organs like your heart, and can give you Guillain Barre syndrome. All of which happened to my cousin after the vaccinations and her quality of life has gone down drastically because of this. Understand the risks involved with some of these. We need to make sure we’re fighting viruses but minimizing long term effects."
1,I think I am good at killing covid lots of infected where near me even before I was fully protected never got it
1,******Video sponsored by Pfizer and made with papers sponsored by Pfizer
1,"FINALLY
the immune system"
1,"This video is slightly wrong. All doctors agree that natural immunity is better than vaccine acquired immunity. It also forgets to mention the importance of vitamin D. Studies show that those with severe covid symptoms also had lower levels of vitamin D than required/recommended. There are no side effects to taking vitamin D, there is however side effects with vaccines, some that are quite severe! More emphasis needs to be on getting the right nutrients to strengthen the immune system."

1,If only the vaccine for the latest pandemic had been more effective than natural immunity.
1,I wonder if this video has a political bias…
1,3 weeks ago? hope you got the money upfront cause the people who actually watch this channel wont be tuning in to the biased scams you're running
1,Now do one on the difference between traditional dead virus vaccines and the MRNA vaccine.
1,"I wish I got sick for a few days after I got a flu shot man I had server anxiety and thought everyone around me was going to die for 4 months. And this started a week after getting the shot. The afternoon i got it my leg hert and I was limping for a week then boom server anxiety, litteraly had moments of clarity and would beg my parents for help this was when I was in 6th grade and I dident even know it was a flu shot until my parents started freaking out ab my behavior and looked it up"
1,imagine watching this video with all the facts simplified and still not believing how your body works.
1,"man these videos hit different once you find out these guys take bribes and use biased sources to appease the people they take bribes from

""How Kurzgesagt Cooks Propaganda For Billionaires - The Hated One"" search it on youtube"
1,"Kurzgesagt spreading fake news again, huh. Vaccines ARE magic, they are incredible achievements of science and engineering that have saved countless people from suffering and death and they even come in small bottles like magical elixirs, if that's not magic then I don't know what is."
1,"Now I get it, in 2021 my sister and I take a vaccine. Then I saw the difference, my sister was sick after receiving the vaccine and I was still healthy after receiving those vaccine. So my sister maybe have a little weak response to the vaccine and my immune system have a strong response. So that's why I always tho vaccine protect me from COVID-19"
1,"So I see that Bill & Melinda Foundation money you got are put to good use in promoting their investments into Biontech and other pharma companies. 
That 20:1 return Bill mentioned getting from investing 1 billion into the pandemic jabby solutions don't seem that far fetched now.


You damned liars, the chance of dying from the corona for under 18 -20's was virtually 0. ZERO! 
Dr. John Campbell presented recently official documents and statistics that prove once again what we already know that the corona is an upper respiratory infectious disease with a very low mortality rate, mostly in the elderly (over 80 years old)  that can be easily survived if you get a heathy immune system (sun, exercise, good food, vitamin D3+k2) and if you actually get worse symptoms ( as in the old and with comorbidities) there are quite a few alternative early treatments (that were heavily suppressed by govt and media almost all over the world) with a very high success rate.

Kurzgesagt , with every video you make it is more and more obvious the agenda you support. May you get your just rewards for that."
2,Great vid!
1,"I didn't take the covid vaccine and never will under any circumstances. There's nothing you can do about it but be angry about on the internet, the only domain where you cannot be physically persuaded to be silent."
1,"she's fat, that's unhealthy"
1,"Cytokine storms are a good example of how relentless the immune system can be.  imagine him lashing out with everything he can in an almost suicidal maneuver in an attempt to contain a pathogen.  the stronger your immune system is the worse the damage done to the rest of the body, this is one of the reasons why many young people die from COVID-19"
1,how much?
1,"When I was 12 years old I contracted glandular fever (ie, the epstein-barr virus) and since then my body has never been the same. It completely destroyed my life. I'm now in my 20s and suffer from multiple autoimmune disorders, unable to work, have chronic pain, etc. So... yeah. Amazing what one small, pesky virus can do and how devastating the immune system can be when it turns on you."
1,"I get the analogy, but I really dislike talking about war in such a lighthearted way. Anyway, as always, great video!"
1,i boost my immune system by watching eggs cook.

2,Love the dojo analogy
1,"aww, come on guys, clickbait thumbnail? really?"
1,How much did pfeizer pay you to be a shill for vaccines? Maybe you should do a video on how it has been proven that natural covid immunity is better than the “vaccine”. Maybe a video on how more people died after the “vaccines” rolled out than before. You have just ruined your credibility and therefore aren’t worth my views anymore. Good luck being a mouthpiece for the commies.
1,"I believe i am good at holding off infections as ai often get cut and get them dirty, often by playing in mud.

1," - Vaccines are indeed an incredible achievement. But just because something is called a vaccine doesn't make it good. They vary widely in quality. In the past, there have been vaccines that have been pulled because they were too dangerous. I really dislike your intimation that anything someone calls a vaccine is automatically good for you and better for you than getting the disease.

For the CCP virus, studies have shown recently that natural immunity from getting the disease gives you better quality immunity in almost all respects than any of the currently available vaccines. And also, the most heavily pushed vaccines, the mRNA vaccines, are actually more dangerous for many classes of people than getting the disease is. And, in fact, these vaccines can lead to exactly the kind of permanent tissue damage your video warns about with regards to disease.

 - From everything I understand about how the immune system works this is just patently false, most of the time. In the case of some particular diseases (like measles) it's true. But in general it isn't. And very specifically, the mRNA vaccines are significantly inferior. They are inferior because they only encourage your body to make memory cells specific to one antigen instead of making a variety of memory cells that match several antigens. That makes it easy for the virus to evolve away from your immune system's ability to counter it because it only has to sufficiently change one antigen rather than changing a whole host of them at the same time.

By omitting these facts, this video crosses over from being useful information to being propaganda. And by being propaganda that people can easily spot, you actually increase people's distrust for vaccines that are almost certainly better than getting the disease is, like the measles vaccine.

I've come to expect better from you in most cases. Your willingness to acknowledge bias and error in the past has been pretty impressive. Please do better now."

1,"In university, I learned that vaccines are not superior, but often inferior to infections regarding long-lasting immunity. I am curious about where you found the opposite.

1,"Neat video, I think I will unsubscribe. Thank you for your interesting content while it lasted, maybe I'll end up resubscribing one day if you ever end up making fun videos again."
1,"This was really good until you started on about vaxs. The c19 ""vax"" is not a vax but poison and that's a fact. This is misleading and misinformation. You should be ashamed of yourself."
1,"you guys failed to mention, over vaccinating, over medication, and too much treatment. I was waiting for that part.... great video. i think its missing that side of the puzzle, you dont want to crutch your immune system by eating medicine every day."
1,so the best way to boost your immune system is basically taking lots of vaccines

1,"""The idea that you can weather all sorts of diseases if you never get a cold, is wrong"" You idiots. What if I eat off of the floor to condition my immune system?"
1,"Careful, maybe some crazy person interprets you pushing vaccines as you being fully sponsored by billionares!
Jokes aside I'd have loved if some minor things that affect immune responses were discussed like vitamin D, zinc, eating well while being sick and so on."
1,It's insane how comforting Kurzgesagt videos are
1,Covid vaccine was paper dojo with real nunchucks. Myocarditis in young folks is no joke.
1,Crazy alt-right antivaxx angry posters incoming
1,"So those who got high fever after vaccine because there immunity wasn't ready for the disease like those who got high fever after covid vaccine could had covid or those who was fine after vaccine could have better immunity against covid(not totally immune)
Well after vaccine sure there immunity changed but still is this concept I just said was it right??"
1,"Could you do a video on what other ways there are to ""train"" your immune system? And maybe demystify what ways actually do not work."
0,What doesn't kill you makes you stronger is one of those stupid sayings that you have to ignore a lot of shit for it to be true.
1,I agree with vaccines I just thought this vid would be about eating your vegetables or suming
1,Despite of getting vaccined there were'nt (m)any advices..?!
1,"""Ok, this sounds depressing"" should be the slogan of Kurzgesagt :D"

1,"Thanks for the information​ Bill,  im sure there is not alt motive."
1,"Incidentally, midwits like Kurzgesagt actually help spread the ""sacramental"" notion of vaccines, which isn't science but mere superstition"
1,Wrong! What about all the actual deficiencies like magnesium and most of all that you even never thought of coq10 as a standard
1,"Pls explain  about how medicine works, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol"
1,To bad the b orona jab was made only was a political bargaining chip and is roughly 30-2% effective nowadays
1,Thanks for another outstanding video to make the immense complexity of immune system easier to understand. I’ve bought your book “Immune” and totally enjoyed reading it. So glad you’ve updated some of the info and put it into video form. Keep up your great work! red_heartred_heartred_heartred_heartred_heart

2,This is such a good video!! Well done
1,"wow a vaccine propaganda video, what a surprise. neat how there was no mention of any lifestyle changes you can make to improve your immune system except not smoking."
1,"My POTS went from mild and tolerable to crippling after a mild case of COVID so yeah, what doesn't kill you knocks you flat on your ass forever confused_face"
1,Survived coronavirus without vaccination
1,"And sometimes when you go to the vaccine dojo, you aren't made aware that it's not a vaccine dojo but a gene therapy dojo and carry the risk of myocarditis."
1,"I have been enjoying this channel for years now. Loved the cute animations, the topics, everything. But...

After learning of: 
1) Your failure to disclose that you are getting sponsored to produce a particular video.
2) Your lazy research citing practices (using a single source for most of your information that is heavily funded by the same people 'granting' large sums of $$ to you).

I do not know if I can in good conscious continue supporting this channel. If you ever become more transparent of where your money comes from and don't rely so heavily on a singular source with questionable motivations, then maybe I will come back. Until then, I bid you farewell for now."
1,How many young kids died from covid?? I hope this is only a typo
1,This is the first time I have left a dislike on a Kurzgesagt video. Sad to see them get corrupted by the system and push this kind of propoganda.
1,"Nothing made me realize that extream intelligence is in every layer of life. Even microscopic. We move in the same way and have the same nature at every level. Our immune system truly functions like an army, everything has a specialty...just...like...us. Its so fascinating."

1,"Kurz.. is a propaganda machine. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Their take on nuclear fission was sus af tho. The tiny blurbs are common sense but not science and should be stowed, such as the smoking line. Smoking weakens many people, sure.. but tossing out partial truths makes everything you say suspect. Btw, I'm not a smoker.. of cigarettes nor the occasional cigar.. but your use of ""smoking"" is bad doesn't examine the different types of smoke nor give clear evidence of supposition, but does mar your science with apparent agenda."
1,"This video was nothing but propaganda.
'Your immune system doesn't help you, in fact it makes your body weaker, and makes it so your organs don't work as well.' 'The only way to truly protect yourself is a vaccine.'
I'm not anti vaccine in any way, shape of form but I'm also not going to pretend that vaccines are magic and the only way that humans can survive anything. This is propaganda. And propaganda that makes a few people a ton of money. I wonder who funded this video. 
'You should check your personal carbon footprint using our new app.' This is propaganda that has been debunked for multiple decades. in the 1990s Shell corporation decided that a great way to deflect from their industry's roll on the climate crisis is to make it look like average people have an disproportionate effect on the climate. They called it a Personal Carbon Footprint.
I think it's time that Kurzgesagt makes their donors known. I know that other channels are looking into who's actually funding you. People are not dumb enough to think that you're funding this whole thing solely through Patreon donations."

1,oh please dont pretend long covid is a real thing
1,Propagandist nonsense. This assumes vaccine manufacturers do proper quality control and don't sell bad batches to poor people just so directors can upgrade their super yachts. Trust in corporations has been eroded for good reason.
1, That graph is illegal.
1,"I try to have this conversation with my patients. Sadly, so many ""don't trust science"" anymore. Which makes no sense - science has only gotten better. People have started listening to politicians and ignorant people with big loudspeakers. Apparently that now beats out science. 

Our bodies may have evolved well, but our intelligence seems to be going backwards."
1,"That saying references your experience, battles etc. Not illnesses... Still interesting"
1,"You guys should do a video about training your immune system via eating a natural whole food diet that specifically cuts out simple refined carbohydrates, seed oils, and synthetic compounds while encouraging grass fed and pasture raised animal proteins and fat consumption. Diet and lifestyle is your number one defense against disease and injury and should be corrected before using external treatments."
1,"This video would have been banned during Covid for promoting natural immunity.

And it's misinformation to say natural immunity is less than a vaccine. The CDC study on this shows natural immunity is stronger than a vaccine."
1,Pretty sure the thumbnail changed of this video
1,That part about your body using amino acids from your muscles to help rebuild the immune system because you’re not eating makes so much sense now because I always wondered why my muscles ached when sick

1,"There is a thought on your endcard: If Carbon Sequestration is viable, why don't we reroute some of the energy fossil fuel plants produce to do just that. Capture and store away the amount burned to CO2 as well as the amount released in obtaining the fuel and maybe a bit extra to make up for sins of the past.
This is wildly outside my field of expertise, anyone got some hard numbers on that? Like thermodynamic hard limits that must be observed?"

1,"My immune system is definitely unique. I have CVID (common variable immunodeficiency) and it’s quite rare. 1 in 25,000 people have it and my issue isn’t my white counts but my IGG levels and all fight off infections. I get IVIG every 4 weeks and IVIG is made from blood donors plasma and I’m on it for life. I’ve had both pneumonia vaccines but due to my CVID the pneumonia vaccines are not as effective as someone without CVID so I get pneumonia much more often than the average person. I’ve had pneumonia 3 times in the past 6 months and probably 15 times since February 2016. I’m also prone to sepsis which I’ve had 4 times with the first being nearly fatal and I had to be hospitalized for a month for that alone. I’ve been hospitalized so much it’s depressing with some years being admitted as often as 8 or 9 times per year. I’m supposed to be admitted for all fevers over 101.5 whereas healthy people only need to be admitted if they have something much more serious. GI infections are another issue that’s had me admitted for a week or so each. It’s awful. I’m fortunate to not have had COVID-19 though. I always wear a mask when out in public also."

So six months into that, my blood sugar suddenly goes ballistic....635. Next thing I know, I'm in the ER and they are bringing my glucose level down in a safe manner. Two days in the hospital and they tell me that my amped-up immune system attacked my pancreas. So now, I have Type 1 diabetes and am insulin dependent.....and still have the cancer.

1,Would HIV lower the damage from autoimmune diseases that is yet to come
1," this is a lie often the immunity from a vacinne is less than natural immunity..
I would ask for sources but this is such a ridiculous statement that it invalidates the entire credibility of the video.
A vacinne is create on a past version on the virus often the vacinne has not the full virus sequence, natural immunity reacts to ongoing mutations and exposed to the full protein squences."
1,"You stated that vaccines give better protection in the future than natural immunity?  According to The peer reviewed weekly medical journal The Lancet, study states  (Past SARS-CoV-2 infection protection against re-infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis) 
“Although protection from reinfection from all variants wanes over time, our analysis of the available data suggests that the level of protection afforded by previous infection is at least as high, if not higher than that provided by two-dose vaccination using high-quality mRNA vaccines,”"

1,"your choice of Covid as an example of vaccine effects was not ideal imo. There is a material difference of mRNA to ""traditional"" inactivated virus vaccines used in the past and there is a significant difference how our body's reacto to resparatory infections compared to other infections like measels.
There is more and more evidence that the mRNA's are not what we were told for now 3 years they were (just look into the studies around igG4's related to the mRNA's) and MMR and their vaccines would have been a better choice imo due to the much longer proven record of efficiency. 
I love your stuff and hope this is not taken as a political statement, just as a remark from a fan"
1,How come comment sections under videos like this are such cesspools?
1,"This video unfortunately did not give me any useful info on how to boost my immune system except for vaccines. I'm 100% sure they know about the benefits of the basics like healthy eating and regular excercise, which do a lot more useful things besides helping maintain a healthy immune system. But no, just vaccines. Good work otherwise thumbs_up_light_skin_tone"

Your body ONLY attacks invaders such as pathogens, viruses, bacteria, cells that shouldn’t be there. Foods other than fruit and vegetables FEED these pathogens which then excrete neurotoxins which make you chronically sick. 

Your body does NOT attack itself. 
Your immune system is NOT dangerous to you. Your body fights for you every single second of every single day. We don’t respect our bodies enough."

1,"Although vaccines can work, they are not as effective as doing it for real. Having the actual virus can help your body remember and fight it better."
1,"So, in order to become more resistant to disease, I have to take a vaccine for every type of illness? This is obviously not true, so, why does it feel like that was your solution? The answer is simple, you only gave us that one solution, while quickly glossing over the fact that our immune system learns. The correct answer is ironic, you need to get sick, to get stronger. Indeed sometimes an illness can kill you, but this is very rare for most diseases. For stronger illnesses yes, get a vaccine, but you can't do that with every disease. I thought the way you guys went about making this video very strange, and it seems like you guys made this video a covid-19 vaccine advertisement. That's not that bad, but it really just means you made a bad thumbnail, and dealt out lie, that is, the answer is always a vaccine."
1,After knowing the truth about the channel... i can't take these guys seriously anymore
1,"""Brought to you by Pfizer."""
0,"So basically when your sick, your immune system enslaves you to help with the sickness?? Pretty harsh.."
1,"You are 100% correct about the value of vaccines and their effectiveness is clearly evident in the reduction and near abolition of diseases like polio and measels.  That said, we have to keep the health value of vaccines separate from the monetary gain of corporations.  If we don't, we will end up with poorly functioning (if not down right dangerous) vaccines that are developed purely in the pursuit of profit rather than in the pursuit of eradication of disease.  COVID 19 is a perfect example of this; as more of the truth is slowly leaked out we are finding that way too many corners were cut and vaccination was pushed on populations that really didn't need it.  Now evidence is surfacing that it is causing cardiovascular damage that manifests differently in different demographics.  That is why it is so important that we keep money and politics out of scientific and medical development."
1,"All my life I've had a garbage immune system, caught everything, if it was going around I'd get it. Every flu season I'd be knocked out for a few weeks, and it only seemed to get harsher as time went on. My entire 20's was a period rife with illness, on two occasions even felt scarily close to actually dying. Often not getting a chance to even recover between bouts of some illness or another.

Then Covid happened. Suddenly, everyone was forced to be responsible with their shitty diseases, to be considerate (or at least forced to act it) of other people they're actively harming. I have never been healthier, I seem vastly better equipped to weather whatever comes to me. I haven't been properly ""sick"" since 2019, all thanks to a pandemic that forced the general population into good behaviour. I believe it was this grace period that allowed my immune system to fully recover after nearly 2 decades of constant abuse.

For this reason I react with fiery righteous contempt toward these various groups attempting to bring us back to the ""good old days"", where employers would strong arm staff back to work while sick, parents shirking their responsibilities onto schools, dipshits coming into the café visibly ill without a mask. These boomer-minded pseudo tough guys who baulk at the concept of community safety, espousing some antiquated bullshit notion of Darwinian survival of the fittest, or woefully simpleminded conservative bootstrappery.

To these people: you're scum, and the world would be better off without you in it. You're a blight."

1,"I think that Carbon offsetts are bs. As example, protecting a patch of rainforest does not capture a lot of CO2, same with trees that are cut down later. Captured CO2 needs to be stored somewhere, and isnt done at the moment at large scale. This is just Greenwashing. Investing in technologies that actually emit less CO2 does not only reduce your CO2, it does also encourage investors to invest into the development and production of the technology, making it more viable for a lot of people. To put them into scale, you can give the Carbon saving a monetary value (something like 200$/metric Ton). If something saves 3 ton of CO2, this would equate to 600$ per Year its allowed to cost more than the alternative."
1," this was one of the bigger concerns with long term Covid cases, even when they were mild. 
Continuous scarring of organ tissue is potentially quite concerning to long term health, and can take quite a long time to recover from.
Get your vaccines folks, they save lives and make symptoms much more mild."
1,So that's why my lungs feel like crap!! I have a buncha holes in them I guess... okay bye.
1,Do you still sell the Immune book or no
1,"Good thing we now have lots of data showing how efficient out body gets from different kinds of vaccines, eradicating smallpox yet doing very little to corona, where natural dojo is now the safer course, a pity that the promizing rna vaccines are so specific that they become inefficient against mutations, where normal vaccines made from weakened or dead virus is teaching our immune system much more, making it way more effiecient with fewer sideeffects, maybe in the future rna vaccines will be better and cause less organ damage too, nicely illustrated in this video :)"

1,"Maybe your worst video to date. Misleading title and just some pharmaceutical industry propaganda. It's embarrassing, especially for you guys, to put the COVID ""vaccine"" in the same box as the other vaccines that took years of work and research to put out. You discredit all the videos you put out by making these sell-out pieces."
1,Was the covid vaccine proven to be a true copy of the virus?
1,I'm in the comment section to bully the weak link of humanity: the anti-vax/conspiracy-junky mold.
1,One video we was a planet now we're a country what happened to us how did we get smaller
1,Was that monkey eating a virus face_with_tears_of_joy
1,"I was going into this video expecting a holistic answer. What I got was ""get the jab."" I understand the importance of vaccines, and the details of the immuno-response system were very informative, but I was left a bit disappointed."
1,Gene therapy not a vaccine....
1,"""brought to you by Pfizer"""
2,I highly recommend getting the Immune book he wrote. Very interesting and a good read
1,"I always get an Immune system video when am sick, it's such a coincidence. Was sick some months ago , got a video then. Sick now, got a video. Thanks Kurzgesagt.heart_suit"
1,"Yes, but why don’t u mention the fact that Covid-19 and a lot of other diseases are human made and against them in this ducking capitalist inhumane system, we human beings don’t have the natural immune defence mechanism. Is it soo ducking good to be sponsored by the billionaires which don’t give a ducking shtttt about us the human beings?! Kurzgesagt das ist nicht gut und das ist soo unmenschlich!"
1,"i almost died getting the covid vaccine, i would for sure have died if it was the real natural thing."
2,This is what best science education material look like. Kurzgesagt is the best thing that’s happened to YouTube.
1,"I was recently very sad that these awesome educational youtube channels got compraritively few views and subs that other, but I was so wrong as this video had 29,000 views and 3,900 likes just 14 minutes after being posted."
0,look! the propaganda machine churning more of its usual billionaire funded bullshit
1,I thought it was common knowledge that most elderly people died and young healthy people were the ones that easily beat it. Not vice versa
1,"Not going to lie. But I haven't had a flu shot for at least 5 years now, and refuse to get the covid vaccine. So knowing that me not getting the flu shot to where I can possibly die from the flu makes me very happy."
1,will the body do something if u have xylazine?
1,"This channel was amazing... when the subjects were cosmos and space related contents. I appreciate being on the pay book of the B&M Gates foundation is a lot more remunerative, but please you are being obscene now..."

2,thanks
1,"now, this video has released 15 minutes ago, so we probably have to wait for the downvotes and comments by anti vaxxers claiming that this is some form of propaganda to control the people"
1,I’ve been watching this channel since undergrad. Now I’m graduated and a dr and it impresses me even more how well you all are able to present such complex topics in an easily understandable way.
1,"Not enough people taking vaccines into their body, eh? People starting to not care about COVID anymore? My God the propaganda in this video is plentiful and blatant, they hide it less and less with each passing day. *""Hey guys, don't let nature take its course, instead give us all your money and let us control your body and lives!""* Don't fall for it people, your immune system is just fine the way it is."
1,"Seemed weird that the second half of your video was just thinly veiled ""X good, X never bad, always consoom X"".

Would have seemed way less shilly, had you counterpointed with ""sometimes things go wrong, like with the dengue vaccine, but overall. This medical technique has saved billions since it's introduction in Y year"".  You undermine your own credibility when the full picture is ignored, for fear of people misinterpreting that picture."
1,"Funny, I watch this whrn it came out and now I'm back with a cold :-: the book is cool tho!"
1,"""No scars, no permanent damage""? At this oint there are tons of studies, which connect mRNA-injections to myo- and pericarditis and these often leave scars on the heart. No need to oversimplify this important point."
1,"The immune system is a jerk, this is very relatable to us millions that are battling long COVID."
1," Why, exactly, is there a monkey eating the oversized Influenza Virus? What were the Artist's intensions with that metaphor?"
1,Man this guy became a huge vacc pusher after covid. Hope he had a video also on how dangerous a rushed vaccine without testing can be. Also how useless some are
1," ""You're Slippin' Jimmy! And Slippin' Jimmy I can handle just fine, but Slippin' Jimmy with a neutrophil is like a chimp with a machine gun!"""
0,Worst video on the Internet
1,One big add  if someone told me show me a very big add i would show them kurzgesagt video
1,why almost everytime he changed the title for example: the old title is called “the immune system is more dangerous than you think”
1,So what will happen when you get a cut( like 2 in. Long cut) on the back of your neck. Like my son did 2 days ago.
1,"Oh, look, another vid made by kurzgesagt that transports a narrative of their sponsors. Yea, of course, boost your immunsystem. And guess what, its by vaccines. How funny that kurzgesagt is mainly sponsored  by whom? By these fckerss that are producing and are involved in the production in pharmacies. And besides, many of their vids are pure propaganda. It always looks like kurzgesagt is somekind of cute, little, idependent yt - channel, isnt it?! No, its not! Kurzgesagt is a media channel sponsored by lobbyists, industrials and interest groups that have their own agenda. Its NOT editorial independent. Its a very very subtile propaganda channel.
So ppl, just dont trust this b.s. that they are spreading."
1,we have the resources to make sustainable fuel from  emissions in the atmosphere but choose not to because it requires a high amount of energy and then the  epa would lose power. since they cant have that they never bring that very simple solution to light.
1,what is technical and medical measurement to look exactly about how much scar our internal organs have in percentage to the total?
1,"If it’s like this 
I’VE FOUGHT AN ENTIRE WORLD WAR
3 weeks i could not move, my brother or my dad usually help me like a wounded getting carried by his arms to the bathroom, eating  was a big pain , after this war my breathing for some reason became more faster"
1,"I think it's sad that Kurzgesagt only talks about vaccines.. here u can see that they're sponsored by some parties.. I would have liked that they talk about vitamines and micros, exercise and other immune system boosts.. you can train your immune system every single day.. I still love kurzgesagt but this was not their best.."
1,"When I was little I had all sorts of crazy old illnesses- scarlet fever, measles, smallpox. My immune system was really strong and I didn’t get sick (except for the occasional allergies) for nearly a decade until now. I’m currently on day 8 of having the flu grinning_face_with_sweat"
1,"My immune system seems to be strong. For couple years I wasn't sick.
When I donated my blood and they took 450 ml they told me that I should be careful now, go back home and eat something. Instead I was able to walk to my friend's house in temperature approximately 30°C. I had to walk about 1,5 km. Then I went to my home 3 km away. Nothing happened to me that day and I was feeling fine.
My friend blacked out after they took 20 ml for tests xd"
1,the immune system is like a 40k warhammer but in real life
1,I could have sworn the thumbnail changed.
1,"Posted the day after the bombshell report that previous COVID infections are more advantageous to your health than COVID Vaccinations.

Bill Gates’ Propaganda channel you ain’t slick."
1,"The fact that they hide their subject (vaccination) so dramatically until the last third of the video shows you how terrible public perception has become for something so essential and basic. It's quite troublesome. Corona not only fucked our economy, our health, and our society - it also enabled populists to fuck up trust in one of the major instruments for our own survival."
2,How do you do this animation also your vids are great
1,I really wanna see a video about smoking effects on immune system when bacterias enter the body.
1,"Your videos are very nice, but some apps that you are showing us to download, is not possible to download in my country and I don't why? I'm from Lithuania Lithuania"
1,"Now that it's been confirmed that natural immunity is superior to the ""vaccine"" are you going to make a video on that whole scam?"
1,I wish this channel still meant something more than billionaire propaganda. It's sad to know this channel isn't what you think it is.
1,I wonder how much cash carbon brokers siphon out of the system?
1,"As a type 1 diabetic, I concur."
1,Crazy chimp with a machine gun
1,Hello still havent gotten the calendar that I ordered over 5 months ago haha and no reply on my emails. But your vids are cool tho
1,This video is 2 years late.
1,BRO i clicked at the kurzgesagt notification so fast
1,was this sponsored by one of the major big pharmas that you work for?
1,I think the most insane part about this is that almost all of the information in this video was discovered in the past 100-200 years
2,I would love to play a mobile game with Kurzgesagt graphics!
0,"silly question:
if you have an autoimmune disease, are you more likely to get sick  or less?
like, if the immune system is so bored it starts attacking the own body, then may as well be productive and fight off an actual threat, does it work like that?"
1,"Oh boy. I saw the headline that we're hurtling toward a 1.5 degree C increase in global temps and there's nothing we can do to stop it. Weirdly coincidental that bit about Wren there at the end. 

I foresee the time where we get our last Kurzgesagt video and it's about how we're facing the end and it's not all bad."
1,lol Sponsored by Pfizer..
1,I LOVE this. To any antivaxx simpletons that had to watch 2/3rds of the video before you let on victory_hand
1,"Cool video, very informative & everything but there were too many war references. As a Ukrainian I don't need constant reminders, I can literally go outside or open up the news feed in any social media."
1,"Just curious, why the thumbnail and title change?"
1,"As a researcher in pharma, working on vaccines and who contributed to COVID vaccines research 2 years ago, I strongly disagree with 2 statements you gave.
1. Based on our today's perspective, you shouldn't have taken the COVID vaccine as an example for the ""dojo"" metaphor, as it proved to be highly inefficient and with very crippling adverse effects (sometimes yet rarely lethal).
2. Saying that vaccine immunity is better than natural one is completely false. Vaccines exist in different categories you can display as a spectrum, whereas some vaccines are in a really close form as the natural pathogen (e.g., deactivated virus), but giving strong symptoms; while other vaccines are in more segmented forms (e.g., virus fragments) giving less symptoms. This spectrum is an equilibrium: you want to give the fewest symptoms to the patient possible, but the more segmented is your vaccine, the less immune response you'll get. Indeed, you have adjuvants to boost it, however, it won't get an immune response as high as a natural one, and also, some adjuvants may cause side effects crippling as well (e.g., squaline that causes narcolepsy to some eastern-Europe populations, permanently). Nevertheless, a vaccine is a useful tool for what has been told in this video. However, stating the immune response is higher is false.

I usually find your video filled with quality content, but tbh, this one looks like propaganda and seems dishonest to me on the vaccine part. And no, I'm not an antivaxxer.

Sorry if some wordings I used were wrong, I'm not an English native. Please don't blame me for that aspect. For the rest, I'll gladly debate with you smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes"
1,Imagine that even your own immune system doesn't want you
1,"Question: If getting a bruise or cut, gives us a scar which is our body’s way of cementing rather than replacing the bruise with new and strong cells then how do work outs work, what happens during muscular hypertrophy and strength trainings?? (Would really appreciate a video if possible)

PS: Love your work & merchandise"
1,vaccines are great until your forced to take it to go to school and then you still have chronic chest pain for 16 months since getting it.
1,My first vaccination against covid (I received the 2 dose version) I only had a sore arm. The second vaccination I felt weak and exhausted and had pain in my neck and arm. I also got the booster with no major effects except a slightly sore arm.
1,"I can say I can no longer take vaccines because they are built on dairy proteins and I have immune attacks from dairy products and I suspect it is because my immune system misread the protein as the vaccines dead cells of the diseases.
I wonder if I am alone with this or are there others because I  had this tested and when dairy is added, the immune system or white blood cells attacks cells that absorb the proteins."
1,"Mm yeah, after the covid vaccine i'm not getting another one for a while.."
1,I’ve had COVID 4 times I’m done for
2,What Doesn't Kill You Will Make You a Killer
1,Please do a video about allergy
1,"would cutting around scars in lungs, heart, or skin trigger the rebuilding of those tissues? like if I cut a bit of a scar off and then let it regrow is there a chance that it could be replaced with the correct cells instead of those collagen fibers?"
1, Bocchi the Cell!
1,This feels like nazi propaganda... telling us what we all know is true to be false and vice versa.
1,Very convenient this video was released after that guy admitted that Pfizer were looking for ways to make covid more deadly so people would have to get more vaccines...

1,"Please make a video about our need to sleep, the cause, the outcome, and the mysteries of dreams. Also, if there is a way to survive without sleeping and enjoy the lost third of our lives. Yes, I'm just typing this because I'm sleepy..."
1,This video gives me great reason to unfollow your channel. How much did you get paid to promote vaccines after all the development? Do you call that science? Bye bye!
1,"Natural immunity to the alpha strain reduced chance of infection from beta strain by 13X. 

Natural immunity is superior when it comes to viral diseases which mutate too fast for any engineering process to keep ahead of."
1,Ever since finding out that kurzgesagt is lobbied by bill gates I can’t look at these videos the same way
1,I found out you guys shill for Bill gates and it ruined my whole experience
1,This is a cool theory. Somebody should test it someday.
1,A shame a lot of viewers here watch Kurzgesagt to learn things without looking at other sources or understanding that sponsored information is always twisted.
1,Anti vaccers are crying right now

1,Why are these characters fat?
1,"I get it's not the point of the video, but you brought it up. Individually what doesn't kill you makes you stronger isn't true, sure. To the gene pool however it very much is. As a species we survived the black death, because it culled those susceptible genes out of the pool. Those people didn't breed and the population was stronger for it. It's a harsh reality. That mechanism, that evolution, no longer exists for us. Modern medicine has short circuited that process. Modern medicine may be the solution to that problem as well, but if it isn't we will be a weaker species in the future for it. Our humanity may be our ultimate demise."

1," imagine believing we have that huge of an impact on ""climate change"" when nature can just spawn a volcano that can emit toxic gases in the atmosphere in 1 month than we did combined since modern times with all our pollution. none of the climate doomsday predictions from 100 years till present day materialized. it's just scare tactics and in the words of george carlin, mother earth probably created humans so they can make plastic for it to gobble. the hubris and arrogance of the modern human to think it's existence is so impactful is just funny and sad."

Eating unprocessed, natural, healthy foods while getting regular excessive can decrease your chances of dying to illnesses drastically, I mean just by not being obese you are 40% less likely to contract covid when exposed to it. The fact that 41.9% of adults in America are obese and you didn’t even clarify this in your video, only focusing on vaccines despite the covid vaccines being very controversial due to the shady nature of Phzier and the censorship of information on lobbying ect.  and also   16.0% of female participants reporting LTAEs which were mainly fatigue, menstrual disturbances, myalgia, arthralgia, dizziness, and headaches, is just shocking and seems misinformative to be putting this out."

1,lol you would have to live for thousands of years before (normal) scars on your organs would even get anywhere near to affecting your life
1,There's other ways to boost your immune system other than vaccines. The fact you didn't touch on any of those makes me think big pharma is funding this channel.
1,"This sounds like ""Dr Fauci goes to the elementary school"" book I'm reading."
1,"You say “vaccines “ but don’t use the “MRNA” qualifier. 

Why don’t you use your cleverosity and tell us how great an idea it is to become a spike protein factory?"
0,"I rarely get sick but when I do, it’s like world war 3."
1,"""Imagine crazy aggressive chimps with machine guns"" I'd rather not, thanks.

Measles is particularly nasty because it decreases existing immunity for other diseases"
1,"Hey, can you please tell me what application do you use to make these animations"
1,"I’ve been exposed to it a few times, and never got sick, I think I’m immune to COVID"
1,Sell out
1,My immune system has gone rouge and is currently breaking down the melanin in my skin.
1,Not all vaccines work in that way
1,", no, don't eat that, silly ape^^"
1,The amount of positivity in a kuzcajshsywho video makes me sick
0,"The disease I was born with didn’t kill me, so it made me weaker instead of stronger, now I am weaker than the average human for the rest of my life"
2,I love this channel so much i swear
1,mrna covid vaccines are infective aganist transmission and prevention. also they have serious side effects
0,Propaganda detected.
1,Crazy aggressive chimps with a machine gun rolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughing this has to be the best analogy you guys ever made
1,"Just because logically ""vaccine dojo"" is harsher on your system then ""nature dojo"" doesn't mean that we should go around assuming every vaccine is less dangerous then the real equivalent for every subset of people.
The testing data from all the trial runs of vaccines should be public data for example, so that we can look and verify that is it actually less dangerous. Instead of just assuming through logic that it's probly less dangerous.

It's also useful if we want to say compare which vaccine we choose to get. For example comparing pfizer vs moderna vs covid."
1,"i got sick 2 times in a month and this is so irritating and i m still sick while texting this comment so please find a solution for me
































thank you"
1,12 beers a day and I managed to beat my of all diseases for 5 years face_with_tears_of_joy even Covid being around sick ppl I guess really my organs are so bad that even viruses can’t survive face_with_tears_of_joy
1,We all know your channel is owned by bill gates
1,"Doc: You had a heart attack Mr. Simpson.
Homer: Well whatever doesn't kill me only makes me stronger right?
Doc: ehhehe. Oh on the contrary. It has made you as weak as baby.
*slap* *slap*"
1,I believe what doesn't kill you only makes you...stranger
1,Watching this with COVID feels appropriate
1,You're a shill for untested mRNA and Bill Gates. You will be exposed
1,"I'm sorry but, healthy young people died from covid? I'm sure in rare cases this was true where those people had underlying conditions. But this was not true overall."
1,Get some mRNA to fix the stupid balance
1,the graph glitches at 
2,Would love to see how we can empower ourselves and strengthen our immune response through exercise! That'd be a great video
1,Bill Gates. Go away!
1,Healthy people did not die from covid. They were never healthy.
1,Michael Parenti would be proud of the analogy
1,What is the music called because the music is FIREsmiling_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,There is a lot of misinformation in here
0,Why is it as I just finished off my sickness this pops up
1,One more insecurity activated clown_face
1,hey Kurzgesagt! What is the difference between a hair and a ligament/connective tissue/collagen in general? And why has removing the ligaments from my face caused my adult teeth to start to regrow?
1,"mRNA vaccines are so different from traditional ones, since mRNA turns your own previously healthy cells into the actual vaccine material, causing your immune response to kill your own cells in your lymphatic system, pancreas, and liver. mRNA is much easier and cheaper to manufacture, so it's great we had that when the pandemic hit us unprepared. But now it's just medical corporations wanting to profit as efficiently as possible. We need to switch back to traditional vaccines now that we have more time to do it the right way."
1,big fan of the freckled main lady for this one
1,"Kinda weird how I just got sick and don't know why and this just dropped, a cool and smart coincidence I may add"
1,"The dislikes are from basement dweller anti vaccine conspiracy theorists. 
And as we learned, their opinions are invalid."
1,High quality and easy to understand! I'll show this to my family once it gets uploaded in spanish!
1,"Kurzgesagt videos are so high quality, it’s more than worth the wait! 
(It also probably prevented me from failing my latest bio test grinning_face_with_sweat)"
1,"This went from bad to worse so fast that I stopped watching. This channel has really sold out, such deceitful deception you now provide. All beware."
1,"i had a super strong response against covid, i had uncommon symptoms and everything, 1 night rest and all that was left was slight fatigue and a mildly ticklish throat that went away within a week"
0,Why is the body in this video overweight.
1,"IgA N is a common result of immune system turning in your or causing unintended collateral damage permanently none stop after just getting any viral flus. We might think colds and flus are no big deal, but truly each time you get them, you are literally shaving off your life and risking permanent disease/health conditions or flat out high life risk regardless of age nor health"
1,Every video I watch I am still in awe of the animation and attention to detail. Keep up the great work!
1,Please address what a CARRIER is and how infected individuals can spread disease and be symptom free!
1,"""This program was brought to you by Pfizer"""
1,"More often then not, our body's immune system tries to put out firest fires by carpetbombing the forest in order to blow out the flames."
1,This guy will one day switch my career from lawyer to biologist.
1,One thing you forgot Government does not help you are guaranteed Or any adverse reactions from the vaccine So if you have blood clots and die You cannot sue government  It does not take responsibility That's why I'm against boast of that scene's polio im for
1,I literally say all the time that if what doesn't kill you makes you stronger is true then tell that to Polio survivors.  I had a teacher in fifth grade with leg braces that he got when he was younger because he had polio.  Antivaxxers scare me because of their vehement determination that it will do more harm than good.
1,"This is propaganda bulls**t, What's the real reason they want us to get vaccinated, They failed with the corona vaccine, They probably created nano tracking bots or other nano devices."
1,I wonder if choosing this art style was a tough decision.
1,"I was a fan up till you said ""vaccines"" are better than natural immunity.  And now you lost a viewer/subscriber. Just spreading fake news for your government overlords."
1,"Excellent presentation of how a real vaccine works. Please make a video also on how the mRNA products work, and show why they are not vaccines. Thank you."
1,"What an incredible nutshell version of this topic. This is truly incredible. Wonderful, wonderful job. Congrats all of you involved in this! Thank you for trying to educate the world and make it a better place."
1,It's funny how they changed the definition of a vaccine. It used to prevent a disease now its defined as it should slow it
1,I like the animation work on this channel. And the scientific information provided to the audience. However its strange that the majority of topics favour in one way or another Bill and Melinda Gates foundation...
1,Every immune system become Among us moai
1,OMG all this video is just to say that the way of boosting your immune system is to take a vaccine. FGS!
1,"Emphasizing fear and risk and damage, and downplaying the opposing perspective, bending the truth, ignoring details, all as a way to push vaccines in the current context—not the most honest video. 
That dishonesty activates reactance in anti-vaxxers and creates the very problem you think you’re helping."
1,Anti-vaxxers would say otherwise.
1,"The UN listed Ageing as a disease.
What are kurgzgezats' opinions?"
1," Thought you could sneak in a Better Call Saul reference without us noticing, eh? Not so fast Kurzgesagt!"
1,"I rarely get ill and I had all kind of viruses when I was younger, in the 80s and 90s was exposed to a lot!"
1,"The propaganda behind this video is disgusting. Speaking about vaccines in such a influenced way is so noticeable, and nowadays, with the huge amounts of evidence against COVID vaccines, naming them as a ""better option"" is at least, irresponsible. But well... we are all here to make money afterwards.... right? nice jobs getting that check guys"
1,">Funded by Gates Foundation
>Exaggerates Covid's lethality
>Presents a black and white fallacy implying your only two options are getting a vaccine or getting the disease
>Glosses over the potentially dangerous and lethal side-effects of vaccines, both short and long term
>Zero mention of how exercise and healthy dieting drastically boost your immune system

How anyone can watch this channel without having even a hint of skepticism or mistrust is beyond me."
1,would getting symptoms from a vaccine show that your body is responding well to it? (assuming it's not allergies)
1,When the cytokines look sus
1,"Funny you keep mentioning the covid vaccine, since it's not a standard vaccine and it's been deemed a bioweapon."
1,My Brain just opened a whole new area when I discovered this channel even more than School ever did
0,Well stong responded is also dangerous the cytokine strom is caused a lot of dead
1,"Vaccines developed against super deadly diseases that have been studied for years and are backed by long-term data? Yes!
Vaccines developed against a disease that is most likely harmless to me, without enough data regarding long-term side effects and with profit as the top driving factor? No!"
1,"just want to let ya know that God loves you all, we have to turn from sin and repent before it’s we too late, John 14:6 says “I’m the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the father except through me”folded_hands_medium_skin_tonewhite_heart"
1,"So who sponsored this one, big pharma or just carbon offsetting companies?"
1,Today the Wall Street Journal has an exclusive on the coronavirus being caused by a lab leak in Wuhan. Many people were already cancelled and censored (including many doctors) for speculating about this and even right now some of you are getting angry about this news. All I can say to those people is that you have blood on your hands now but thankfully: facts dont care about your feelings.
1,I really loved the way you teached abou the immune system. And you're now posting 2-3 videos per month. GREAT!
1,Can you do a video on the differences between traditional vaccines and mRNA vaccines like the one for Covid?
1,Please new video about nanotechnology
1,"Another serious question.....We know that immunity is carried over to offspring's.
In the past, humanity had no ""Vaccine Dojo"" people only had ""Nature Dojo"".
So the logical question here: Would a Vaccine dojo immunity be carried over to the next generation?
If not, than the vaccine dojo is better for the individual but much worse for human kind. 
I am not an anti-vaccer, i just want to hear some logical explanation on that point. Thanks. My guess is that there are no sufficient studies."
2,"Lol, make that game real!"
1,"Ah dang, I've been smoking marijuana since I was twelve face_with_open_mouth

I'm in my forties now and I hope I live to be 247!"
2,May god bless humanity green_heartfrom israel
1,I bet all the thumbs down are anti vaxer plebs
1," is why females live longer than males on average during food scarcity, because on average we have more body fat than muscle mass, and muscle mass needs more calories to maintain, whereas body fat can be used as a source of calories by the body in emergencies"
1,Seems true for vaccines that have a lot of history behind them.
1,"I have an idea for a future video. You remember your video on terraforming Venus, the part about the mass driver? What if we had a mass driver that linked the world's continents together to bring intercontinental travel times down to a few minutes? It may be possible to make it safe for humans to travel on."
1,"nearly 20% of this video is given over to the sponsor. Wow. Capitalist infection right there. But you're right: the body is weaker afterwards...Hope it buys that Munich schloss you so crave, Phillip"
1, thanks for throwing that unnecessary shade smiling_face_with_tear
1,UWU is that a disease? *releases cytokines*
1,its a shame when they make a virus in a lab to make this certain virus more damaging and more prone to stick to human cells...
1,"After reading your book immune this is a lot easier to understand. and inspired me to study immunology. Thank you

also, please keep up the work."
1,This is why the anti-vax movement is dangerous. Tin foil hat huggers putting their kids lives at risk.
0,Yeh!  War is too expensive
1,you know who developed a convenient vaccine??? YAY! Bill Gateessss!!! let’s go get vaccinated am I right?!! Great marketing tool as always Bill.
1,This would of been handy in 2020
1,The monkey holds something different every video
1,I heard vaccines can actually sometimes make your immunity worse due to it being unnaturally injected into you rather than catching it how you normally would ! Not sure if that’s true for everyone I’m sure it depends on the person

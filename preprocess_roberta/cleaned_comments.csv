"Been a long ass time since I uploaded on this channel, I know. Even though I've been uploading on the second channel, I missed you guys over here. loudly_crying_face

Roadmap: https://neetcode.io/roadmap
Quiz feature: https://neetcode.io/practice
Second channel: https://youtube.com/@neetcodeio"
There is a whole science of passing interviews. Not doing the job. Passing the interviews. Shouldn't this be telling? I'm fed up with this bs being kept alive by SOME tech companies. (I'm a senior software engineer at a big tech company)
"I have solved 65 Leetcode exercises + about 50 from Hackerrank (which are uglier and not as satisfiying as Leetcode's). My nightmare was DP problems, I considered dynamic programming the toughest topic until I ""found the trick"". I had to solve lots of DP problems before starting to see patterns and common ways to solve these kind of problems.  
I cannot imagine solving 569 Leetcode exercises! Even with that amount of solved problems, I wouldn't feel prepared enough. 

PD: Check the book ""Dynamic Programming for Coding Interviews"" if you consider DP your nemesis as well!"
"You know Pepe the Frog has been co-opted by racists, don’t you? I can’t watch your videos anymore because can only assume you must be part of the alt-right."
"Imagine what you would have been able to build spending that amount of time and enthusiasm on a real application development or real research.

I mean ok you are a successful YouTuber, so for you it was probably worth it."
"This got me hyped! That roadmap at  instantly reminded me of a skill tree from RPG games that I want to max out. I started coding 1,5 months ago with CS50X, and using gaming analogies when learning to code changes everything for me! Instant dopamine triggerface_exhaling Never tried Leetcode before but it reminds me of XP farmingface_with_tears_of_joy"
Looks like you are in mental hospital after all these lletcode problems)
pov i can't solve it straight out of the bat and go to solutions
"Hi! I've a question, could we do the LeetCode exercises for instance in VS Code and later on move the solution to LeetCode or is it a must to be solved at LeetCode page since it's similar to real job interviews? I'd would be quite grateful if someone could answer"
"Burst balloons is an MCM variant and its not that hard, trust me, if you're a beginner give a whole day to understand MCM 
and the next day you will able to do these  4 hard problems.
1.BURST BALLOONS
2.SCRAMBLE STRING
3.MIN COST TO MERGE THE STONES
4.MIN COST TO CUT THE STICK."
"That's inspiring .... but did you ever look at the solutions? (i sometimes do, when my solution finally passes, however it is only within the lower 15% of performers)"
When am I ready to get started on leetcode? Can I start just knowing nothing at all?
"This video is giving me hope and a strategy, thank you!!"
"I've taken Data Structures and Algorithms I, but now I want to start getting ready for DS&A II. I don't want to forget what I've learned, so I think this is going to be a great way to apply what I was taught. I will be updating in three months to see how my progress is going. Siri is going to remind me every three months from now.
# 3 weeks in I feel way more comfortable with arrays and making objects."
I’m using js and Python were should I start ?
This video convinced me to start doing Leetcode problems at some point. Thanks
"I want to become an expert in C++ I refuse to use python to solve leetcode problems, I will use C++"
"i m exactly like you where you was in the part of solving medium question i just can't figure out the trick for the first time, and exactly like you i solve 100 question until this time."
"You said 50 leetcode problems helped you get an internship at a bank, but how? Once you have developed some mastery of these problems, how do you market such traits to potential employers?"
What are you using to whiteboard the problems?
"I use C++ in Leetcode. I started leetcode to learn C++ better at the beginning of my first semester at university. So far, I've solved 378 leetcode problems in timespan of 4 weeks. Nothing I encountered was challenging enough. I'm planning to give up, should I? I've been programming since I was 8, so I've done all sorts of things. Perhaps I'll eventually face something difficult in leetcode but I may just do it for my cv."
"Just think about the amount of time this person burned solving brain teasers. If hiring were actually normal in this industry, we would reward developers spending this time building useful apps that others can use. Think about the net gain for the world, if we rewarding developers for spending time building practical applications, as opposed to worthless brain teasers. 

The title of this video makes me feel ill."
How to pay from Russia?
I thank you from the bottom of heart :)
CS = BS
"After watching your video, I decide to quit my job and spend a year in solving leetcode problems, learning AI!!!"
Neet code was a side project that changed people’s livesssss
"One of the best from information perspective video on YouTube.(Well, for programmers)"
Thanks for sharing with your experience!
1 video to solve them all
"Leetcode doesnt teach sht, seriously if you want tp be good at coding as soon as possible learn how to write readable code or mastering oop."
If Java is my language of choice then have I failed before even starting? I've heard coding rounds at Google expect you to solve at least Two LC level medium problems within 45 mins with syntactical correctness... Without an IDE. So languages like python have an inherent advantage here.
do 500+ algorithms and then goto google and work on an api. what a waste of talent.
Liked and subbed just cause I’m so grateful for All ur hard work!
A lot of strong (grandmaster level and higher) people on codeforces say that you should solve the problems randomly
Dickstras is crazy. Love that algorithm
"Looking at that roadmap, this seems incredibly useful, how have I not run into something similar?"
"One thing I'd add about language choice is that picking a language without built-in data structures in the standard library makes it impossible to solve certain questions optimally without literally needing to implement the data structures yourself. For this reason, I moved from TypeScript to Python for this kind of question...!"
The leetcode roadmap comming in clutch TYTY
"I always feel like doing leetcode questions on the spot is defently a skill that requires you to maintain doing it. You can learn how to solve lots of em and recognize sort of what structures and algos should be helpful but nailing a problem quickly on an interview in like 20 mins of less requires you to keep praticing it regulary. Which feels like a giant time thief for creativity that could be spent on doing more meaningful things as at the end of the day, its mostly about being able to memorize a lot of things."
"Neetcode, what Leetcode problems have you used in your actual work?"
"this was very inspiring, thank you :)"
is leetocde even still relevant with chatgpt churning out answers immediately?
i don’t even know how to code why am i here
I'm doing that same thing right now! You're a huge inspiration to me and a ton of other people! I'm almost to my first 100 done!
"The python code for reverse string is literally a one line code face_with_tears_of_joy

print(list(""Hello world"")[::-1])"
"Hey bro, leetcode is something boring, you should try doing 1000 hard problems on CF."
" ""Don't waste too time"""
I am not sure how leetcode cannot be considered useful. You are solving problems. I write code everyday and I solve problems for work. yes you also need to make projects for your portfolio to showcase so do both.
"while True:
      print(""thumbs_up"")"
"True, leetcode won't teach you everything. That's why Neetcode is here"
"Watching this video as an unemployed person, hopefully I will be at Google in 2 years"
"“Don’t waste too much time solving problems”

Don’t mind me spending 4 days doing research and studying one topic before I attempt to solve. I mean how can I solve without knowing the process? Am I doing something wrong lol"
"I want to share..
I know the basics of javascript but I don't know how to solve all of those in leetcode pleading_facepleading_facepleading_face
How do they come up with a solution? pleading_facepleading_facepleading_face"
"What knowledge do I need to apply for a software engineer job at Google, Facebook, amazon, apple, etc"
Switched to Python :'(
now should i use python or go with c ?
That was the smoothest plug at the end I've ever seen face_with_tears_of_joy clapping_hands_medium-dark_skin_tone Also 5 years from now AI will write this kind of complex code for you man_shrugging_medium-dark_skin_tone
"can I leetcode in Javascript and PHP, plz someone answers me"
why i cant save this video
"I'm 14 years old, i like machine learning and i started programming 2 years ago, but didn't focus on learning common algorithms and data structures ,actully i wanna participate at IOI, so i started competetive programming, my dream is to study at MIT, can anyone help me and give me what should i do?(i'm also now training on math olympiads for IMO)"
"Shoulda done them in x86 assembly for some brownie points

...I mean they can't reject what they don't understand, can they???"
"so, what happened to your brain?"
What the app you use for drawing on screen?
"God bless such a generous hardworkers like you, dude."
"Much love bro, nice vid by the way =))"
"Thank you so kindly much for the roadmap. Your sacrifice is not in vain, you will go down in history next to names like Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, and God."
Where can I get that image at  for my wallpaper?
"Leetcode is not about how smart you are. Is about how desperate and obedient you are.  Unnecessarily going through 500 leetcode exercises out of fear of not been enough, will likely make you reconsider leaving your job once you land it, helping you employer to reduce the employee turnover rate. Problem they had in the first place because of how poorly they treat people, making them quit in 1.5 years on average."
"Some of those hard problems are like multi-week projects that require deep research into some niche computer science subject. I've never seen an interview in real life that isn't solvable by an slightly above-average engineer in 45 minutes. It's also designed to be done solo, whereas in an interview you have the interviewer guiding you. I definitely found that after you get the basics down, it's pointless to try to do this. Do personal projects instead, way more realistic practice and much better use of your time. (Good) companies will try to test your ability to work on something that might actually pop up in your job, not some random dynamic programming BS that you would just Google if you ever encountered it IRL.

Also even if you're a rockstar problem solver on Leetcode, you still need to have communication skills and your code needs to be clean and concise in the interview, Leetcode doesn't teach any of that. As an interviewer, if you write hacky garbage, I'm much less likely to pass you even if it works perfectly than if you write great code but don't get a 100% functional solution."
Great!
"where u code at (web) ?
i need to learn coding but idk where to start"
"in essence... give yourself the answer! For gods sake... pioneering is left for the ones are discovering actual undiscovered territories, just catch up if you want to do that."
what would you recommend for Application development?
ChatGPT can solve them all
"You are a Godsend! If there is anybody out there who deserves that damn Google offer, Sir, that is you! <3"
"I can do all the technical questions no problem, but I just can't human under interview pressure."
Quick question--how much do you worry about programming time? I always fuss over easy problems because I want to submit the most efficient solution.
this video should be made standard for all 1st year cs students in the world
"I love my verbose af Java! Definitely slower in solving problems but I enjoy the language, my data structures and algorithms class actually uses Java lol"
"Real question though, without a CS Degree how do you even get your first interview for your first job"
"This man is doing god's work. After having done this grind sucessfully before, I am revisiting the same 75-90 question grind  now and I was struggling more than I have before. But the video states everything so honestly. Its baking in these concepts and patterns again and again. I really needed this today. Thanks man!"
"""python is the shortest language"" me looking at hes comparison the only difference being the lack of brackets"
Can you make a roadmap for data science to solve problems? grinning_face_with_sweat
. Wrong. Quantity is the way to Quality.
More leetcode done less opportunity of new solution you can found crying_face everyone stick to the “correct answer”
"Everyone who reads this, we don't know each other and probably never will but I wish you all the best in life and all the luck in the world two_hearts."
"Maybe title the video - amazing tips for leetcode interviews and problems?? 

Video title seemed kinda self indulgent but content of the video is great, conversationally explained and super helpful"
Bro solved so many problems that he became google itself
"hey man , i want you to know that i respect you for what you do! free roadmap is the best! i'm currently preparing for code interview in quite a big tech russian company. and the ""obvious"" thought that you've mentioned that solving order matters is actually not that obvious for me. thank you for that thought! (in fact , less than a month left for the upcoming interview and i'm not sure that i'm gonna pass it, but who knows grinning_face_with_big_eyes)   if you're reading this comment i wish you luck and easy interview problems)))))"
"I'm at about 100 problems, mediums seem to vary a lot in difficulty, easy problems are trivial, hard problems are impossible though"
"i appreciate you doing this video.  currently im too burnt out on programming to learn more stuff, but it's helpful to know there's some seemingly easy thing i can do to make more money should i decide to go back."
"so funny, i knew all of that when i was 15, and even more of alghorytms"
oh I thought he was going to do a fMRI before and after.
This is noteworthy fore sure!
Thank you for your website
"That's so cool , by the way you bring back my motivation , tnx dude"
"i recommend anyone to take a course in computer science basics if they are interested in leetcode, harvard's cs50 is a good choice

especially if you are unfamiliar with linkedlist, hashmap, tree, binary search, etc."
going straight into DP problems makes you wanna backtrack which makes you an expert at backtracking so you're good to go
Thank you so much. It's really help
Great effort to create a review section for the questions. Massive respect.. This guy is an absolute legend for sharing these “real” tips .
Very precious content ! Thank you with my whole world
ok you are my new hero now. after watching your video I got so motivated to crack leetcode!! thanks a lot sir keep up the good work
Your brain become LGBT? Holy fuck.
I'd love to combine the idea of the multiple choice to spaced repetition using something like anki
Great video your content is super helpful and informative. Please consider using another word to describe exceptionally challenging leetcode problems.
"The fast review section is a game changer. If and when  it's finished for all the 433 questions  you have (prefereably in order , finishing blind 65 then 150 then the rest), it will be so much help to get a quick revision during the last few days of an interview."
type cringe channel name
bro has hashmaps in  his basicsskull
"should i solve every problem in a single list and then move on to the next one? or start with the easy ones of every topic and then medium...?
(for example do i solve all 9 problems on arrays and hashing and then go to 2 pointers?)"
C++>>C>>javascript>>java>>python caz everything in python is a pointer to an address in memory
can u please make a video on how did u got intenship? nd how can i when i knows Data structures and algorithms bt have not done much development stuff? Its imp sir please consider
"lol ""academic"" solutions are those who are correct and fully understood at least, since the problem is generally solved on paper first and then turned into code. Not like ""add this hack, add that hack, to circumvent a bug in this scenario"""
"folded_hands I personally would like to thank you for your service Sir.  nerd_faceYou are doing a great job by giving such a valuable knowledge globe_showing_Americas for free to people who are willing to learn. person_getting_massage I have visited your website.

Click bait
Im I the only one shocked at the list of basics including trees and hashmaps? I may be a beginner but I feel insulted to the face
"Great work, u are amazing! Keep being who you are"
"you are 100 percent right 
I am building application and web app for companies on freelance platform but i dont know what is actually leatcode :D"
you should make a video on python only covering those topics which are required for dsa
"God may bless you for everything, the video, your experience, the page of neetcode, really I appreciate this"
"""There's no shame in looking at a solution, as long as you can understand exactly why it works."" - NeetCode TS: "
Kind of disappointing; I was expecting you to literally have brain scans pre- vs. post-Leetcode.
What's name this program?
Thanks a lot... I had similar thoughts and an inkling that I am going in the wrong direction when I am trying to solve everything on my own. Because one medium level problem If I am lucky is going to take whole day. Now I think it is important to understand the solutions behind each rather than solving every problem on my own
The motivation i neededred_heart
The fact that we have to learn all that to get a job and then forget it if you don't practice for a year or two since you won't be using any of that anyway is mindblowing.
"Thanks a lot Navdeep for the website. I still can't believe the practice section is free of cost, the fast reviews are literally what ed-tech websites charge money for, I've faced almost similar quizzes in interviews and thanks to you I'm motivated to finish DSA/Leetcode otherwise I might've given up on it. Thanks for being so generous for the community may god bless you with more gifts in life. You deserve everything you've got and are still getting man."
"I feel somewhat new to coding now because so far I have managed to only know about binary search, linear search and few sorting algorithms. I don't know what trees or hashes means either damn. I did build websites and Web apps but this just feels there's alot to dive in."
"This video was honestly not much about ""your brain"" doing leetcode problem."
" to 

3sum - 4sum - DP

Am I on the right platform here eyes"
Are there any free ressources that explains every categories in the Roadmap?
"Cool, but rarely useful for web devs."
I have been looking for something like the Leetcode MC quiz for a long time for reviewing. Simply amazing :) Thank you.
Holy shit you are a legend
"One thing I totally agree in this video is never feel shame for checking answer. Some methods may invent by multiple people in few months or years, why do you think you can figure it out from scratch in one day or afternoon? And you would definitely encounter them more than once if you feel lack of practice."
"Leetcode is used as a tool to enter the tech cult like buying a kergen water system. There isn't a point to it. There are better ways to test for problem solving skills, but if you want to join the freaky cult, leetcode it is."
i can solve like 2-3 or even 4 medium in an hour but still i am never confident regarding my coding skills( and microsoft is arriving for intership  interview in 2 weeks and im still not confident)
"Great video! But I've a question, is problem solving really just pattern recognition? If so, then what you proposed, by doing and seeing a lot of different problems, will create sets of patterns in the brain, and when you see similar problems in the future, you're able to connect the dots. But then, does it mean that we shouldn't ""waste time"" in trying to solve hard problems on our own, and instead read up on them and understand it so you're able to use it in the future. So are there any real benefits trying to solve extremely tough problems on your own? And how long should one attempt the problem before deciding to look up the solution and understand it instead?"
I've been doing web development for almost a decade. I don't even know if I can solve a simple sorting problem.
The hardest part is going to the solution after 45 mins. I always feel like I'm so close and my ego won't let me and it ends up taking another 2 hours
"I am in 6 grinning_face_with_sweat
I want to try"
Google USA?? WHAT role?
"is it worth it to grind leetcode or build subdomain specific knowledge (like blockchain, ai, security)"
I love this guy. Love you Neet! Anyways  imma go solve 100 problems for fun and learn red_heartred_heartred_heart
thanks
I appreciate your content man. Absolutely god tier stuff red_heartred_heart
"Just find your road map, its a big helper for us newbie, thanks alot for sharing!"
"Bro, I have started this Leetcode journey with your course. I hope one day I will be good enough to get a decent job. Thanks, you are really an inspiration."
your problem solving skills and your logics are simply extraordinary and easy to understand. Huge respect to u bro and make more videos
Would you recommend leetcode over codewars?
This whole video was just an advertisement for Taro. What a waste of time
"The roadmap is an amazing resource, thank you"
"Thank you for making this , now I have a better idea how to approach this"
A much needed video
broh. not a loser. XD
I solved 1 leetcode  problem. I guess Tim Cook can retire soon
"Hi NeetCode!
What kind of app do you you when you draw something in explaining a problem?"
"Where is the Taro links, thank you bro, you're amazing"
"Using Java is ok for solving problems, I was initially use Python for Problem Solving"
I did CS Degree and solved about 110 problems bavk then but now as i have my own company (doing IT projects) i think if you have what you learnt in the course and applied even half of it then it would be just enough for anyone to get past 110 and maybe even 300 which was my decided end point.
"I really hate Leetcode problems, most of them are aimed towards CS students who are good at maths and difficult data structures and algos."
"Bro you're a legend!!!, thank you so much."
"I want to start learning coding and I feel confident enough in my creativity that if I learn one I can start making my own projects just fine, but trying to solve problems that I may come across while creating is what I really want to learn. So seeing this video showing me where to direct my attention and how to properly learn this skill is a big help."
Not me who got an internship without learning Data structures and Algorithms
ser do you ever find yoursel telling you that the easy question is hard or am i just dumb??
im glad i get to use Swift in my interviews
I can understand how to solve the question but it takes time for me to actually write the code....
soo the whole video was an ad for taro 
Bro do you know about the neet examination in india ?
"I never did any leetcode problems, fortunately I've still gotten internships and part time positions regardless. Doing leetcode will probably help your critical thinking and make you solve algorithmical problems easier, but coding is far beyond just that."
 Rolling window problem
You should mention/disclose that there’s a sponsorship/ad in this video.
I still can't understand Burst Balloon.
how many years does it take for solving 569 ques ? :(
"""Each of their nodes"" is a singular noun phrase. Each of your nodes contains all those numbers.
Singularity is the very essence of ""eachness."" It emphasises every one of the things it points to. Get it?"
"This may be a good question for you, 
Earths orbit is not circular around the sun, so, it falls toward and away from the sun as it goes around, for how much distance does the earth have a gravity vector from the sun that is perfectly normal to the earths velocity vector? (either end of the orbit is ok<Periapsis or apoapsis>) lets assume the sun and the earth are perfectly spherical."
" You showed bfs for DFS and dfs for BFS. winking_face

"Strangest people are those that solve all those LeetCode problems to get into Google, thinking it will be like a ""dream job"" of sorts. News flash - it isn't. I got hired as L6, Staff Engineer and left after few moths to other company - Google is WAY past it's prime - it's not the company that people wanted to get into 10 years ago. It's full of tragic code, extremally slow pipelines and strange kind of ""talent"" - people that somehow confuse what engineering work is really about. 

My recommendation - stop watching ""leet code"" videos or solve those abstract problems - start solving real problems, in the real world - because this is what EVERY business is built around."
"Where's the link for taro, bruv?"
where can i find the 150 leetcode problems list?
" being a successful coder is kind of essential to be a successful scientist in my very personal view. And also, a scholar.

"Hi, is this site is good for newbi in Python?"
I couldnt even do the first problem

"Yesterday June 7 2023, I started learning DSA, and I'm glad I found you! I'm working now in your NeetCode 150, thanks bro!"
You're the best man!
How long did it take you
"Big problem here is focusing so much on ""FAANG"" the  term is so wack and the idea behind it is stupid. Just look for a job that seems interesting. I haven't done a single code interview ever since I started looking at jobs that seemed fun and I actually wanted to do, not because they'd pay a lot."
"Funny how is at the bottom iin that roadmap XD it all boils down to, math is hard. Fucking hate DP tho"
i went to university and take computer science thinking that it was for real not gonna be hard but they remove algorithms which is supposed to be a base for us and every assignment is like kinda crazy we need to code connect4 and and even connectk which really broke me lol i really wished i learn before i took on the degree
"Hi, today I went to your roadmap and found that my progress wasn't there. Is there any possible reason to it?"
OK that sucked.
You must be a twitch staff or jucier... pauseChamp ...
bros brain turned rgb
Awesome! thanks a lot man
"""Oh that's the trick"" - The bane of my existence."
"Heyy. You said you switched from C++ to Python. Was it worth it? I also code in cpp and was thinking of switching. I have solved a total of 30-35 problems, so I am not that deep into leetcode yet. I will have interviews starting after 2 months. What do you suggest? Thank you."
"Thanks for the good summary! Now is the perfect time to start buying stocks and crypto( BTC, ETH,) if you are just being introduced.. I really wish I started earlier. I’m learning this doesn’t have to be as complicated as some people make it out to be. Thanks to Jeannie Harrington Program for helping me get into her trading server and investing guidelines. Investing and trading are more than just having TA skills. There is a big component of discipline and emotional maturity, that one has to work on! Time in the market vs. timing the market. If you keep that mentality as an investor,  you will stay calm during the storm! Within some months I was making a lot more money and have continued on that same path with Jeannie."
Haven't paid a visit to leetcode for a month college is draining me grinning_face_with_sweat
"Really glad I came across this video, thank you for all your tips and advises. Your platform is insanely usefulthumbs_up"
"So, what happened to your brain? :)"
Thank you for the roadmap so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Dont worry, the programmers are literally TRYING to ruin my brain at this point, so youre not alone"
by tumbnail he turned brain in a rgb light pinched_fingers. He's a gay guy now.
"I think leetcode is a good use of time in general too because it re-programs how you think and hones out your mental edge. I've only been seriously preparing for a short time and I feel that I can approach things more analytically than before.

That is always an invaluable skill in development because when the difference between a test passing or failing in your MR is a mis-handled edge case the leetcode part of your mind should help take over and figure out what's wrong.

Love your site and videos, really well explained in a global economy where millions of people can code but few can explain it well, and even fewer can do so in fluent English with relatable abstractions to understand the approach."
So..what does this have to do with your brain and the picture you have?
" eating my lunch and... ""phhhhh!"" Got it out of my mouth!! Trees are a CATEGORY of Graphs! No the other way round. Although, I don't know whether is more convenient to learn from the specific to the general concept."
oh shiiii but I'm in the middle of java i don't want to start all over again for python although I'm planning to learn python because of the new Mojo lang that is easy and fast but learning them consequentially can make my brain a spaghetti.
it is so unbelievably fucking stupid that we have this barrier for entry to jobs. no other industry is like this where there is a gating mechanism that is utterly irrelevant to the job content.
Most of the time I get stuck trying to understand what they want me to do lol
"Actually Im on 2nd semester of IT, we do have BST's, graphs,  dynamic programming etc. Maybe university not so bad after all."
"This is an inspiring video, I really appreciate how you explain things in your videos, keep up the good work"
"Writing DFS, BFS as easily as if it was a for loop?! Well, I have got a long way to go."
Can i use leetcode without any prior programmig experience?
"Unbelievable. I have never had such a short video change my outlook on something so dramatically. You earned my immediate like and sub, keep doing what you are doing!!!"
"Ah, GeeksforGeeks, a man of quality."
"I have absolutely zero experience or knowledge when it comes to coding or software development, how to do I even get to the point where I am able to understand or attempt easy Leetcode problems?"
"Thats the problem, I am not stable, sometimes I can solve hard problems very quick, but sometimes stuck in an easy one for an hour...crying_face"
Nice add introduction!
Brain mush indeed
What a load of crap.
the one time i wanna look at a sponsor and they forget to put it in the description
"Thank you so much for the roadmap!!
It's helping me focus on a goal"
"As a person with several thousand problems solved over several online judges, let me tell you're _horribly wrong_. There is no such thing as ""diminishing returns"" in competitive programming. Every problem you solve makes you faster. Given the gap between you and people on top of the list is 20 or so orders of magnitude, you'd prefer to become as fast as possible, and then even faster.

TLDR: choose the complexity level that you're barely able (but able!) to solve, and keep solving. Aim for 2000+ problems solved, that's where it becomes useful to you on a daily basis."
"i was almost give up on this, but you changed my mind, NG is hard in this year, and i only have B grade, no intern, its graduate-unemployed. thanks you and your work i might going to try again, if i did you you are NO1 i need to thanks"
"greatly explained, same thing was told by an interviewer with over 1000+ leet code problems solved."
"Was looking for information to work at Google, randomly found this channel, wow. I knew I need to work on algorithms but didn’t have a good path, like roadmap, and it looked like a too complex and long way, I was struggling to learn steadily.
Your roadmap made it look so much more achievable. Have 2.5 more years in college, I’ll work and make it, hope I can tell you good result."
"You're godsent for software engineer preparation, after watching few of your neetcode explanations it helped me understand many stuff which I might've not learnt elsewhere and you also helped me find the confidence to solve any problem, kudos to you man!"
I solved 99 problems but a bitch ain't one (((
The thumbnail makes it look you did an MRI scan before and after doing 569 leetcode problems
am i the only one who actually finds these problems really fun to figure out?
this video is dope bro. How long it take you to solve 100 problems.
Small and BIG difference between good developer and nobegood developer.
And then you get the job and then you'll never ever need all these algorithms again...
"Amazing video, I really needed this!"

Wow wonderful content
so give ai the concept of how these are done and we're all out of a job WOOT!

Very Informative video. Thanks man red_heart
you are excellent and  you are genius man keep it up for more leetcode maang series problem that you havegrinning_face_with_sweat
"Trust me after i saw the employees of google istanbul office, i realized they just ask those questions to make you look like dumb. In fact when i visited their office i saw, none of them literally none of them know how to code or solve problems. So don't waste your time with leetcode etc learn real stuff it is better and yeah google is sinking without a trace nowadays because of their lack of tech knowledge to solve the problem of massive spam (which is a combination of domain generating-keyword scraping-redirecting-hiding-trends scraping-copying and spinning the content with chatgpt etc.. which is done by russians, ukranians and indians automatically for bet websites etc..) and of course the power of chatgpt."
"My thoughts as someone who's in a similar AC range and found this channel helpful when starting out:

First off: Wild to think that my AC count is higher than yours at this point; the channel was an immense help when I was starting out mid-last-year, and I'll admit that my count is only as high as it was due to feverish prep before going into finals with 2Sig and JS.

For what it's worth, this is coming from someone who did not target FAANG due to bad timing with interviewing (late 2022) and ended up landing in trading:

Personally, I think that the point where you can consistently do 99% of problems is a bit higher than 250; I'd say that was around the 300-350 mark for me. There are some concepts that I feel are hard to get down pat until you've done then several times. Additionally, in my experience, some concepts seem like they have a habit of just not coming up as frequently (prefix sum) as others (dfs/bfs), so your chances to identify and practices them are a lot lower. They're not even necessarily hard, but if you're not used to them, they can be a pain in the rear.

In terms of preparedness for tech interviews, I think it depends greatly on the company. If I were to go back and do them again now, I'd feel 95% prepared, with that 5% being due to a certain company snidely asking information theory questions (I won't say who but if you know you know). However, if I were to interview for like IBM, JPMC, BOA, etc. (and likely FAANG's not known for asking DP), I can honestly say I'd feel very confident if I had to do it tomorrow with no dedicated prep time. The interview difficulties aren't consistent, and if you interview with enough companies, you'll find that out pretty easily. It's the gap between doing a pretty straightforward sorting problem versus being asked to use bit manipulation in your OA; it's not that you're less prepared overall, but rather that you're less prepared for a specific  type of interview.

As far as whether solving LC is worth it past that 250-300 mark, I think it depends on your targets. If you're looking for FAANG, 250-300 is acceptable. Non-FAANG F500's you can probably get away with like 200. If you're trying to do trading firms, you need to get to that 10-15 minutes for an LC medium point, which I'd say is around the 450 mark; it's not so much that you need the algorithm knowledge, since that isn't changing much, but you need to be able to look at a problem and in 20-30 seconds know ""Oh this is a UF problem"" , ""This is two heaps"", ""This is graph traversal with XYZ optimization""."
I don't know why is the run time distribution is presented in (milliseconds) not in asymptotic notation?
"Can you teach me how to make YouTube videos like yours?
Thanks"
Hi. I wanted to let you know that the problem number 22 on leetcode named generate parentheses is not a stack problem. You just did it in a really inefficient way that forces the use of a stack. just wanted to let you know because its in your  stack questions on the roadmap
It's just life saving Channel and website. I am taking preparation and got this channel. Thank you very much Neetcode.
"Hey if I want to learn a programming language to solve these type of problems what the best language to start, I have some experience as I already learned but  forgot everything these few years. So if I start again should start practising c++ or python. Which would be helpful for joining companies in India."
"I love you man, Thank you <3"
 who dis dickstra
"Well, I never really took Leetcode seriously, but why not, time to get in that daily practice. I'll aim to do 1-4 per day.

1 to make me at least do one a day, and 4 to encourage me, but not get overexcited, as every once in a while, I'm sure I'll come across a few problems that take at most 5 minutes to solve"
Thanks)
Codeforces is much better than Leetcode.
"For several years of programming, I had practically no such problems. Most of the problems are struggling with libraries, frameworks, dependencies and architecture or something like the programming language is not suitable for one part of application. At least in the area of programming that I deal with... Apart from the need for intellectual development, of course, I see no point in practicing solving such problems."
This is the longest advertisement I have ever seen. Watch till the end you'll know what I mean.
"Graph theory called, with edges and nodes,
A network of paths and cycles to decode.
In traversing the vertices, they'd find their way,
A journey through graphs, come what may.

Data structures beckoned with stacks and queues,
Organizing knowledge in ways to amuse.
Trees and heaps, they'd learn to arrange,
Balancing the data, as requirements change.

Algorithms they'd craft, with care and precision,
Optimizing solutions with logic and vision.
From sorting to searching, they'd conquer them all,
Mathematical prowess standing tall.

- GPT 4"
"nice video, but that graph at  is horrible xD"
You explain things so well that I forget how much work you put in to get where you are today.  This kind of videos reminds me of that.   Thank you.

Man I could kiss you
I remember spending so many horus doing LeetCode only to find out that the interviews on the companies I wanted (triple A game studios like ubisoft) literally have nothing to do with regular tech companies. I'm considering going back into it so that I maybe shift out of game dev and go back into regular programming
Excellent intro video. I love it. I have taken the notes. 謝謝分享啊~
Math majors typically start somewhere in the bottom right and work left and upward and then backtrack to backtracking to gain mastery after really linking their math skills with how to express complex mathematics programmatically by 4th year. Grad school is always great!
"Awesome to see how your channel grew, I've been watching you since 50k subs"
"Wow, this video is quite insightful! It's great to hear about the journey of solving LeetCode problems and eventually landing a job at Google. I can relate to the struggle of starting with easy questions and gradually progressing to more complex ones. The advice on choosing the right programming language, like Python for its conciseness, is something I'll keep in mind. Also, the importance of understanding the order in which to solve problems based on different algorithms and data structures is a valuable lesson. I appreciate the creator's effort to provide a roadmap to help others avoid similar mistakes. The tip about not spending excessive time on a single problem and being open to looking at solutions is refreshing. It's reassuring to know that solving one or two problems consistently each day is more beneficial than cramming. The creator's approach of explaining the thought process behind each problem is commendable and time-saving. I'm intrigued by the idea of turning LeetCode problems into multiple-choice quizzes for efficient review. Overall, this video emphasizes the value of LeetCode in developing problem-solving skills and highlights the importance of continuous learning in the tech industry."
"For the suggested problems under the videos in your DSA courses, do they cover all of Neetcode 150?"
I am in a plan like solving atleast one or two leetcode questions a day.. I am completely a beginner at leetcode and just started it before 8 days.. I am not able to solve most of the question..I solved around 15 problems so far and 12 were of watching others solution.. I dont know whether i am in a correct path..Can anyone say me whether am I doing it wright? Like for watching others solution and coding it..Can anyone help me out?
"""dont waste too time"""
This is the computer science job equivalent of in maths cramming for exam.

"Is it necessary for a data science fresher to learn and solve problems in leetcode?.
Because, as a fresher to the data science field from a mechanical engineering background, I found difficult to solve problems on leetcode."
Often shorter code means language has built in more features

Time to rethink our strategies. Low oevel code will be most likely made obsolete by AI in the foreseeable future.
"I’m an accounting and finance major however programming or coding in general fascinates me a ton. The idea of being able to create stuff, the challenge and needing to adapt excites me.

But I have never been advised to learn this sort of thing, algorithms. and nobody ever questioned me about it during my interviews. I genuinly want to ask why? like, what types of jobs require you to do this sort of thing. ( Of course i can imagine that you need math like this to program some crazy NASA shit. but like, where do you use this stuff in normal jobs? )"

Good video but the tech influencer trend is becoming toxic. Too many LC monkeys that just don't get the big picture but people will do anything for a decent pay day out of school. Wouldn't recommend this if you have a family or a life outside of work.

"Yet 0 companies doing big O notation on their 3-rd party systems that they rely on but asking us to todo in algorithms)))) so funny to see when some big dog goes down and suddenly 50% of companies are stuck or can't release. Imagine docker io goes down for a week. Ahahahahahah nightmare for d*gops)

Still yet doing forms or other corpo cr**p as far as this algos needed only in game industry)) if you think that by solving 500+ leetcode problems you became smarter, in terms of real experience it's 1-2% as far as you need to know when to apply))

Offer from google now is nothing basically. So make your own analysis guys, then just trust all this youtube things.. because they do it to sell c**p that you don't need to make sure they will be rich. This is how it works everywhere, tech industry is not immutable from ""coca-cola"" thing or other marketing.. b**t, they just represented in tech or frameworks that you even don't need to solve your problem."

"Don't solve them to get a job, get acutal practical skills with technologies these companies use day to day. I got a leetcode question in interview and I refused to solve it, I asked them how many times per year they need to solve this, they said none is just for to test your knowledge. I said why don't you give a story that you do day to day, then you can clearly see if I can start work from day one or I just memorized few algo's to get a job and have no practical coding skills you ACTUALLY need. They were stunned, but said alright, gave real story medium difficulty, I coded in an hour. 

They gave me job on the spot, even accepted when I went over their budget. Because REAL value of programmer is business value they bring.

Valuable Advices. Thanks.
" yes, there is no need to reinvent the wheel when the solution is already out there. and thats why asians look so damn good at learning. no, we just grinded past papers and the problem database

"Hi Neetcode! (Neetcode Premium User) can you make videos on software engineering best practices/ technical concepts that is applicable in the industry? like git commands, databases, operating system, APIs, etc? Just concepts that software engineers (entry level at least) should know. If you release any of that, we'd greatly appreciate it! :)"
"I think the 45-60min limit per problem is important, it's happened to me on freecodecamp while doing the JS courses and it's something that is hard for me to apply because I really want to solve problems before looking into the solution.
But some problems as you advance, they become more vaguely explained, with less and less detail and more complex, which can be difficult sometimes to come up with a solution, by the time you read the solution you realize that you'd probably would have never come up with anything remotely close to that so yeah, putting a time limit, looking at the solution and trying to understand it is hopefully good advice."

"It was a really interesting video!
Still want to talk about experiences about Quantity > Quality.

Sheffield university, University of Pennsylvania, University of California.

They made study examples where 2 groups of student had to take pictures.
A Group had to take a picture every day.
B Group was independant.

The photos were then evaluated in terms of quality, creativity and composition by a panel of independent judges. The results showed that the group that took the photos significantly improved their photography skills compared to the control group.

We often tend to see certain things as useless when we reach a certain level, even though they have allowed us to reach our current evolution. This is not necessarily true for everyone, but I thought it was interesting to share what I had read in comments!"

"good job man, i aspire to be like you. keep soaring your dreams, the sky is the limit."
"I will leave one little story here, as it relates to this video. If you are someone that feels like you are not smart enough to succeed, then this story is for you. 

I was one of the worst students back in my middle school. I remember being the only one not able to understand stuff in math class that basically everyone understood. The teacher even pulled me aside to talk to me. Failing lots of tests, from multiple subjects... even though I studied a decent amount of time... Eventually, I realized I needed to increase my intelligence. This is different from getting good grades. This is about increasing your comprehension, creativity and brainpower. I thought that math problems, not those from school, were the path. So I started at them. I started easy, getting the easiest math olympiad problems I could find. Some are really easy, but even those took me lots of time reading the solutions to understand.

But eventually, these started to actually become understandable to me... so I started ramping up the difficulty... I spent hours and hours everyday solving these problems, and eventually reached IMO level (International Mathematical Olympiad - though I did not make it to the actual team, I was selected as one of the potential participants, but basically everyone on the team selection tests were at least bronze level). I also became one of the top students from my country, and also a National Math and Informatics Olympic medalist. I studied for free at the top school, by getting the highest markings on the scholarship competition. It took a few years of daily study, but patience is a huge monster skill to have. Your brain just takes time to build itself. You wouldn't think of rushing a broken arm, right? 

Afterwards I got scouted by a top investment bank... at their best trading desk. Got the top score on their logic test by a mile. But this is getting out of topic.

What I want to teach with this story of mine is that even if you are not too smart now, you can become a top tier intellectual being by sheer effort, unless maybe if you have a special condition. But in general, if you do this, solve lots of math problems, ramping up difficulty until you reach international level, you WILL become a supreme genius. Every one of the math champions that I met worked very hard to reach that level. All of them entered top schools, top jobs, etc. 

It really is a matter of putting in the hours... I did maybe 2 or 3 hours of math solving everyday, some days on vacation from school I did 4, 6 or 10 hours... It is a lot of work, but I guess most of the great rewards come from hard, grueling work. And mind you, I was in middle/high school.

Some practical tips: get easy problems first, and try to learn one per day until you get the habit. Note that I used ""learn"" instead of ""solve"". Focus on raising your understanding, not on immediately being a top solver. Try all your obvious ideas first, and if that does not work, than start a timer for 15 minutes. Think for 15 minutes, searching for new ideas. Then read part of the solution, and try to finish the rest. Keep doing it until you get the entire solution.
Also, try to understand how you could have reached that solution. How did the guy who solved it think about such an esoteric idea? You need to ponder these kinds of things, to increase your intuition. Sketch a lot. You need pen and paper. Read how the top math champions came to be and read their tips.

Hope this helps someone, and also that I did not come off as arrogant. It is hard to talk about these experiences without causing the impression of ""showing off"" or something like that. But I also believe it may help someone. I for sure would have liked to read these words back in the day. Would have sped up my progress.

If you feel you do not have a future, please believe that you can have a great life. I know it seems hopeless sometimes, but our comprehension gets limited when attacked by extreme stress and sadness. Work hard, have patience, it takes a few years, but if you put in the effort on the right things, you will most probably achieve ""success"". Though by then your definition of success will probably be different.

A child with a ChatGPT subscription will solve it faster than you eventually"
 This was something I needed to hear. I have spent way too much time bashing my head against problems that I am getting nowhere with. Thank you.
"you forgot to mention that in 99% of the problems you face, you can like write a solution that will actually solve the problem 100% in most cases but just fails in time/space complexity which let's be honest aren't important that much nowadays (to a certain degree)."
Did you use chatgpt?face_with_tears_of_joy
thank u so much for the video and I did sign up ur website thx slightly_smiling_face
ok show me your brain on EEG
non-ironically love you bro
What is the drawing tool he's using?
"Thank you so muchred_heart from India. I am preparing for job and have crossed 108 questions and only yesterday I was wondering for how long should I stick to save problem and you answered this.
I just want to know that even after crossing 100 problems still I need to see the solution for problem whose underlying concept I know
so am I on right track?"
there is a bug in your website plz check
"thanks for the leetcode problems list, great website!"
Now u r gay congratulations party_popper
Helps a lot red_heart
"What if solving LeetCode problems just for pleasure and fun?
Is there a problem with me smiling_face_with_tear"
"Great video.

I've been studying for the past few months. And I identify in most of the things you say and you put into words others I only had in my mind. 

In my experience and from what you said I highlight:

- Order matters.
- 1 or 2 daily is better than tons a day.
- Repetition, feel free to do easy or mid or hard ones again even if you solve them in the last few months.
- Look and understand other's answers."
"I needed this video so bad, your just a living legend for us ! Love you!"
Bro you are awesome.
thanks bro
I agree on Burst Balloon being a crackhead problem !!
"As a competitive programmer its so funny seeing how different the concerns of leetcode people are. ""Writing binary search like it was a for loop"" for example feels do much like a basic requirement to me that it feels weird"
I have solved more than 700 leetcode problems in the span of 3 years. I've never even got a chance to be interviewed at anything. Sucks to be a third-worlder.

Where can I find the second Youtube channel?
"solid adivices, however I disagreed with some of your point. First, the number of solved problems should not be prioritized, but the amount of knowledge you learn. Second, do NOT look at editorials/tutorial after 5 minutes, please. You will get some sense that you got smarter after reading the edits, but trust me you don't."
This is an amazing channel!
Whish is the site you are using to practice for solve problems in this video explain
"""Dickstra's""? 
[sus rock face]"
thumbs up to this dude
The quiz review idea is awesome! Any idea on how long you think you’ll have the quiz ready for the Blind 75? (Approximately)
"Sir, can you share Neetcode 150 as a leetcode list?
I already solve about 200 problems and want to check my progress. Thanks!
p.s. It will be great to also include the no. of problem in your roadmap table to quickly check if I have already done it!"
"Hi, thank you for this video, I really enjoyed it. Could you give some advice on the process of actually getting an interview in the first place? thank you!"
"You are a literal legend, and will go down in the history books as being more directly responsible for people getting their dream jobs than any other programming channel. I salute you sir saluting_face"
"Thank you so much for your work! You made my interview preparation process so organized and even hard problems easy to come up with.
And btw the newly added quiz idea is brilliant!"
Thank you for road map! it will help me a lot
"Amazing, thank you"
"The value per minute of this video is unreal.
That roadmap is absolutely killer."
"First of all, let me express my gratitude for the valuable content that you have provided. I have a question that may seem trivial, but it is still significant to me.

My coding journey started in 2018 when I began teaching myself without having a CS degree. I started with Python, and then progressed to web development, where I learned Django. Currently, I work as a freelance developer. Although I have considered learning DS/ALGO and applying to big tech companies, my self-doubt and uncertainty have held me back from applying. Recently, I have started practicing Leetcode problems, and while I can solve easy ones, some medium ones take a long time to solve, and hard ones seem impossible.

My question is: Can an individual over 30 years old, without a degree, join FAANG or MAANG companies? I would greatly appreciate your insights on this matter."
"When it comes to timing yourself while practicing Leetcode, what would you recommend as a time limit: 45 minutes for each problem, or 20 minutes? Right now I do 20 minutes per problem, and spend the rest of the hour understanding the solution."
This mans is doing God's work with his site. Thank you!
I promise as soon as I get unemployed I will spend my time solving leetcode problems. Sadly or luckily in my country the demand for programmers is so high I will never be unemployed.
"This is the best video I've seen regarding coding preparation.
I also started doing ""random LeetCode"" (well, the most freq asked questions at Google interviews according to LeetCode). After a year and a half I learnt about Blind 75 and Grind 75. Then now after 2 years I found this video with your roadmap graph with the order you should learn topics on. I wished I had seen this earlier as I'm sure patterns would've stack faster in my head!

Thank you for doing these videos and the leetcode solutions, your contributions to the community are invaluable!"
As a java user i can agree that it's hard to must accept the language i use is verbose
 can you make a video about development and building applications?
"Which language do you use during coding interviews Python, Java or C++?"
C++ is the first language you learned damnexploding_head
Fast review feature is awesome. Please add more questions to review. smiling_face_with_heart-eyes
"Thank you, Roadmap is awesome. I've been looking for this kind of aggregation of problems."
"Bro your website is lit fire
Thank you so much thumbs_up"
"8 Days Ago Ive started #365days of solving leet code problems (at least one a day)
And Im not following a plan actually, so that could be handy to follow your roadmap, also its not really clear because Im a computer science student having a bit of knowledge on some advanced topics, but havent tried it practically, so its a little bit confusing where to start"
Thats dude.
my boi getting sponsors now... congrats man! you're doing god's work
great job with the roadmap concept! helpful to build framework.
"I'm at 303 problems solved and I feel like I haven't mastered any pattern and that's because I've never organised or structured my learning I kept on jumping from pattern to pattern without actually mastering the previous one, this video showed me all of the mistakes I've made but know I'm feeling down because of all the months I wasted and how I hindered my learning curve"
"You conclude how leetcode helps you reasoning about unit testing without argumentation, how do you figure leetcode helps people unit testing? Aside of this question I believe things like leetcode are a good addition for practise, but is it really overemphasised by big, mostly American, companies for the mere fact that it's much easier to test on applicants than more abstract concepts."
"so c++ or javascript or python

i started with python."
THANKS!
Learning a coding is like learning any other foreign language. You need to study codes first before you learn to code yourself.
"my friend has done much more than you, shame on you"
and how is backtracking done after trees? skull
can someone without a Maths or CS degree learn algorithms?
The review list is insanely smart and useful. Thanks!
"I am happy that neetcode got sponsored and also that it is Rahul's company, I used to learn android development from him"
I switched to python but now it seems I’ve gotten slower.  Hopefully I’ll get faster as the language conventions become more second nature to me
You’re doing a great job and keep it up thumbs_up
bro unliked his own masterpiece.
The video pattern looks like Fireship's. Anyways nice video
"Thanks man your videos are such help, especially in middle where you explain your approach, I rarely watch full video in one go becoz after watching your explanation I try to solve and then go through code. Keep coding."
"Besides the great insight about solving leecode problems, may I know how do you find those interesting meme gif pictures showed in the video? Really enlightening xd"
"I'm putting every problem I solve in Anki, to help the reviewing process."
I think mostly those are a big time waster unless you’re interested in those problems.
where is the roadmap
Love you neetcode. Roadmap is fire
I solved 250 plus problem still here nobody cares cause I haven't done btech or any bigger degree it sucks
You are THE BEST!heart_suit
"I used to fumble around various user posted solutions on LC, trying to find the one which I could easily understand. Then I found NeetCode."
Awesome job dude! I'm next winking_face
 this pronunciation hurt me
Lol yeah no thanks. I would never want to waste my life away just to try to get into a FAANG company. Those companies will drain your soul. Companies using these types of questions for interviews are what's wrong with the industry. I pity and feel bad for the kids who  base their life around trying to get a job at FAANG.
it's called leetcode not basiccode
"I don't if it's I working in the energy sector or like in Germany but in all my job interviews I never had to solve any coding problems. Of course they asked questions about how I my approaching style or how I would solve something in general. But like I said, I never had to solve a generic ""puzzle"" thinking_face

But I see the values of solving those and do it from time to time on Code Wars"
LC is such a waste of time. Imagine using that time to learn and make REAL projects. Industries need to move on from this.
"I'm at 100 problems. What you're saying right now is really resonating with me. I used to feel the same way, hopeless and wanting to quit when I started and couldn't solve even easy questions, now easy questions are pretty okay for me. I hope the road gets easier just like you mentioned here. Thanks for this video. This is exactly what I needed."
Thanks brosmiling_face_with_tear you are the reason I am able to solve some coding question hope to complete all your questions
Man switch to NextJS 13
Maybe I am just weird but... I really don't care about making it to Meta or Google...
@Neetcode please show your face one day
Oh shit didn't even see the quizes on the site lol
Now go solve some real-world problems instead of bragging about yourself. It turns out every person on this planet who thinks they are smart aren't as smart as they think they are.
"Bro, when can we expect the front end course in the neet code course program"
"Guys, I'm a new grad working as a SE for a small startup. I'm planning on learning some ML skills hopping to jump into a ML job by the end of the year. Do ML engineers also need to have some good skills with leetcode problems?
How do you think AI will impact these kind of hiring processes?"
"Now that GPT can solve leetcode problems, I wonder what the future holds.."
That quiz methodology for revisiting problems is a genius idea
"I really like the quiz new feature. Could you please also include random questions from topics rather than the entire list of question? In this way, each day i can get random questions from topics such as stack, linked list, dp etc. Thanks once again for your new feature and looking forward for the topic wise random questions so that we can review previous questions each day."
CodeForces is better
"I am glad that I bought your lifetime subscription, whole material is already top-notch , and now this upcoming feature to review questions in Quiz form going to be amazing. I will be really grateful to you if you do this Quiz review feature for all 331 Questions, I know its a lot of work but you can release it in phases. Thank you so much for all your efforts."
i thought you were going to show your brain MRI scan
"Hey, I have solved around 500 problems in over 1.5 years on Leetcode but I still feel like I am not able to solve the problem many times and I don't feel very confident in DSA. I feel like I didnt do things the right way. What should I do? Plz help @NeetCode"
"Dude, the quiz idea for reviewing is brilliant. That is probably the best feature of this site. Well done and thanks for all your work."
"35 years in commercial IT, never had to solve any of these synthetic problems in my day to day work, and certainly not in 45 minutes. 

This is simply not how real IT works."
Swapping to Python just for LeetCode sounds like terrible advice lol. Besides that good video.
"whitelisted your channel from SponsorBlock!

can't thank you enough for your work."
I've been in tech for a decade and never needed to solve a LeetCode problem. Nor would I chose to. Helped a few friends prep for FAANG LeetCode though
"I found your neetcode site about 8 months ago, and it has been the most inspirational and direction-giving thing I have come across in leet code prep. Thanks a ton!"
Ignoring the elephant
"what is the difference between the blind 75 , NC 150 and all 331 probs ?"
what program do u use for the drawings?
"As someone that went through a rather difficult elitist undergraduate system (not in the US) to prepare for the most prestigious schools and in a math dominant curriculum, I am not sure about this philosophy of ""give up after 40 minutes"". If you know in advance that you will give up in 40 minutes then you will likely trick yourself into wasting time until you get a solution or will not fully give it everything you have. 

The moment you look at the solution you deprive yourself of the opportunity to challenge yourself and to learn. Some questions do require building on insights of other people so it does make sense to learn the solution patterns for some problems but that's not enough for proper problem solving skills which require methods, tenacity/obsession, flexibility, and creativity. 

I would advocate always telling yourself you have a chance just try it, explore some ideas. If you feel like giving up, leave it alone and come back to it tomorrow and in the shower you might have some really cool ideas. 


When you do look at the solution ask yourself what did I need to think about to come up with this solution?What are the core essential ideas in the solution that would allow me to use it in new scenarios. Would I be able to solve this next year with some more effort using key principles? What are the solution patterns to learn for anything that looks similar to this in the future.

Maybe you don't actually need to be particularly smart in the job your applying for but given all the time involved you might as well do your self a favor in developing problem solving skills which I would guess lasts longer on average than pattern recognition skills from looking at a bunch of solutions"
"Do FAANG employees solve their daily tasks that require thoroughly created solutions under stress and under a timer (30-60 minutes)? Also, do they have a supervisor assigned to each of them? Are they deprived of debugging and other tools? If not - this interview process just doesn't make sense, stop fooling yourself and justifying BigTech companies, work on your critical thinking and dont waste your precious lifetime :)"
Thanks bro. Really need this.
Thanks alot for contributing! I switched to C++ but I stull use your videos to understand the concept! They are really helpful
"Mathematics tell me leetcode is waste of time; 
  Why … 
     Mathematcal problems is very general and generic than …"
Those quizzes sound fantastic
"Thank you so much, this video is amazing and I needed this so much. I do what you described at  with every single Medium/Hard problem. I needed this so much, thank you"
Honestly what is missed with your leetcode problems is the thought process you went thru when you first solved the problem and the actual time it look to solve it. So many of these videos make people feel like solving these are easy when they are not.
You are amazing. Your videos got me into Meta (and then laid off lmao). God bless u.
"The fast review is a great feature , looking forward to it!"
Bro made me depressed on the weekend smiling_face_with_tearthumbs_up
Great effort to create a review section for the questions. Massive respect.
"bro shilled for Taro at the end, can't believe it."
"Maybe I am weird, but I prefer java over python. The verbosity helps me keep track on what I am doing."
One of the best channels I have always look forward to  whenever I get stuck in any LeetCode daily challenge problem or any famous LeetCode interview problem. Love the content!! Hopefully someday I can land my dream job as well!! Love from Indiared_heartred_heart
Man is a legend.
"NeetCode be single handedly saving me hours with my preparation time. I feel much more confident going into my interviews now when I know there's a big chance I understand how to intuitively see the patterns/DS & algorithms required to solve these questions, as well as explaining my thought process while doing so."
Thank you so much
Great video!
So elated to see that you got a sponsor! I remember back in early 2022 when I started watching your explanations and being blown away by how easy you made them seem. Thank you for everything that you've done for our community :)
Hey where is the link to that roadmap tree?
"My count is 220

Edit: 255 now"
thank you!
Thank God i work in Public Healthcare and dont have to deal with this
Love all your content. Awesome stuff.
"I solved 200, I hope I will reach 500."
"Always a pleassure when you drop a video, once again great content and advice!"
Super helpful!!
I love the quiz idea.
where is your brain? I like walnuts.
Greatest video and honest advice i ever got ....thank you so much...for really relatable and helpful videos smiling_face_with_halo
"When I was unable to solve a question and I look into a solution, I used to think I was doing a big mistake, but I didn't have a choice as there is no time ......... But this video changed my misconception and I am really glad that I didn't waste my time and used my time efficiently..... TBH I think I am the happiest person on earth after knowing this!!"
Nice title five69
I solved 100+ problems. Now I can easily spot CIA agents glowing in the dark.
"is it enough to solve problems what you created the roadmap for dsa? i mean that questions is enough for the particular topic
reply"
Always love to see your video. Thank you for the commitment and sharing!
I just finished 100 problem as per your strategy person_surfing
Do you mean it's better to solve Neetcode 150 again rather than going to 569?

Love the content

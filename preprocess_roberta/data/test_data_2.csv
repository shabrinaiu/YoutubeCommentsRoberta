1,"Reason why I’ve lost touch with a few friends is because I found myself being the one that always contacted them to talk and or go out somewhere, until I started feeling like I was being a pest. I stopped and never heard from them again. Good in a way as it saved energy and time and I  could get comfortable with being with myself rather then defining my identify around friends."

1,"I noticed a recurring theme in this video is that to maintain friendships you must physically spend time with your friends. That's not really an option for most people (including myself) since each person embarks on their own path in life which inadvertently results in them usually living a bit far away from where they lived previously. The alternative is to actively try to have conversations with friends despite not ""needing"" to talk to them since they are off somewhere else and their lives no longer involve you. Despite it's apparent futility, it is now more important than ever to try to maintain the few friends you do have even if you can't spend time with them physically."
2,"well, thanks for calling me out dude"
1,such a beautiful video!

1,It’s funny how life works!!! I grew up having a ton of friends and ever since high school and college ended everyone kinda just started fading away and now I really don’t have any friends anymore!!
0,that guy with brown beard is wrong
1,"Lets say totally hipothatically that a person is raized in a bad culture but hipothatically their parents kept them in their home for most of their life so hipothatically the very common bad behaviour dosent spread to that person.
Lets say HIPOTHATICALLY that It worked but since you are in a bad area but you are raized completely differently and hipothatically you only consumed media from a different culture so 
Hipothatically that person is  like a total foriner with very different world view and is more well mannered and well mannered
How will that person make friends

1,"my take on friendships & how to make friends

if u want friends just be yourself & don't care what others think, that's the only thing you need to do, the second you try to follow some formula or put on a fake persona trying to fit in, you're just building yourself up to fall, making friends shouldn't be an ""effort"" friends are something you wake up everyday looking forward to interacting with, i feel like this video's only real important part is at the end where they say ""be laid back, don't have expectations"" all the other stuff is literally if you just can't think for yourself, i think having meaningful relationships over the internet is way more valuable, my best friends are over the internet, all the previous friendships i've had outside the internet were ass in comparison, all of those friends i had irl were made through school or skateparks or something like that & didn't last very long after you or they no longer meet up in those areas that you both visited frequently, while on the internet gaming is broad & simply chatting about each other's very different lives is more entertaining & lively than hearing shit from people next to you talking about something mundane that happened unless you have very similar interests which is so goddamn unlikely it's sad lol

don't know how to put it exactly, real life friends who you'll most likely meet are very likely to have the same shit to say as you & be fake because in person being yourself (if you have problems with it) is hard & you start putting on a persona because it's where you live, you want good reputation & not to become an outcast etc, just fear of being yourself thinking you won't be accepted, i had that shit too at a point until i realized i'm just trying to appeal to them & i'm not really doing myself any favors by behaving this way, whilst on the internet you can be yourself without issue, i meet real people on the internet, irl i've had situations where people cut me off because they can't keep up their ""act"" & all this shit where everyone's time is wasted or when they move away you realize your friendship was held together due to being close to each other irl & lose interest in reaching out to them or never do in the first place, i promise you the only ""real life"" relationships that last are either ones where all individuals included are themselves & don't lie or talk behind each other's backs or a 2+ person relationship where everyone is very dependent on each other

i've had a shit ton of friends irl & over the internet, i would say internet relationships are better despite people who are so afraid to be seen in some ""bad"" way by society claim it's unhealthy & this & that always tryna give you some talk on why you're living wrong because they have nothing better do to with their lives, they're people who are most likely fake as shit trying to give you advice gaslighting you trying to manipulate you into behaving in some certain way that appeals to them lmao, regardless of what i've said make up your own mind & think for yourself, take what you want out of it if it helps, just sharing what i've got from my experiences in life so far


internet friends 10/10
irl friends 50/50 chance of lasting"
2,There’s also the importance of making sure  if they’re the right friend for you
1,"I not 18 yet but it sound very fun and I can make more friends which right now I fell like I only have 2 friends I what more but 8 can't find any I try with most of the people in my grade but none of them are interested in the things that I am in to like playing video games. They all like playing football, going hunting, and things like that there aren't that many people who are in to video games at my school so it is crazy hard to find someone who like the game or even plays video games in general 
If you read to the bottom thank you for hearing my story and have good rest of your day."
1,"It's so sad how many people have gotten used to having no one in their lives. They tell you they're happy and comfortable in the most bitter, regressed voice. People use independence and individualism as an excuse while their minds and bodies just decay and they drift (sometimes sprint) to the end of their lives having never made a real connection."

2,Why u are lonely and how to make friends lmao
1,"take in all of this, put it into a mixing bot and accidentally smash the jar of ""oops you have a medical condition that makes it so people don't want to be around you"" and then try to make a friend group"
1,"as of watching this video I can say confidently that I don't have many friends but the three I have I am very happy right now, and I will try to make more friends now."
1,I pretty much accepted I'll be alone forever. I haven't talked to anyone in over 5 years. I made way too many wrong decisions that I think make it impossible for me to change. I regret everything and the silence is driving me insane. I wish I could've done things differently.
1,"Hey so I am in very severe depression I have many friends but feel very lonely I always try to make as many friends as possible to become less lonely but it never works I always feel like that one filler friend am the stereotypical good kid at school I might be asked for an answer or two but I am almost never asked by a friend how I am doing I am only living right now because I realize thats leaving the world would hurt the people near me more then it would help I also had a pretty big friend group created by me and then a toxic member forced themselves into the group corrupted everyone and they left me, only one person stayed behind and took the time to ask are you alright and told me what happened now my trust issues have gone super critical and I find it very hard to make new friends for fear of them leaving me, many days I have to tell myself many days it would hurt more people then it would help to leave this world, if I’m ever smiling on the outside I’m not on the inside I have tried therapists but they don’t work. I just wish a friend would reach out to me and ask how I am I doing so far I have one person that occasionally asks if I want to go do something with them and this is the friend I had to open up to and the one that stayed with me."
1,"Oh, all the times I've scared people away by oversharing x) But then again, the ones who stay are even better. So I don't know if I buy that part of the theory. Just depends on how selective you want to be."
2,"Would anyone watching this video like to be my friend? Our common interest? We both like kurzgesagt videos.

I also enjoy gaming, anime, and Korean dramas. Let's be friends!"
1,"That ""being present in a class without saying a word makes others more sympathetic to you"" part is completely false. I noticed throughout kindergarten,school and high school (as well as university to an extent) that the always-present and quiet people (I was also one of them) are usually bullying targets which decreases with age, malicious gossip targets which increases with age up to a point, and being ignored which is fairly constant, and if you're silent and generally lonely it can sometimes lead to people trying to manipulate you by pretending to want your friendship, especially if you're an approachable, kind and conflict-avoiding person. Unless you actively try to interact with the others (and sometimes even that fails, especially if you're different in interests, opinions and personality from the predominant types of people in the groups you try to interact with), you will only be approached by very few people with genuine intentions, sometimes even none, sometimes by people who only pretend to have genuine intentions but only want something from you. People often say they would approach and talk to the quiet or different people they see in a social setting, but they very often do not do that for various reasons. It also happened to me to be told that i'm one of the most approachable people in a student house i lived in a few years ago, and yet whenever it wasn't a larger social situation like a house party, i was mostly ignored, with people generally not making attempts to even text me, and yet often making plans with one another that i wasn't invited to, sometimes as i was right there beside them discussing plans they've made"
0,I hate the youttube algorithm.
2,Being to desperate for friends is a good way to not make them.
1,"""Dust off your space marines"" . Good advice but maybe don't mention you had to dust them off, that's pretty close to heresy"
1,"As I'm researching Metaverse, this is what we're trying to solve for Digital world. Bringing people together closer than how mobile phones does.
The fact that metaverse is actually based on gaming suggests that it's not ready for this gigantic problem. I watched this video and learned from my internal that, I actually feel closer if I can see their faces."
0,I take this recommandation as a personal attack
1,"the problem that i face isn't necessarily not being able to befriend people, but staying friends. im very picky about who im friends with, i want someone who i can trust and share feelings with, not just someone who chats with me from time to time about their job or whatever. and a lot of times i tend up pushing them away for whatever reason. im sure that part is something internal that i need to deal with but i still have yet to understand what that something is. it's really sad because i used to have a pretty average friend group but over time they all drifted away. kind of recently i broke it off with my best friend of around 9 years over some petty argument. but i literally couldn't care less. having long-term friends is now a chore for me, and i really wish it wasn't because i hate this feeling of isolation."
1,Lol even YouTube knows i am lonely
1,"Kurzgesagt, I needed this video. I’m 22, just moved to a new city after graduating nursing school, and 6hrs away from all my friends and family. While I wanted to put distance between myself and some of my family members, it’s the loneliest I’ve felt in a long long time. My best friend of 6 yrs started a relationship and he doesn’t talk to me anymore too. You guys help me remember that it gets better, I appreciate you for that."
1,"As an immigrant, making friends was really hard, the cultural and language barriers seem really intimidating, but if you give yourself the chance and try to be active, friends are going to come easily
None of my friends are immigrants, but that doesn't make me feel bad, everyone is unique in their own little way
Also, don't rush things, a friendship can be made on a day, but a good friendship requires months"
1,"proximity is a HUGE part of friendship. my parents lived about a 30 min. drive away from any major town and neighbors that were my age were at least a mile away. This meant that I couldn't ever connect with people face-to-face growing up. While my plan was to make friends in college dorms when I finally moved out, covid sadly destroyed that. It has taken a lot of therapy to even realize that I was feeling depressed because of loneliness. Still don't have a great idea about how to make friends at this point but at least im in a place where I can now."

1,"""Senses of Hew-ma-ur""-  some mouth-breathing idiot.
A moron who believes sense of humour isn't the singular and plural state because it doesn't know; sense = common denominator, it's singularity is what unites the multitude of people who have it. So what if there are different flavours~types of humour, it's still one act of sensing humour. I can sense many types of humour, don't agree see many as worth laughing with but I senae rhem in the singular axt od sensing... mouth-breathers are stupid, that is why they overuse the suffix ""s."""

1,Thank you so much for this! Loneliness and socializing are things that I’ve struggled with for years and years of my life and this video really hit close to home.
2,The only downside of making friends is that they try to be nice to you until they are driving you to kill yourself. And there are some friends who make you feel like you're not belonging to them
2,ABC to be my friend I’m a bit lonely
1,""" True friends are never apart, maybe in distance, but never in heart."""
1,"I don't want friends. They can, even without intention, lead me to fatigue due to intense emotion. When too fatigued, I can get immobilized due to my chronic fatigue syndrome.

If it means I will be less fatigued, as fatigue is painful to me, then I choose to live a life of friendless isolation. Even if friendship is good in general, it is something I am willing to sacrifice to have some peace and less fatigue.

As a writer, I far more prefer to have readers/internet followers than friends. If it weren't for my ability to write then I'd consider suicide more seriously. Nonetheless, I don't see a reason to deem myself a social creature."
2,I think it would be cool if kurzgesagt did like there own version of what the 21st century will be like I would love to see these tackle something like that when ever they can
1,You're really confusing friends with acquaintances and connections. It's incredibly easy to meet people and make acquaintances. It's neigh impossible to actually make and keep a meaningful friend with mutual care and understanding on multiple levels. The vast majority of people aren't worth the investment. Just having a single hobby in common doesn't make a friendship.
1,"I’m really happy that this showed up on my page cuz I’ve almost lost all confidence in myself being able to make friends. It’s like whenever I approach people, I have too high expectations of them, and it’s so hard to lower those. It led to me to losing every single real person in my life. I’ve only got online friends now, whom I haven’t even seen :)"

2,anyone wants to be my friend?
1,keep up these video's they are really helpful and funred_heart
1,"I feel like the number of friends isn't exactly the issue, it's more how meaningful those relationships actually are. Even when I'm surrounded by people who give me attention, I often feel lonelier than if I were by myself. For me, I think the trick is finding people you actually connect with in the first place. Not to mention our culture doesn't lend itself well to motivating people to do anything at all; it's easy when we're younger because we(humans) agree to tell ourselves it is-- our intrinsic motivation is in doing things because things are fun (imagine Spongebob), but as adults, we actively choose to believe everything must be hard and attemtping to steal our happiness (imagine Squidward), because it's deemed more acceptable than believing life is fun. The point in your life where you are demanded to give up your happiness to adopt the misery is when you become ""too old for fairytales"", but this line is ever-moving for the sake of judgement-- which is all it ever was. The modern culture of today is all about proving yourself through independence, sacrifice, and standing alone at the top of your field.. or else. At the best of times, we're indirectly taught to be alone, trust no one, and ask for nothing. At the worst of times, we fear other humans, either directly, or we fear their judgements, and that fear becomes our motivation for further suffering in isolation. Our minds are so preoccupied with not dying, that we never think about living; we bury ourselves before we're gone. It's no wonder we don't have the energy to roll out of bed in the morning, much less make friends. Best advice I can offer is: Dare to live. It's less comfortable than simply surviving, but it feels so much better."
1,"I like quiet spicy food, guess I'm doomed :P"
1,"Friends mean nothing.  We are all strangers.   Why even try when you just don't know the person.  Learn to play an instrument instead.  Through music you can travel to the stars, travel through time, go surfing, party with imaginary people, or just tinker and experiment."

1,"I didn't have many friends in my home country but when I moved, I had to put out the effort. Several years later, GF and I were at a convention where there were no official parties so the answer was easy - locate the cool kids and tag along with them. It quickly became apparent that _we_ were the cool kids - when the hell did that happen? So a quick trip to the liquor store and we had the swingingest party there, thereby cementing our unexpected position. Kind of bizarre, really.
Now I'm back in my home country, distancing is still a thing and I've really got no idea where to begin. Wrong culture, I guess."

1,"well this is an untypical video from you, Kurzgesagt, but thank you. -very extremely lonely person"
1,"I don't know why I watch this, I guess I just felt I have to watch all Kurzgesagt's videos. I'm a misfit, friends have been... not there when another friend ruins my chance to befriend anyone, let injustice happens to me and didn't provide comfort, to trying to push their life choices to me. I also been cutting out friends for 'petty' reasons because my ptsd get ahold of me or disappear when they need me because I am riddled with very bad thoughts. In the end I conclude internet friends is the best I can maintain, yet video like this seems like invalidating internet friends. Maybe they are lesser than real life friends, but internet friends are still precious."
1,"I get that it's ""in a nutshell"" not a deep dive, but most people struggling with this issue will have heard all this advice before, and it's not wrong but it's just not substantive enough for most people to actually be able to use it to change their situation, unless they've been doing something seriously wrong like avoiding other people entirely, or never inviting others to things."
1,Its especially hard as a woman :( females prioritize their partners so all my friends that are in relationships rarely ever make time for me. Makes me want to go on dating apps to kill time w temporary people :(

1,"Thank you for this video. I've just turned eighteen, and leaving highschool, all of my friends are splitting off towards their own futures, and it's terrifying. I love them, and I want them to charge straight towards whatever future they want for themselves, even if it means going away from me. But all that leaves me a bit alone, deprived of the titanic social groups I used to have back in school."

1,I think using love for spicier foods to know extroversion is very wrong
1, Dude I've been saying this for YEARS!. It's always bothered me that despite being able to connect with people around the world in a few clicks that people feel so lonely. Most likely if it's a good time old friends or even newer friends will appreciate a phone call every now and then.

1,"The one bad habit I want to get rid of is my ""later"" mentality. If I'm mildly exhausted, I have to take the rest of the day off, and not even do something I enjoy like drawing or play games, I'll just browse and watch stuff with the ""later"" mentality on the back of my mind: ""I will do [chore] later"", ""I can work on my passion project later"", ""I can get in contact with my acquaintaces later"", ""I can do something for my career later"".

And then I look back on the time I kept saying later and get sad, which makes the need for change more urgent, which leaves me even more exhausted and the cycle repeats."

After asking them are we still good, they said maybe yes maybe not. All the people they hanged out with called me a sucker and emo after this. I’m severely hurt by this and hiding it to other people.

Now i'm 33 working as full time teacher in University, but even with my colleagues, i don't feel the same, they are colleagues, not friends. Loneliness is my shelter."

1,This made me drop a few tears...
1,"I can't make friends. I'm disabled, people don't understand my disability, they think I'm faking it. They insult and mock me. The only choice for me is to be alone, humans can only harm me. I'm not the only one in this situation, if you find someone like me, please make an effort to treat him o her with dignity and respect, it might chance his or her life"
1,"This episode definitely speaks to me. As someone who's moved around my entire life, I've felt I've lacked the very foundation of a social life. There has been multiple times in my life where my number of peer connections was actually at zero.

On top of that, I moved to an island which ended having a very clique and closed off mentality. I had made no friends coming out of highschool, and I hadn't made any friends from work, or college as of yet. Any connections I did make, there was no effort from the other side put in because they didn't need extra friends, they already had what they needed in a social life and I was just an extra add on.

On top of that, I don't get along with most people my age, and tend to only get along with people a few years older than me, which at this point those people are starting to have families, getting invested in their professional careers, or just wouldn't associate with someone my age.

Patience really is the key, and unfortunately it's quite painful. Try finding people who are in the same situation as you. At the moment, my network of relationships is still quite small, but through prolonged effort, I have made a few people I can call friends, even if they are too busy for me most of the time. If you're in the same kind of situation as I am, lacking any friends to make more friends, part of it is just luck. 

They say that there are however many people for you to meet, but they never factor in comparability. There might be a few hundred thousand people in your city, but how many of those are people way older or way younger than you? How many of those people are looking for more friends? How many of those would you actually get along with? As someone who lives in a less populated are, I found that it really narrows it down to none that I'm aware of and have to essentially stumble upon these people. Things like the meetup app don't really work either because due to a lower population, there's just less groups in general.

Even in my difficult situation, it was possible for me to make friends, and I'm still very slowly finding new people. But for those who are already comfortable with their social life, cherish your friends because they can easily all disappear."

1,"I used to be introverted and homeschooled. But once I chose to start school I became, quite literally, a different person. Now I'm entering university and I'm more extroverted than ever. Not sure what I did tbh.. My goal throughout school was the be the guy everyone can talk to. I was friendly to everyone, cracked jokes, I helped plenty of people with homework. 
""Just do it. You will thank yourself later"" Was my thinking throughout secondary school (highschool)."

1,"I've experienced loneliness in the past years but this summer has been the best summer of my whole life. My personality somehow evolved and I started making new friendships. I'm not a social butterfly at all but at least I'm not lonely. This video is a salvation to anyone who actually needs help. Also if you need someone to talk to, I'm here red_heart I know how loneliness can affect lives"
1,I'm not. Leave me alone please. People are just... the worst
1,"Kurzgesagt is one of the few channels that dive into the deep end of the pool (Of the topic they are talking about) and explain it simply but make it so that we actually learn about the topic so that we can easily talk about it in a conversation. Keep going! These videos are fun and educational ( Video request: Can you do a video about the major diseases that occured in the past and explain how they happened? Example: Smallpox, The Black Plague, Covid 19, SARS, Ebola)"
1,"For all the introverts in the replies: it's not written in stone. I used to be very introverted, and now I have a lot of friends (and several deep friendships). It's harder to make friends, but if you put in the effort you can get there. 

I'm usually not a big talker at parties, but I get invited to a lot of them as I have a reputation of making awesome desserts. It works as a great conversation starter too - and I've made friendships that way. 

I also host friends for dinner - again, a surprisingly good role for an introvert as long as you get a good mix of people over."
1,You said in a really really old video that war  isn’t a  thing anymore

1,"I'm currently struggling to make new friends. I had to cut ties with my toxic old high school friends in order to stay mentally healthy and then the pandemic hit. Now, two years later I have no one to call friend other than family members, but its not the same and I don't see them regularly because I live in another city. Thank you for this video it helped me a lot. beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes"

2,Noo now I have too many friends I just wanted to find 1 more
1,Can you please make a Indonesian subtitle please
1," I'm gonna call bullshit on that. I was the more silent kid of the class and sympathy was not a thing I ever got from anyone. Don't know where you guys pulled that one from.
And gee, I wonder why kids are on a cesspit like tiktok...gonna give a hint, bad parenting."
1,I think I came too quick
1,"Maybe it's just my experience, but I've found being present but quiet in class made not just me, but anyone I knew in a similar situation a target for bullies and not worthy of sympathy and inclusion.
It didn't matter who they were, what ethnicity they were, or how smart they were, if they were quiet, they had a massive target painted on their back.

Me, my sisters, my now fiancée, a girl who got on the same bus as me to and from school, a guy I knew but didn't interact with, and many many more.

Anecdotal evidence to be sure, but I've been around long enough to know who a bully will target, and it is never the loud ones."

2,Thank You!!!

1,"Well I have 0 friends :c.. adhd, anxiety and depression hit me hard in my social skills"
1,"As a personal observation, as everything becomes marketable and quickly consumable, so have friendships. I have found that, at least in my age range, no one wants to put in effort to make friends, they just want to add you to their Instagram list and forget. I have tried everything to make friends, but no one is interested, like apparently even the effort to text is too much. I am lonely, but not for lack of trying. Relationships are a 2-way street, and requires action and effort from both sides to work, but no one cares. Tbh, I'm really tired of being let down, talk is cheap, and I really just want someone to prove me wrong and show me that not everyone is going to treat my effort like it's worthless."
1,"For me, it’s mainly the autism that prevents a lot of things. I have a hard time socializing, and sometimes I want to be with friends but then I don’t."
1,"Nah, making friends is easy but not simple. When it happens you just have to be yourself, but making it happen is super complicated and most people don't know how to do it."

1,Thank you. I personally needed this reminder today.

1,"I just don't feel like hanging out with friends, let alone meet new people. Depression makes me not want to go out and also less fun to be around, which makes me lonelier and more depressed, like a feedback loop of negativity. Being social is too much effort, at this point I just want to be left alone, not bothering anyone while no one bothers me."
1,"I moved from Sao Paulo to Belo Horizonte to stay close to whom once I considered to be my best friends who are also my sister and brother in law. Just realized after a dream trip together that they had became bitter, snob and cynical people and our friendship died right then and there. They were my hub and now I feel disconnected. Tried to forgive then but I cant. They are always around since our kids are cousins but sadly it will never be the same as when we were young."
2,I love this channel :)
1,this was posted a few days after I sent a text to an old friend I haven’t seen or talked to since we were 8 years old
1,"I had always had a group of friends until my late 20s and didn't find it hard to make new friends. Though every new circle of friends (mostly because of moving to new places) seemed less close than the ones before and connection to the older cliques faded over time and relations grew more distant, as they developed in different ways than I did. Then it got to a point when I started getting the feeling of just putting effort and time into friendships, being interested in people without getting anything back. When I stopped investing, my ""friends"" wouldn't invest anything themselves. So I stopped ""running after people"". Nowadays I can't seem to find people to connect to. I try. But everytime I think, a relationship might develop into a friendship, I'm wrong. It's not too Bad. I got a social circle of my partner and our families and some not so close friendships. I still long for those from childhood and youth. People you could share interests, hopes, dreams and fears with."
1,The real answer: uninstall League
0,I rather Lonely
1,"What makes this video so dumb is that they completely ignore the double coincidence of wants. ""friendship depends on time invested"" dude NO, it is about time granted. We don't get to decide how much time other people are willing spend with us"
1,"""there are plenty of people who will be so happy to have YOU in their life as a good friend""

I thought they were talking about me for a moment there."
2,even if i got friends i feel like they would leave me
1,"Great video. Important to note that not only is proximity in location important, but also proximity in age. There's life experience gaps and perceived intent which get amplified as the age gap increases. The gathering looks like a great idea, but for me, someone over 50, showing up to a meetup primarily populated by 20-somethings will be associated with the negativity people tend to assign to such an age gap (been there several times unintentionally, consciously mindful of it when looking for friend groups).
I know I have fewer friends once I slowed initiating contact. It really came down to if I wasn't initiating contact, then there wasn't contact. Makes one realize they are really the comet in others' universe of friends."
1,This channel needs to get back to its roots.
2,I feel like I'm learning how to be a human haha
1,"And whatever you do, don't move around too much. Making friends is hard, then moving away all the time is even harder."
1,"As a Teenager (still am btw) I never got a phone, because my parents didn't want me becoming lost in that world and exposed to things that are harmful for me. I ended up losing quite a lot of friends after highschool because we had no way of contacting, so my childhood friends and best friends are now somewhere I'll never see them.

HOWEVER!!
Being part of a church (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints), greatly helped me build close relationships since the members are so kind and are willing to make the sacrifice of annoying to use platforms just to keep in touch.
First time in my 3 years I've felt so loved by others

Also, I recommend reading Dale Carnegies ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" a lot of neat tricks are in there just in case you're struggling in conversations or need help."

2,"How to make a friend (for antisocial)

1,your channel is growing very fast.
1, that's y abstain from attempting friendship. no one could possibly care because everyone is too incompetent and lazy.
1,"Awesome video!

There was a time when I had very few friends and one thing that helped the world over for me was Drama. Now it's not for everyone and it took me nearly a year looking for something to join but basically my advice is look for something to join that matches the vibe you're looking for, it may not come to you straight away but don't give up, it was by pure chance I stumbled into the world of theatre and since then I've made a crazy amount of friends in it. Also if it sounds like your thing I'd recommend drama, it's amazing for socialising, you really get to know a cast spending so much time together (there's also not just acting, many drama groups encourage off stage roles like tech, directing, writing etc.) I've never done professional drama but I'd say maybe social drama is more about the fun of it so maybe better"
2,Alright who's the funny guy who put this in my recommended
1,"Ohhh gee, I wonder if the dictatorial and draconian lockd0wns have anything to do woth that..."
1,"I really resent how American society, at least, coaxes most of us into ditching our high school friends for some distant college, then ditching our college friends for some distant job, only to end up with a new dubious form of friendship between colleagues, and that's ONLY IF you manage to get a full-time job in this economy where employers are desperate to have as few employees on benefits as legally permissible."
1,"Wait, did you say introverts don't like spicy food? I'm extremely introverted and love spicy food."
1,How did YouTube know…
1,"My best advice to anyone who is struggling with their friend group is to join a sports club as long as it’s one you enjoy and not just you forcing yourself into something you enjoy. I’m only 16 so i don’t have the life experience a lot of other people do but I’ve found sports to be such an easy and enjoyable way to meet, spend time with and get to know new people."
1,I would like to have a friend but I haven’t met many people that I believe are real. So much hurt and disappointment over the years have really made it impossible at this point.
1,"Has anyone kind of thought how much the little point about commuting is extremely important for physical exposure?
Car dependent suburbia also contributed to isolation and takes away billions of opportunities for interaction and relation every day. The United States and countries that followed the example have no need to build all infrastructure dependent on cars no matter how physically big a country is. So many countries have made it work without cars and they are some of the happiest places. The fact that children have to be shuttled everywhere until they can drive their own car and soccer moms existing is also a huge contributor to lack of children's experience outside of school with other children."

1,"For me there is a bigger problem. Having an EQ of 0. I have a really hard time to relate to anyone. I can't see the point in being sad when someone passes away. Or be happy when a baby is born. Small talk is something out of a different world for me. And I am amazed when I hear and see people do it al the time. And somehow they are enjoying it. 

The weirdest thing is, I love organising parties and gatherings for family and people i know. But don't like the talks during the events. I have at work more than a thousand people beneath me. I know most of them by name. And somehow they find me a great boss. They tell me and to show me they buy me presents with there own money. Which I am grateful for. But can't understand why to buy your boss a present. I am only doing my job. 

So because I have no EQ and can't relate to people. I don't even know what a friend is, maybe I have them. But I couldn't tell. They have to tell me that we are friends."
1,"Well start right now :
Comment down your name/city and try to meet up with people around ... But just don't give up alot of informations or they will creep on you it thr internet.

1,"I dont have friends since elementary school and im turning 22 soon. I always lived somewhat isolated in smaller towns and after I went to high school without any of my old classmates I really struggled making new friends since all of the class basically knew each other from elementary school and for some reason noone seemed to like me. So I became more and more reserved and shy. I still did a lot of sports back then but I never got to know someone through that and for some reason I lost interest in all of them. I tried new sports like volleyball, karate, track and field, dancing classes, climbing... but after a while I just lost interest. So Ive started spending my afternoons with gaming which obviosly didnt help. Sometimes I played with classmates but it always seemed like they only did so because they didnt want to exclude me. Not because they enjoyed me being around. And since I (still) suck in multiplayer I mostly play single player games. 
My afternoons still look the same but now I cant enjoy anything really because everything I do just feels like im wasting my time. I go to work in the morning and come back home to watch youtube all day long in the afternoon. Weekends are no different.
Ive met new people every now and then of course but the only interest people my age seem to have is drinking alcohol until they dont remember anything. And well I dont like the taste of alcoholic drinks, I dont get more talkative and I basically only get sick. Obviously Im super fun at parties when Im always sober so I never get invited to shit. 
In the rare occasion I meet someone who shares some interests it just doesnt work out for some reason. And I start to feel like i gotta be boring af besides being a little quick witted which I only am with people I know for a certain time. I just dont have anything to talk about, no special interests, no past or current activities, no shared stories with old friends and when ever I want to meet up with someone I just dont know what to do with them: Cinema? Wooow what a boring thing to do together; Hiking? Almost too much time to talk with nothing to talk about and for some reason they always say they like it but when I ask they dont want to do it; Just chilling together, walking around in the city, maybe drinking a coffe? Noone ever said yes to that... at least not when I asked.
So here I am rotting in my room with no goals to achieve while society drives itself against the wall with its morbid ""be the best you"" mentality only to post it on social media for internet attention. I truly am sick of life."

1,It’s nice to see that kurzgesagt acknowledges the fact that TikTok is eating up teenagers’ lives lol
1,"""Although you are perfectly average"" - is this a personal attack?  

But all jokes aside - thank you so much Kurzgesagt for continuing doing videos like these, I firmly believe we can achieve so much together as friends and as humanity, if we'd be a little bit closer to each other, and lead such more happier lives. As someone who had a very vibrant social life in my 20s - I know exactly what that feels like and it's worth taking small steps and risks towards it, because once you do find a community or surround yourself with people who truly care and understand you, and you do so for them - it makes a huge difference in your happiness and mental health"
1,One day my father woke me up early and said we were going to a new school. I didn't previously get anybody's number or I never invited them to my house and soon I became very depressed. This is the reason why you have to engage with friends more and invite them to things. Unfortunately I learnt the hard way.

1,"Creating a group chat called ""ULTRA FRIENDS"" is such a toxic move. What if you forget (or intentionally leave out) someone that the other members consider a part of the group? I would strongly suggest another name, so it's either easier to include more people later, or argue for why that one person shouldn't be invited. On the flip side, it would kinda suck to find out that one of your few friends created a group chat called ""ULTRA FRIENDS"" and you weren't invited.

Better name it something thematically different (""Puns R' Us"", ""Football!!!"", ""Gamerzz""), so that the members aren't defined by the trait of already being an ULTRA FRIEND."

1,"I definitely had a lot of friends and a vibrant social life from early childhood till about my early twenties, somewhere around 25 I realized all my friends were gone. Whether it was a falling out or just naturally losing touch, it just slowly happened. It feels like the expansion of the universe. All the stars and galaxies are expanding and getting farther away from each other. Or better way to put it, it feels like I was on a big crewship but it sank and now everyone is separate on their own life boats drifting out to sea farther away from each other."
1,My problem is that i cant distinguish when the person is trying to be my friend or just being gentle

Also they say making friends its easy but I think its more of a 50/50 with new people, if the conditions are right"

1,I used to push people away. Possibly because of the way I was raised. Now I see that that was just stupid. I absolute hate being alone all the time.
1,No one believes me when I say that it's difficult for me to make friends. They think that girls are really good at making friends which can be true but not for me. I have been trying to go out and be more open to people but I just can't. I want to have someone to share my feelings with but there is no one except one guy. Btw he is also moving to a new place now and then I'll have no one.
2,Why don't you create a discord server for making new friends
0,why the  hell  this is  on my feed

Ive always known this. If i Kill myself nobody besides family would truly care which sucks but shows how pointless it is as a mode of expression and escape.

Nothing happens you are forgotten and it just happens again with someone else. 

I have given up with making friends because it takes too much effort and ive been disappointed enough in my life.

Im not happy, my life isnt ideal but i am fed and warm. 22 with no job, possibly no education and a completely destroyed self view. 

Im going to hate life but lets hope I can find brief moments of respite in something I hate."
1,You didn't have to rub it in
2,"I'm quite good at making friends, just not keeping them, but I'm getting better at putting the effort in to maintain friendships"
1,"i have no friends , couldn't go to a university , my country don't have meetup groups"
1,Idk man. But kurzgesagt content have summon everyone existential crisis
1,"I would love to have more closer friends, however I have a large amounts of friends already now from many different areas of my life. The thing that troubles me most however is the fact that I am constantly feeling I do not deserve friends. This comes in forms of large amounts of false guilt after the day is over and regret in things that really shouldn’t be regretted."
1,Its nice to be told you're lonely by the YouTube Algorithm.
1,"great video, but i kinda miss when kurzgesagt focused on more science based physics topics as opposed to the social ""science"" topics they do now"
2,I love how this told me nothing and everything at the same time.
1,"I’m must be weird. I literally love my alone time. When I’m sad, I want to be alone too recalculate my thoughts. Same with happiness, and madness. When I have questions.. i ask a professional… which ends up being me…. Since I know myself and know what I need to do. I’m no lone wolf, just love being with myself. <3 like driving alone at night with snacks and a playlist of my favorite music!"
1,Dude I almost cried because I remember so many old friends that I lost contact with
1,dude they finally made a video for the league of legends community
1,"""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.""   
 -John 
God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. 

We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him. 
We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins. 

He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven

Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends
Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.

May God Bless you all!"
1,"Typically, when people/old friendships reach out to me, it's almost always because they need something. Like a networking scheme or something."
1,"Yep, you guys posted this video at the exactly right time."
1,I feel called out by this video...
1,Finally a video for me
1,Why has this been everyday on my home page for 8 days
1,"I can't wait to see the improvement in Kurzgesagt's animations after a few years. I loved this video. As someone who doens't make that many friends, this is a pretty good way to understand how others are feeling as well as how to build friendships and take the first step to starting a connection. I'll try to keep this in mind while making friends."
1,"Hey Kurzegesagt, this actually helped so much with me. I moved to middle school some time back, and its a very hard time. Thank you"
2,you stranger hi I want to be friends :)
1,"Thank you Kurzgesagt, please make more such videos on such humane and social topics instead of hardcore science/sciencefiction"
1,Why am i ever born in the first place!
1,"Is there a way to organize a meetup without using Reddit. I've been avoiding the site for mental health reasons, and would prefer using nearly any other social media app."
2,I love new friends. But it's kinda sad at the same time knowing they're just temporary.
1,I always try to meet my friends at least once in 3 months or at least send a text checking on them even though there is nothing to share or to talk about.
1,"""Our brains are hard wired to seek connection"" - mine is certainly wired to feel terrible without connections, but at the same time, it lacks genuine drive to reach out to people. Being lonely sucks, but on it's own, it's not sufficient motivation."
1,its almost impossible to make friends as an introvert that isnt in college or that doesnt go to bars
1,"Guys, you are amazing! 
I hope you will get to 20M on this week if it's possible. I wish that one day you will be able to not worry about budget anymore. 
and maybe one day - change the world :)"
1,"Because autistic (and 48), I've given up on making friends. Trying to survive a constant state of depression is hard enough. Although two weeks ago, I sent ""Have fun there! You and your family are doing well?"" on a former (2-3 years) colleague's Instagram holiday picture. The next day, I noticed I had been defriended/unfollowed because of it. Rejection sensitive dysphoria is unbearable."
1,My town just sucks nothing to do here .old age and death white_flowerskullhourglass_not_done hard to makes friends here .but I got a few friends.

1,"it's so accurate to assume that all your viewers are lonely, because we are"
1,"It's all about balance, and I find that life is about learning how to balance. We spend our first years learning to balance with our physical bodies, learning to use it to explore. I find that people forget, and that's okay, but with no recoil for wanting to find balance again can be a detriment with harsh effects."
2,Just a few minutes ago? WOW!

1,Can I get an F in the chat for all the chronically ill people out there who cannot participate in casual face time and do not have the energy level of their peers
1,I think you forgot the most important part: friends who stab you in the back and make you leery about making new friends
2,"Friends make life good? No, friends make life complicated and messy."
1,Hello Kurzgesagt I love your videos and it would be awesome if you made a podcast :D
1,the only person i have in my life is my girlfriend i dont have any friends and alot of people reading this will be like “YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND WHY ARE YOU EVEN COMMENTING” because a girlfriend dosent mean that im not lonely or miss going out or miss having some people i can joke with in a way i cant with my girl or go out play sports to stupid shit enjoy my teenage years that are coming to an end realll sooon so yeah my only advice is be great full for the friends and dont push people away because one day you will be sitting in ur bedroom and look at your phone and notice nobody messeged you for months nobody said happy birthday once it came and you really fail to appreciate how nice it is when someone asks you how ur day has been or if u got anything bad going on in ur life i hope that soon i will gain some friends soon and if ur reading this and kind of associating ur self with this comment then i hope ur situation gets better and you gain some friends too BUT! its not the end of the world if we dont get any friends its fine it will all work out trust!

1,Pain to watch still offline friends 2 or 3 years.
1,OMG IT WORKED
2,bruh why did I get this recommended
1,Why does it always feel like I am the only one making an effort I wonder?
1,Don't forget the rejective people. Those who always judge one person on his appearance or anything different in him and start rumors about him and spread it to everyone. Sometimes it's the people around us who cause these diseases. It's why I isolate myself at home and avoid social contacts. Can talk but I don't trust anyone because a day after I'll find out that they were making lies about me
2,Nice video thumbs_upthumbs_up Good smiling_face_with_heart-eyesred_heartred_heart
1,I've always been a loner for most of my life. I guess it's fate I was the shy and quiet kid. I wish I didn't have social anxiety. This video helped a bit.
1,incredible video. fav part was sun/moon/halo symbolism as the energy of wellness/being that we gain and share in social engagement
2,"I actually like being alone and lonely
All I want is peace"
0,My mother: “ITS BECAUSE OF THAT FUCKING PHONE!”
1,"I've thought myself as a library of various social interaction for most of my recent adult life, where I've not only felt what it's like being around people of different emotional states, opinions and world views, but also learned how to adapt to isolated social atmospheres because of it. While the upside is that I've developed interest for a lot of things that could be seen as contradictory among some social circles, the downside is that I don't invest much time creating social connections enough to be an active part of anyone's life and continuously fall back to my old introvert lifestyle as a result. This video really hits the nail on how difficult and time-consuming it is to create friendships, but if you've done the ""social trading"" long enough you'll find it easier to retain it. You just have to think about it as a human necessity more than a chore, and the process is no different than anything habitual in our lives."
1,"Meanwhile me: Everybody in my class hates me because I like to learn,...."
1,At first when i saw this video on the list i thought youtube algorithm was taking shots at me.
1,Human just simply can't be trust and I chose to fence them off before they hurt me. I used to believe that friendship is exiting but that how naïve I'm I back in the past. Not anymore... I love a lot of your video kurzgesagt but I call this one bullshit. There is no friend in the race that specialize in lying.
2,"The problem is with friends. I only had one good friend who is not a real friend,I realized that hes using me when he has no company. Then after when we play games,he saod that i am not his best friend anymore that he have other good friends (that are not even talking much how much i am). By the way the video was good."
1,"Kurzgesagt videos always cause a bit of existential discomfort but this one really hurts. It's one thing to think you have a problem making connections but a whole video showing that you have no idea how to make them and the instructions provided are completely beyond your abilities is a whole new level of pain.  
Isolation and loneliness to the end it is then.  Crap."
2,I’m 31 and it’s really hard to make friends at my age. I’m too old and I didn’t make friends in school so it’s difficult to find people that I don’t mis trust. I feel like women my age just want someone to watch their kids. I don’t like kids
1,"I've tried, it's hard when everyone is so digitally focused and already established in groups"
1,Video made me tear up. Been a hard time
2,"I wish I had friends, no one cares lol"
0,I hate myself for having to search something like this on the internet.
1,THis video stirred up so much anxiety with me and I just cannot process why... I cant even finish the video
1,"I’m lonely because I don’t have friend duh 
How to make friends - let’s see, before watching the video, probably going to say the generic join groups/clubs where you’ll meet someone you have something in common with, or join communities online, act friendly, etc.
Proximity doesn’t work for me and none of the people in the past stuck around."
1,Im lonely because I spend all of my time watching Kurzgesagt videos.
1,its funny how this video was released just before my university entrance.
1,"i didn't watch the video but remember people

friends are always equals! ones you are not equals, you can't be friends.

so, if you think you are inferior to someone you cannot be friends with them. similarly, don't look down on someone if you want to make friends. 

just know and understand that we are all equals. only an ignorant person thinks of oneself as superior or inferior. 






second point.

never need anyone. 

when you are self sufficient you respect yourself. when you respect yourself others respect you too. In fact others can only respect you if you respect yourself. this is because you know yourself whereas others don't. if you don't like or respect yourself, neither will others. 

how to respect yourself and not need anyone? everyone know whats right and whats not. if you keep doing things knowing they are wrong, you loose respect in your own eyes. for example, you should have the discipline to hold back your urge to eat unhealthy, watch porn, wate time etc. 

so when you start doing the right things, you become independent. for example, if you studied well on your own you wouldn't need a network of friends to finish an assignment. 

people help people who don't need help. its strange but true. Because people help almost always like an investment not out of good will. 
(btw don't do this either or else you are calling yourself a looser subconsciously. because you have decided someone is permanently better than yourself and that you need to be on their good side to get by)

so yeah, dont do things as an investment. talk to everyone for the sake of it. trust me, people will be attracted towards you, because then you will be the real deal."
1,Haven't watched Kurzgesagt in years and yet YouTube recommends me this. I'm taking it personally skull
2,The algorithm knows lol
1,The most useful 13 minutes in my life!
1,Kurzgesagt is not kurzgesagt without rekting you without even trying.
1,okay man i basically signed up for loneliness as soon as i started playing obbies pensive_face
1,Because I use reddit and that makes people jealous that I'm smarter than them

1,"I honestly just wish I wasn't autistic sometimes. Socializing isn't easy, or even possible sometimes. Leaves me thinking friends are just another fear :/"
1,"As someone who used to have really bad social anxiety and was completely isolated for my early twenties, I have some advice (in addition to what is said in this video):

-Read the first two parts of 'How to Win Friends and Influence People' by Dale Carnegie: Specifically, the sections titled 'Fundamental Techniques in Handling People' and 'Six Ways to Make People Like You.' These made me so much more confident in social situations as I now know how to navigate almost any social situation (not saying this book is a silver bullet to curing social anxiety, but it definitely helps).

-Try volunteering for a cause you're passionate about. I've tried going to meet ups that had the sole purpose of making friends and socialising. But the issue is that because making friends is the sole purpose, all the interactions feel strained and forced, and it becomes hard for friendships to form organically. But if you volunteer somewhere then making friends becomes a secondary purpose as you all work towards a common goal, allowing friendships to form more naturally.

-Find people who are interested in the same things as you are. I formed a band with strangers I met on Facebook, but because we all share a passion for the same kinds of music, we've all bonded over music and became friends.

-Don't be afraid to seek psychological help. It took me years to overcome my social anxiety and self-esteem issues, and at times it felt like a frustrating and futile journey. So if you feel that frustration of loneliness and feel like you've tried everything, then believe me I know how that feels, I felt that in my bones for years. But if you keep at it then it gets better with time, just be prepared to be *really* patient with yourself and the process. And be kind to yourself :)"

YouTube isn’t in the best spot right now, but you guys always have new and refreshing videos. So keep up the good work and stay healthy!"
1,I need Kurzgesagt to chill and not call me out 56 minutes after I just woke up.
1,"Great video.  I have made a huge spectrum of friends through my local running community. When I say spectrum: I met my wife, really great friends, good friends & MANY acquaintances. The simple act of sharing a hobby and spending time with them on a regular basis makes it very easy to get to know new people and foster relationships if you are willing to put in a little work (take an interest in getting to know others).  Its interesting I would say that running specifically shaped me from more of an introvert to  someone a bit more outgoing.  Having so many casual conversations on runs with friends and strangers just kept getting easier over time."
1,"Try making friends on switzerland

A real pain in the A"
1,"I suppose that is the optimistic side to it: The more lonely people there are out there, the more people there are, by consequence, who would be open to an invitation to do something together and become friends. It can be a tough paradox as someone with sensory issues who can't stand large crowds or noise to ""find people."" Even still, D&D groups and volunteer opportunities have helped me see new people, I'll keep looking in my area."

1,Kurzgesagt roasted us with the thumbnail alone
1,"coming out of left field with this one, yet i cant say it encompasses everyones experience, but as an (first gen) american: i feel that a hugeee contributing, but ""invisible"" factor for why its hard to make friends in person would be just how car centric our society here is. god forbid living in a city with even worse traffic, but even small towns composed of many spread-out suburbs suffers from this too. 

being on a college campus was the best social stimulus in my past few years. i walked everywhere, bumped into friends/acquaintances and conversations and brief hangouts were so natural. it reminded me of when i lived in sydney and tokyo for a year or two, seeing people using the same lines on a schedule as me led to many ""chance encounters"" with friends that led to more friendships. getting to sit and chat with friends on the commute back home from school/work was really enriching, and if there was no one i knew? i could read a book or catch up on videos without having to focus on drive back home alone.

living in LA was rough, only the people within a short distance of you would wanna hang since it took too long to drive to the other parts of the sprawl. seattle and sf were a little better with the lightrail and bart respectively, but still quite not the same. let alone both those cities are against the water which raises high traffic chokepoints when driving through the city. atlanta? dont get me started but at least it isnt LA. nyc was great because of the subway, but uh the nyc has a lot to yearn for when you compare it to european and asian countries' public transit infrastructure nowadays.

anyways thats just my 2c, and it was recently sparked by a friend playing persona 5, asking me if it was really like that in shibuya. i went, ""yea pretty much lol"". maybe not so much a slice of life as a Game but texting friends being like ""hey meet me at this station when we get off work and lets hang"" since all this travel, living back in my hometown in a decently sized town in alabama just shell shocking how i was deprived of this as a child."
1,"I honestly don't know if extreme loneliness comes out from, well, loneliness. From being alone and unable to find someone to hang out with.
I am pretty convinced it comes from more and more popular ghosting - that is, disappearing without a trace. After you make your friends and one of them pops out of existence, cutting out all ties to everyone else (which is exceptionally easy online) you are left alone with horrible loneliness, with a hole in your heart you desperately try to fill with something. You develop anxiety and fear that somebody (or even everybody) can do it. And they can easily do it. No strings attached other than a random thought once in a while, that maybe they hurt someone, but they'll never know."
2,"Thank you
Lately I been feeling lonely"
1,"""You're perfectly average""

Thanks, man"
1,It isn't the issue to find people it is more that they stay and do not unfold as a total waste of time and energy because they are just trash.
2,Joining a sport team is a very good way to make friends and its really easy.
1,By far this is most bullshit video from kurzgesagt. It's so stupidly trivial I can't believe being owned by Bill Gates can bring so much banality to world. Thanks!!!
1,this makes no sense for someone who actually struggling sociality every time and never been better i ve always felt alone noone were close to me i ve been left from a friendship on very stupid things like even not understanding a single word and noone just are positive to me
2,I love this and will never take any action and die alone because I am scared of people
1,"My father work at a job that requires him to move every 2-4 years. I used to be able to make friends so easily, but now, I honestly don't even have the energy. Not only that, but he's found a stable job in a foreign country, meaning that I am stuck in a nation where I don't even speak their language, and they don't speak mine. It's been a year since I've moved here, and honestly, I haven't felt so sad and lonely in my life. Any advice for me? I honestly feel so hopeless right now. I feel like I can't even get exited about things anymore. All I do is study, study, and sleep. As I said, I don't even have the option to open up, and it feels like someone is laughing at me because of it. I don't want to say this, but I think my parents' decision is slowly ruining me."
1,Imagine watching this
1,"One issue I have with this video is the ""meet people in real life part""
I've met many friends online and that doesn't take away from the relationship we have"
1,I think this is why miniature wargaming is still popular given the cost and time investment. I have often gone on a trip across the country (US) had some down time and found a ready made community in hobby stores. The gamers all share a unique base culture and although each community is a little different I've always been more or less welcomed to play a game or whatever. Boardgames can do the same I'd imagine. Anything where there is a goal and one must be there in person to do makes for a ready made atmosphere for making friends
0,I don't want new friends. I want readers to read my comic.
1,"I'm just so tired of like not having actual friends i just hover from people to people until they get bored of me, im so jealous of my ""friends"" like, they have a lot of other friends and talk to other people while I'm always the left out one, i know it's probably something with me bcs if i was a great person to be around i think i would have friends"

1,"Man, I've been struggling so hard with this since college (graduated 4y ago) and it often feels like everyone around me already has friends and doesn't need more.
I will say, something I've recently found that helps take pressure off myself is just calling out that I want to be friends haha
Like I'm vibing with someone and I'll just say ""are we becoming friends right now?"" it's silly and can ease some of the tension, also gives a good opportunity to read how they feel about it"
1,"It's wild that half of the things in the video are abstract blobs, but somehow they make perfect sense. Masterclass in visual design."
1,"I think social media, smart phones, all these technologies are to blame for people being distant from one another.  We've got tons of friends on social media - but there isn't anyone in real life.  There used to be strong connections and bonds before as people interacted in person and knew one another on a personal level.  It is quite sad to be honest....it's very true with families as well - everyone's is always on their phones...and there's barely any close relations!  That's how people get lonely....very unfortunate!!"

1,"See thars the problem. I DON'T want to be in close proximity of others, yet I'm alone. I wanna find people to text with and meet once every 3 months. Like why is this not a thing? Why is it so generally accepted that you have to be so EXTRAVERTED to not be lonely?"
2,"so making friends is 99.9% about luck. Thanks, good to know.
- spend time around shit people, and you are screwed."
1,"As a child or teen, yes due to free time and casual activities i definitely had more friends. As an adult work took priority and even though i worked to have a means to live, most people around me didn't or their work took over and we didn't spend a lot of time together. Many of these friends have no trouble including me in their activities but they often refused to participate in things that i was stimulated by and i generally did things i enjoy alone and this increased the social gap. In general being Neuro Diverse doesn't help a lot when people around are being Neuro Convergent."

1,I always struggled making friends. I always feel like I am somewhat not fit for them or I don't belong in the friend group. I had always been everyone's friend but being everyone's friends meant not belonging in a specific friend group. It's feels so empty

1,"Great video but it’s not always so easy. Even as someone who has tried hard to invest in friendships in my 20s, the sad truth is, friends are hard to keep. Sometimes they would often rather spend time on work, specific hobbies, family, or new “friends” who may be new people they just find novel in the moment. Also the interactions must be positive. Jokes at ones expense in either direction create a feedback loop until resentment builds. And sometimes saying the wrong thing, getting a fact wrong, or not being able to physically demonstrate some skill at a hobby or pastime they like can lead to growing condescending attitudes. It’s actually incredible how often this cycle can repeat itself. Many of my friends and my friends friends have been lost this way. Either you have to have a shared charisma, which is rare. Or meet someone genuinely open minded to someone who may just do things a little differently, which is far rarer."

1,Thanks Kurzgesagt. Just what I wanted to wake up to this morning face_with_tears_of_joy loudly_crying_face

1,Gay + cringe + L
1,Getting full score in the driving exam and then coming home to a new Kurzgesagt video. Yes thank you!
1,I needed this.
1,"What’s going on with all these people saying “I don’t need friends, all they do is weigh me down, being alone is better”
Everyone needs friends! Our brains are wired to seek social interaction. You might not realize it right now but it’s a really great feeling to have somebody to talk to, even if it’s just like 1 person. Trust me, it is an endeavor worth taking. 
If you’re introverted just find other introvert friends. There are plenty in this day and age who will be happy just to quietly talk with you every once and a while."
1,"was looking for this tutorial, thanks maight"
1,Imma get rejected anyway but thanks thumbs_up
1,"Man, that hits hard. I know it is a thing that takes effort to keep them around but my anxiety makes me feel guilty for not talking g to them more often, so I get worried they will be weird I haven't been around for so long. It is easier for my mind to just not interact, but more than that just seek g them there online makes the anxiety worse, knowing they are getting on with their friends but I just watch from outside and ultimately remove them so I am content but lonely.

""Worst case, they are not interested and it stings for a few hours."" Yeah... Try think of casual pass people that you never got to know, years later... It never leaves my mind just hides for a time and then come back to remind me  I can't talk to people."

1,I have no friends because I generally dislike people and want as little to do with them as possible.
1,Since i'm German i get thr refenrece at  eyes
1,The first step of the community event you are talking about would require me to open a reddit account which is already too intimidating for me!
2,Friend sent me this… most helpful info ever
2,Can you pls make a video on how to lose friends
2,"Than you Kurzgesagt, I love the topics you discuss."
1,I have to agree as loner for whole 16 year  from when i was born. Yeah i have friends but not so close. I rarely even go out of my house from the day i was born. Family members but not meet them. I feel like loneliness is killing me. I was lonely before but had people with me but now i all alone in a room. During lockdown i got that emo anti social were cool due to anime and internet but now i think i need some people to talk.
1,I think this is probably the most important video you guys have made.
1,Animation quality is lower than usual.
1,why would anyone would want more people in their life? if anything i want less of them. if you cannot be fulfilled in the presence of your own mind - you have already lost. and once you can - people become hindrance
1,Why'd this get recommended to me.  I'm feeling attacked by the algorithm loudly_crying_face
1,Finally a video that tries to help with my existential dread!
1,"I truly love your channel Kurzgesagt your videos are informative, fun, cheerful, happy, educational, eye opening, they provide great relative scientific information and data to help us make sense of the things we find in common with the video at the time. They all have this quirkiness to them and I like the mission of your channel with the community built around it. You do a great service that I don't think you truly know how greatful we are when you post new ones. So thank you for the hard work the team does."
2,"I respect everyone who were involved in this , seriously the best piece that I ' ve ever seen on YouTube ,Hats of the Well All ! Love your videosbeating_heart"
1,Depression and a very low self-esteem have made me lose contact with some of my closest friends and has made me afraid to go out and meet new people in person :(
1,As a young teen I really needed advice for my social life especially the romantic ones and kurszgesagt I love you for this one. Please keep making quality content
2,I love how kurzgezackt went from like bacteria space and aliens to how to male friends face_with_tears_of_joy

2,Solitude is great.
1,who is here being really loney and this just casually appeared in the playlist?face_with_open_mouth
2,"I love this channel, so damn much."
1,"Related to opening up to your friends, is there a video's worth of content around fear of judgement from others? One of the things I struggle with most that I'm focusing on, is just being myself and not caring what people think of me. I want to be a person who can break free of that social prison, but it's so hard. I constantly worry about what others think of me, not just friends, but random strangers, to the point where I feel like I'm holding back from doing the things I want to do, and I'm painfully aware that I do it, but not sure how to get past it.

Anyway, loved the video. Shot a few messages to friends who I haven't heard from in a while, it's something I should do more often."
1,i wonder why this got recommended to me even though i havent watched a single other video on this channel
1,bro the animation of a guy dancing on tiktok is so goofy skull
2,I just want to thank the whole kurzgesagt team <3
0,How tf you see my depression
1,"I wish I had gotten this years earlier. To anyone seeing this video, do take notes."
1,ah the Kurzgesagt video i needed
1,"I'm terrible at maintaining friend connections as I lack the energy to keep in touch and figure life just goes on so they probably don't care enough to want to stay in touch anyway.
I've realized recently that the energy to maintain connections has to go both ways and I have to take the initiative to bring out opportunities to hang out and chat with people.
This video couldn't have come at a better time, cheers Kurzgesagt!"
1,I guess YouTube read my mind
1,"I've cut many toxic people from my life, never been happier. Obviously social interaction is needed but I'd rather not be brought down by it."
1,Always remember you are never alone :-)
1,"I am literally realizing that being alone and not having a great social life at all is hurting my mental health and I am about to go to my first year of uni and I was hoping to make friends there. Real friends I can hang out with, talk to and do things with, never had those. This video’s timing is very optimal"
0,"Too bad I don't really get lonely, just really fucking bored"
1,Why do I feel like I'm being called out? face_with_tears_of_joy Hello? Still lonely ay..
1,"""It helps if you work in a job that attracts people like you, so you might consider this when you choose a career.""
This.
I realized this way too late in life and now kind of regret having studied what was the most appealing to me rather than what attracts like-minded people.
Although - those things (philosophy and art) mostly aren't suitable to earn an income, so... after graduation, I still might not have had many opportunities to meet like-minded people.
I certainly met two people like that. Unfortunately, two isn't a lot and it didn't work out with them, although we had a lot of fun for a number of months."
1,A Discman when did the animated video 10 years agowoman_raising_hand
1,"The first advice is confirmed accurate 100%
I work in a company. I and other colleagues just hangout a little about 15 minutes a day. After 3 months, we are already connected.
I miss this connected friends so long. I'm grateful I had it again. So you can do that too."
2,"Drop your cellphone, you will get friends!"
1,"This obsession with absolutely having to spend time with people ""in the real world"" as the only way to make real friends is a bit misleading, and takes away from the millions of friendships that are formed online every day.

The rest is on point."
2,"*_”Caring and Sharing”_*

1,My intreverted ass after seeing the title: YES FINALLY A VIDEO MADE FOR ME
1,Another amazing video! Helped me tremendously
1,"I thought making friends is hard.
After I saw this video, I now know that I was wrong.
Making friends is way harder than I thought."
1,I'd rather have a shorter life. People have become too wrapped up in themselves and games.
1,"I dont have any friends for over 5 years now. You dont need them, but its nice to have. Real ones. Not fake friends. Many people annoy me, call it a disease, call it a mental dissorder. Many people are just simple stupid animals. I push those as far away as possible."
1,Bruh i was literally just feeling sad that i havent talked to much people and i felt lonely.
1,"I'm 35. Till this day I don't have friends at all.
On top of that I'm still a Virgin.
Social interaction is when I go to a store.
School every year I ate, work did projects alone."
1,Fact: Sometimes you still feel lonely when you have a lots of friends.
1,When I was in the 1st grade I had no friends and walked around by myself during recess. A group of people called out to me asking if I wanted to play football I told them I didn't know how to catch a football... They all took time to teach me how to play and now I'm an adult and looking back that one event of them being nice to me has had taken great affect on my life and social life. Hopefully I'll make new friends in adulthood
1,I’m also feeling isolated and without friends.  My last friend fell to Q-Anon during COVID and we aren’t speaking.  I’d love to meet new people and form new friendships but I simply think I’ve forgotten how…
1,Kurzgesagt videos are starting to get a bit *too* personal
1,"My 21st birthday is tomorrow and I’m spending it alone, having some friends sounds nice upside-down_face"
1,"I've been feeling a lot lonely these days. I'm 22. About to graduate. And just when I finally am out as a gay person in college and how it felt free to finally claim it and be who I am, I felt like I've wasted a lot of my time being who i was not and i would have had more friends and more meaningful moments if i just accepted myself. And now, adulting life. I feel like some of my other classmates have stronger relationships than me. But I'm still hopeful coz now im finally ME! And I am hoping I get to discover more friends and rekindle old ones. I love you all! We will find our people and some of them we already found and we just need to nurture them. Stay kind to yourselves! xoxo"
1,Kurzgesagt definitely knows it's viewer base
1,"I already had friends, but I see a lot of people who say they don't have any in my circles. Thank y'all for the trustworthy and inspiring information as usual!"
1,"
Me, an introvert who likes loud music and spicy food: eyemoutheye"
0,Damn kurzgesagt... that's one harsh title
2,Thx I needed it ;)
2,im all out of friends. been texting my parents when i want to converse with someone. i guess its better than nothing
1,"Fantastic vid, one we all needed. Keep it up guys <3"
1,"Damn, Kurzgesagt Roasting me and everyone else with that title"
1,"The spicy food part threw me. All the extroverts I know hate spice (one used to tell me she found bell peppers spicy). Meanwhile, as an introvert I tend to enjoy spicy food and my friends who also tend to be introverts also like spicy food. I have known exceptions in both directions, but my experience overall appears to not be typical with the general distribution of that."
1,"What if you don't know how to talk to new people? There have been times where I catch myself just standing there and staring at the person talking to me because I have no idea what to say to relate to the topic we are talking about. Then I just look like a fool or it may seem to them that I don't want to talk to them. I try to relate to everyone, but when they talk to me, I have no idea what questions to ask or how to keep the conversation rolling. I have tried different methods in order to keep or make friends, but nothing so far has seemed to work. I'm definitely not alone all the time, it's just nobody seems to want to hang out with me and I believe it's because of the lack of my communication and not knowing what to say. 
This video definitely opened up my mind and I really, truly enjoyed it!"
2,I don't think I need too msny friends. There is few who could be my friends.
2,What about love
1,"Thanks for these videos. I'm really very mean to myself and it helps me to put everything into perspective, that others are having the same problems :)"
1,"All my friends emotionally black mail me that they will remove me from the group,if I don't behave well. I mean what? I just be MYSELF... And I literally just being funny and goofy! Basically I am class clown and I can make my classmates laugh easily. And my laugh is loud and funny, so they don't like it... They think that I am being a little to much. So they blackmail me by saying that they will remove me from the group... Idk whether they understand my feelings or not.. Because of them, now I lost my confidence in making friends. I am insecure that whether others will accept the way I am or not.. So,I just talk a less with my friends...pensive_faceThey also removed one of the girl from the group. And were about to remove me too,but you know what,I was just so done with taking all the shits.. so I cried and they then took me back to there group again. But you know,they went back to there normal rude behaviour once again. And are now blackmailing me... I must say.. someday they will be in my door,begging for me to be there friend.. someday."
1,"thank you so much, as a person with social anxiety this is so reassuring and gives me courage"
1,Where you spying on me?
1,"Damn Kurzgesagt, that hurt....
I love all your videos and with sufficient dissociation I will eventually love this one too. 
That title drew me right in! I was beaming like a little kid on christmas morning. But ""You"" did not mean me.
Of course it didn't. Videos, articles, talks, etc. These are never directed at oddly specific outliers. Their effectiveness is in the opposite.

Time time time. What about (increasing) social anxiety mixed with introversion and a dash of hypersensitivity? Those are my biggest impediments.
Alcohol is a bigger one still. Everyone's life hack. A shortcut to fun! Once their drinking starts, my timer starts. 2 hours is the absolute max. 
By then their shifted formants have me twitching so bad I am forced to flee. The ensuing panic attack is not a great friend making tool. 

Also, concerts and (especially) raves are this introverts life hack. Huge crowds of different energies, all directed by a dominant central force.
This puts me in a unique position, where I can move freely among what is normally a threat to be avoided at all costs. Boy do I bask in that glitchy bliss.
Interaction still won't run due to missing dependencies and broken packages. That's okay. We'd need to get out of the area of influence for that.

* Shout out to all whose social muscle shriveled up in long exposure to pandemic Zero G."
1,i have all the time it's people who get worse and worse through the years
1,I had a hard time making friends in middle and high school. Now that I’m in collage I have so many friends. Even talking to girls has become so easy. High school is definitely not it
1,Man am I happy to have taken the time to call up two of my friends just before I watched this. I would've felt very called out if I hadn't.
2,as always a video that will not help millions but billions ! thank you !
2,Reading the comment I notice how lucky I am to have friends that I see quite frequently. Good luck to all of you guys. And nice video as per usual !
1,STOP DOING LIFE ADVICE THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS CHANNEL IS FOR!! THIS IS JUST OPINION!!
2,"I'm looking for friends who are responsible, honest, friendly and not judgemental. If you are interested you can feel free to reply. Ideally I'm looking for eventual close friends. Thanks for reading."
1,This video just sounds like generation war propaganda and ignores people with Social Anxiety.
2,Fr just said “No friends pleading_face?”
1,"Can't wait to listen to this. I have major social anxiety and I feel lonely all the time. I'm unable to connect to people because I overthink every single relation I have and I always feel like I'm a burden. Thank you for shining a light of this issue Kurzgesagt,"

1,"I literally can not use any advice from this video, but I appreciate that it includes a fat person. I like being represented."
0,I NEEDED THIS SO BAD
1,I'm just gonna watch it and imagine myself doing it but actually I'm in my bedroom lying on my bed doing nothing. I don't have any interest in doing this. At least i could imagine it.  Nothing went wrong in my imagination at least.
1,My biggest struggle is working graveyard shifts. It's the only option to help me get through school in the industry I want to pursue. It's hard to socialize expressionless_face
1,I’ve been dealing with loneliness ever since I was born and especially ever since my dad passed away and I’m only 10 years old.What I’m trying to say is that I really appreciate you making this video.
1,Idk why but making friends in college is quite hard. We as student attend class but teachers are like shut up and listen to my lectures. And its hard to converse with other people. And due to our limited time break between each class we have to move on and repeat the process. I'm not saying it's impossible to make friends but very difficult than it should be. Especially in cities like NYC. People keep to themselves which makes the opportunities small. I do hope I can meet more worthy friends. Best of luck everyone!
1,"Thanks Kurzgesagt; this is great advice even for ""olds"". I'm over 40 with small kids, and keeping friends (never mind even making new ones) has been a real struggle, even since the before-pandemic times."
1,"I was betrayed by my freinds today . 
It feels horrible but i will live without them"
1,"I've always been highly social. Not extroverted, mind you. People exhaust me. However, I'm also quite the insomniac, so being social helps me sleep. I've been able to make friends no matter where I go.
When I was in the military, it took me 20 minutes to walk 100' to my desk because people kept stopping me to chat. When I finally sat down, my team lead got up from her desk, looked me square in the eye, and said, ""How do you do that?""
""How do I do what? You need to be more specific, cause I do a lot of things.""
""How do you make friends?""
Her and I had been friends for a couple years at this point, so I found the question kinda strange. However, I realized that what she was asking was, ""How do you talk to people?"" I sat down with her and ran her through the basics of small talk and how to encourage the other person to carry the conversation. How to get people to talk about anything. How to present yourself when speaking to someone else to show them that you're interested in what they have to say, which just feeds into their desire to talk.
She did end up making a few new friends, and a boyfriend, after that. I'm not gonna say I worked a miracle or something, cause she already had a number of friends, but I think she wanted ones that she doesn't work with, and there's nothing wrong with that."
2,thanks.
2,Really nice video Kurzgesagt!
1,Damn dude; thanks for this. I think all of us needed it.
1,This video proves Kurzgesagt is human.

2,As brilliant as always. Thanks Kurzgesagt
1,"finally, a personalised guide just tailor-made for me."
1,"this is such a heartwarming video, it made me cry.
this hits deep in the feelings of so so many people."
2,This channel always breaks the mold with excellent topics engaging content and a pleasant voice explaining like a boss. Love this channel
1,I feel like im always organizing things and keeping our friend groups alive amd when I gave up the friend group faded away
1,Having this recommended to me makes me feel called out smiling_face_with_tear

1,Making friends is so hard. I'm  already horrible at it but add in that I'm picky when it comes to who I can be around for extended periods of time and it becomes 10x more difficult

1,"Thank you for covering people who may have many acquantances but few or no close friends, I have felt like this describes me for a while and have definitely felt loneliness from it."
2,I love this videos.
1,"One very nice thing this video says, shy people and introverts is not the same. I am an introvert but not very shy, I can be very outgoing around familiar people or when I want to be friends with someone."
2,"Thanks for the tutorial but I’ve committed various war crimes, so it’s kind of hard to make friends."
1,Uncle Rey :/

2,wow dont at me like this

1,This is a good video for people going back to school!
1,"Woah, as an almost hermit who likes food that tastes like pepper spray I have to say I'm slightly offended"
1,"Thanks Kurzgesagt, I genuinely needed this."
1,"Thank you, Kurzgesagt. I couldn’t have asked for a better birthday present from you! This is a subject that I feel has hounded me all my life. Despite having come to a lot of these conclusions on my own, it feels relieving to have them voiced out in the simple yet educational way only you can. I hope to start taking them to heart and not letting my fears hold me from the reality I want for myself. May we all find the friends we seek, and may we all richen each other’s lives though it."
1,Now I can see clearly why I don't want friends anymore
1,ngl made me cry but in a good way?
1,"Wow, this couldn't be more relevant to me than ever. I just started reaching out through board games. I'm so clueless with other avenues. Hope this will work. But primarily I just loves the hobby but nice thing about it is the social interaction."
1,"TLDR :
DON'T BE SOFT, GET OUT THERE AND MEET PEOPLE"
1,"I just need to vent, I used to have such a good group of friends but recently we split up. We were pretty small just 4 of us. One of us started flaking out on hanging out with us to hang out with his gf. And she’s springing red flags all over the place. I think the only reason he wants to hang out with her is cause he’s never felt that connection with a girl before. Then slowly after another left. I’ve known him for 5 years now and I figured that it would be the best bet to start hanging out with the other group. But it kinda sucked they were all I say this in the nicest way possible no lifers. They spent all the time they hung out barely talking just on there phones playing games on a switch or their phones. And there clearly un healthy not getting exercise anything like that. And I used to play foot ball (soccer) with him. And he’s pretty much stopped playing completely and it sucks to see him try to fit in with a crowd that shouldn’t be looked up to. And I’ve tried fitting in and starting actual conversations but they are not devoted at all. So tomorrow I’m planning on just giving up. And my other friend he’s started hanging out with other people. They are chill ngl. But you know when sometimes you just kind of end up finding someone boring or whatever that’s kind of it for me. There all really nice, one of them I’ve played football with quite a bit. But idk it’s just not the same. And it’s been so long idk how to find new friends or people to hang out with"
1,I have been suffering from feeling disconnected for a while especially since covid. Genuinely thought it was me and my own personality not being what people wanted but it’s a soothing hearing this and understanding I’m not alone or losing my mind. Thank you for helping us connect and/or to reconnect.
1,kurzgesagt how come no matter how hard I try I still can't seem to make friends? it depresses that no one wants to be my friend is it even possible to fix that?
2,"I'm not lonely, I have a family and friends and a great job."
1,"I have a hard time to communicate and express my personal feelings or opinion with my classmates, its mostly because of the language barrier, i stutter and stop midway in sentences most of the time, and its embarrassing cuz no im not somw generic tranfer student, but im having a hard time with my own language which is pilipino since i mostly communicate in English online,, real embarrassing but i dont have the motivation to actually learn since i have no interest in it grinning_face_with_sweat"
1,"Sad fact, I almost knew the content of this video even before watching it. I am living exactly through this."

2,i love your video red_heart
1,Thanks for giving such stupendous information shamrock

1,"Using this for my Social Emotional Middle school class, great work!"
2,I don’t like how this is in my recommendation
1,"The problem i am facing is time. I right now have no time. My work forces me to do nothing else during the day, and we now have to few people at work, so i have to work every day, from  am to  pm. This leaves me sleeping the rest of the day. Also, i live on the country side, outside of town, and i get the buss to work. So even if i have a free day of, i am so far away from civalisation, there is no economic way for me to spend time away from home. And i can't move from where i am right now. I am whit my mom (i pay rent) and i am the only one whit the capacity to work as a carpenter, to finnish building the balcony, cutting wood logs, preparing for a chicken coop sometime next year, and a outdoors stone oven. All of these things have to be done before i can even move out, as they are my persenal responsebility. And building these things are one of my greate joys in life. But i can't do any if them because i work so dam mutch. Sure i will get paid good, but i don't realy care for money right now. I have saved up, but i also can't spend anything right now becouse i need save up for what the repares and inspection cost for my car will be, and money for gas (2,1€/L) for the material for the balcony, for food, for parking, for my subscriptions, for my equipment that i am paying of. I want to have relationship, i want to feel for other people. I also want time to fix my body. I can't quit my job, i love it and hate it. I know to mutch that makes me ireplaceble. asking for higher pay is not gonna help, trust me. I am stuck between a rock and a mountain."
1,Solarpunk video or Bill Gates won't allow you?
1,KURZGESAGT IN A NUTSHELL MAKING MORE VIDEO I AM WATCHING YOUR VIDEO EVERYDAY
2,I have no friends and nobody plays with mecrying_facecrying_facecrying_facecrying_facecrying_facecrying_face
1,Thank you for making this before school starts
1,bruh :/ why is kurzgesagt making a video about me?
1,No I don’t think I will
1,"I'm only watching this video because it's by Kurzgesagt, not because I'm lonely"
1,"what a beautiful video, perfect for my first day at university !"
1,"I am hoping that someone can help me with a problem not adressed in this video.
The thing is that I can make friendships very easily but talking to people costs so much effort and energy for me that talking to a person for an hour is almost an unreachable goal because the sheer amount of energy it costs for me to do that is just enormous. The worst thing is that this even happens when talking to my parents for example. Does this sound relatable to anyone at all?"
1,I need to start doing more shit and less doing nothing
2,"I would like to read more about friends, is there any book suggestions smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes"
1,Bro who’s selling my personal data to YouTube
2,Kurzgesagt did the impossible: advice on how to make friends that is genuinely helpful
1,"I've always had a small friend group.  As an introvert I find it stressful to keep too many friendship plates spinning, and that's all fine.  But the military adage applies:  2 is 1, and 1 is none.  As I (and we) get older and weather forces like Covid, losing a romantic relationship, friends taking the opposite kids/no-kids path, and shifting a career toward being more solo, attrition can really whittle the numbers down before you know it.

I wish I'd prioritized friendship-maintenance earlier, but I strongly encourage everyone to not hesitate to spin old friendships back up again.  It may still feel a little awkward but much less so than starting from scratch, and you'll likely find that they've missed you and need it as much as you do!"
1,"Sounds stupid but this video is extremely true, and I’ve gone through the roller coaster of every aspect of this video, if I hadn’t already realised this video would have lit the fire to be more proactive"
1,"Dam, this hits me on a personal level"
1,This really was a beautiful video. This channel is soemthing special for sure. I've been watching ever since 3 ways to destroy the universe
1,"It’s the start of a new academic year for me and I had my first workgroup today. I have no connection with my fellow students, I haven’t spoken to anyone. I want to talk about my subjects with someone who knows something about it aswell but I just can’t make a connection with anyone. When I don’t know something and want to ask someone it stings to have nobody who I can ask or is suffering with me. I knew that law students are not my type of people but I hoped there’d be at least one likeminded person there."
1,"When did this channel go from theoretical science to ""School of Life"" bullshit?"
1,I’m planning on buy a duck shirt soon
1,Selling merch and disguising it as self help is as genius as it is predatory.
1,"bro, isn't this a german channel, how did you forget about central europe and put the central european countries in the surrounding parts of europe, HOW IN GODS NAME IS GERMANY IN WESTERN EUROPE? SINCE THE HELL WHEN IS CZECHIA IN EASTERN EUROPE??? HOW???"
0,"If someone can tell me this is not just the social version of, ""just stop being poor,"" ill give it a shot."
2,Can I be your friend?
1,I feel emotionally targeted
1,"Once a year, Kurzgesagt releases a video to help us, and I realized, they use the „Lonliness“ soundtrack everytime (or a variation of it)"
1,"Everyone seems to know that tik tok is harmful, yet we just let our kids use it. its like watching 9 year olds smoke cigarettes"
1,I have five or six friends but I don't see them out that long I only see them in one to three classes
1,My grandma was told a couple days ago by doctors that she has 4-6 months left to live she has stage 4 cancer. She has family living with her so she doesnt feel alone and well it's just Idk feeling helpless
1,The fact that this trend is now really saying a lot about the general audience of the internet. Loneliness in one's own family.
1,I’m alone but not lonely plus idc about people I’ll never see them ever again in life. My friends are the digits in my bank.
1,Wokeage in the chat xqcL
1,"I basically don't like people, probably due to having bern bullied right through my childhood. I guess that why I don't make friends?"
2,"Great, now do one on dating in your 30s..."
2,"How to finds friends that genuine likes you? because the only friends that contact me those days only contact me when they need me or want money, and I'm proud to say that I always say NO"
1,"I will say, teens don’t have many parties anymore. We only have small little parties because morons always call the cops"
1,This video is useless for anyone who isn't neurotypical
2,Best thing to find really good friends as an adult is either at work or when signing up for some sort of degree etc.
1,I can’t express how perfectly timed this video came out
2,Wish it was this easy.
1,"I don't want to have friends, but i do feel lonely and feel abandoned in my class. It's hard xd, i can't choose. I'm akward, boring, and a silent person. And people just used me as a back up friend, when their actual friend is available for them, they just left me alone, No invitations and talks, bruh. But i don't feel that's a problem although i find that is a problem, Because i'd feel lonely and abandoned but at the same time i'd rather to be alonedizzy. I want to have friends, but i'd feel uncomfortable with peopledisappointed_face. So when i got an invitation to a party, i would feel there's no point to go because i would be abandoned in crowd i and i i'm just going to waste my time, and when i tried to talk people's faces would like asking ""You're think you're cool?"" And laugh for sympathy and perhaps talks to me a little bit and left me alonebroken_heart"
0,Weird how many of us are equally lonely
2,A few real friends are better than a lot of fake ones
1,"I’m watching this video because I have no friends, who tf am I gunna buy those pins for? face_with_tears_of_joy"
1,I feel like 'dust off your space marines' was directed explicitly at me.
1,Crazy how some uploads come at the time you need them the most
2,What about if you just don’t like people in general how can I get people to stop being friend with me ?
1,"Do you ever feel like your friends don't care about you? And then you go out and they laugh at all your jokes, you're talking about your lives, and then you go home, overthink, and then believe none of your friends actually care about you?"
1,OK what happened to your science or space team?
2,"Aight, this gon' be good."
1,"Sponsored by the Bill and Melinda gates foundation, y'know, the people who helped shut down the world."
1,Could you please make a video only explaining what chemical energy is?
1,"Who to call for comfort

*Right now it's just my diary as i even made my therapist mad lol**"
1,"""And there are plenty of people who would be so happy to have YOU in their life,"" says Kurzgesagt Guy

And immediately I burst into tears. Not like I needed the moisture to stay inside me or anything. No problem. 

(On a more serious note, thank you Kurzgesagt team. I'll give it a shot and see how it goes. Thank you red_heart)"
1,Everyone says no to going outside or hanging out. There is nothing i can actually do.
1,The next video I would hope for is how to make a girlfriend
2,Anyone want to be friends? :D
1,"People *are* trash, though."
1,"I'm 26 years old and unemployed. Because my friends are have jobs and working, i feel that i'm embarrassed to meet my friends so i usually feel very lonely."
1,"90% of life is showing up
The other 10% is other people showing up"
1,Kurzgesagt knows what videos get most videos now don't they
2,Friends are a burden! A responsibility. A time waste. Why do you need friends? To lend them money? To listen to their stories? To help them solve their problems? One get wisdom instead of friends. And if you need somebody to talk to - get yourself a hamster!
1,"I needed this video today more than never, thanks!"
1,Beat thing I found in the Internet is your channel.heart_suit
1,*Any other person giving this advice I would dismiss but there's something about this narrator*
1,"Legit don't have any friends, thought things would be different once I started University but nope it didn't change a thing. Didn't help that everyone already knew each other except for me.
Doesn't help that the way our culture is here the only way really to meet someone is to go drinking on weekends so if you don't like that you are realistically not going to meet anyone here and are just a social outcast.
I have really given it a shot however, didn't change anything and at this point I have been alone for so long that I don't feel comfortable walking to a complete stranger and just going wassup nor do I know how to start a conversation at this point.
The last conversations I had were just at my job answering peoples questions and charging them the entrance fee which is not really a way to make friends since people stop at the museum like maximum 3 hours but average is about 1 hour and 30 mins a lot like 40 mins as well"
2,"For the type A personalities out there, it’s worth treating friendships as just as important as work or health. Not many do that, but those who do are certain it’s the right move."
1,Look for pubs
1,"I swear to God I was just thinking this exact thought, of how incredibly lonely I am, and then this pops up. Question is, do I watch it and make myself more sad? Or skip and find something that’s distracting?"
2,Well you didn’t have to call me out like this…
1,"Hi I'm from Legazpi City, Albay, Philippines Is there anyone around my area that wanted to have a meet up?raising_handssmiling_face_with_smiling_eyesparty_popper

1,"Top Tip:

If you ARE a lonely secret Warhammer nerd, start referring to your head of state as ""The God Emperor"", respond to any scientific evidence for Aliens as ""Filthy Xenos Scum"", and if you have any Technical issues with computers or your car say you have ""Angered the Machine Spirit""

I guarantee you will soon meet a Colleague, Co-Worker,  Acquaintance or similar who is also a Secret Warhammer Nerd overjoyed to be able to have a conversation about ""Wiping out Xenos Scum"""
1,"Be aware!

1,Kurzgesagt meet up? That sounds like fun but i dont expect it in Egypt at all
1,"Friendship is temporary, glory of the Imperium is forever.

1,"I have a square head, am overweight, have 2 spots on my nose, have adhd and autism (not in terms so of learning- I go to a grammar school, just from socially). I am backbitten on all the time. I am slow. I am Asian. I am not allowed to and therefore don’t have a phone. Now tell me I can make friends."
2,You can't just stop attacking me directly can you Kurz?
1,Friends who ski together stay together
1,"""And then one day you find
Ten years have gone behind you
No-one told you when to run

1,"wow, that was exactly the opposite of what I needed alone on a tuesday evening. thanx for that."
1,today's the day i cried watching a Kurzgesagt vid. this such a low point.
1,"I'm 45, I've given up on the idea of having friends and that being lonely will be normal for me for the rest of my life"
1,"When I get lonely, I pet my imaginary cats. I got a 2nd imaginary cat because the 1st one was getting lonely when I wasn't home."
1,"Say, do you guys think you can talk about something revolving around psychological differences such as ADHD and/or Autism being portrayed in the media incorrectly? I know it'd be difficult to do, but I think it should be talked about at least once."

1,"I do wonder what are kurzgesagt throughs on more internet based relationships, especially with VR existing now, allowing for much closer interactions than before?"
1,the reason i love science and math and study more than  x eed  sylabbus for fifth  i lose friendship with people
1,"I didn't know how much I needed to hear this until I heard it. Thank you kurzgesagt, your channel has no doubt changed the world for the better."
1,Why are you targeting me.
1,"Mean while, my best fiend from college I found by going into an online chat room and asking who play's Yugioh. Everyone thought I was weird and stopped chatting with me except one person. Best friend made."
1,Oh man right in time as a freshmen in college.downcast_face_with_sweat
1,"Somehow this video is a comedy X D
""You have to spend time with people""
Well, working in shifts and on weekends and also with collegues who arent interested at all, you cant make friends X D
Somehow this is only a video for kids and teens.
As soon as you out of the teen age, and try to make friends, you are discarded as a ""creep"" and left alone X D
Already tried things, afternoon classes, trying to motivate collegues, even neighbours for a boardgame evening.
So I dont know which kind of fantasy world this video is coming from, but is surely isnt the reality im living in.
Just amusing, that I have found interdimensional cable tv streaming X D

Being in a class without saying much, makes oyu the target to bullies.
And because of that, you arent talking much, because it gives them only ammunition.
They look for everything they can use against use, and they will.
If the society (class) has decided that you are worthless and should be targeted to be driven out, you have lost. 
For the rest of your life.
Because you learn the truth: the entire society is against you and will only look for ways to exploit you.
People who are friendly, are only faking it, to get something from you and cause damage afterwards.
It is always that way"
0,"Why are you lonely?



Tiktok"
1,I was addicted to drugs and I've stopped 3 months ago I still feel very anxious and depressed I can't make any friends.
1,"I can't believe I'm wasting my time watching this, it's ok to have no friends, as long as you have subordinates."
1,This video is 2.5 years late but thanks :D
1,"Thank you Kurzgesagt, I really needed this video blue_heart"
1,Hmmm too hard thinking_facethinking_face
1,Its way more difficult when you are autistic. I love being alone 98% of the time and only need a small amount socializing but its very difficult to find this.
1,The problem is that i don't see the point of having friends :/ and i am bored in my life. Am too lazy to live my life ig
1,Video about a major issue
2,I would love to make friends too.
1,Everyone is busy....
1,Let’s try it! I am so ready to make new friends! :D
1,"Some people believe they benefit more to be with friends rather than being alone . Unfortunately tho many people will form relationships not because they wanted to make friends or because they care about them or even because of a good heart , but because they want to find guillible and unsuspecting victims that will blindly trust them so they can easily take advantage of their kindness by manipulating them , scamming them , deceiving them , stealing from them and in the end they either ending up hurting them both emotionally and physically or worse by getting them involved into some serious trouble that will cost them very much . If you think about this loneliness might not be so bad after all since at least you'll both be safe and survive that way . In hostile enviroments if anything you'll be better off being solitary instead of joining a group of people that will cause you severe harm or even worse ."
2,I would do anything to have friends
1,"May well be the most needed video in the world right now. 
WELL DONE!"
2,Great video!
1,"My parents recently had to leave town for a family emergency, so I literally have zero social interaction outside of school. Admittedly I would certainly like friends, but have absolutely no idea where to start. Probably due to the fact that being introverted means I honestly don't care one way or the other whether I spend a holiday weekend binge reading or at some event.

Yeah I'm just clueless over here by my lonesome rolling_on_the_floor_laughing"
2,Wow I think I needed this..
1,"Amazing how easily we made friend when we were kids, now in adulthood... Well..."
1,This is beautiful
1,"introverts seeing this: yes *YES* 












what do you mean im an introvert"
2,yay a video which i need /j
2, The more friends you have the harder it is too balance time between them. Which is why between different people it can seem like a friendship has ended while for another person it's they are busy with other friends.
1,"Finally, a tutorial"
1,One of the first
1,A grotesque political cult spread through a large network of friends of mine.  I now have 90% fewer friends. Never been happier with my friend situation.
1,"I think I have a number of individual friends, but I've just never found a solid friend group that I could hang out with :("
1,"this was so cute, i feel afraid for the adult life"
1,"Kurzestag:making meetup for 18+

1,"The thing about friendships is that the older you get the harder it seems to make natural connections. You graduate school, move to a new city, and you don't know anyone. This is a great video with solid examples for everyone out there, especially post-COVID. Best of luck to everyone out there."
1,"I've got the feeling this video would really strive well within the nerd-community.
Many watching, much views"
1,The simulation getting real specific today
1,"I'm an introvert. I have one friend, and she's my best friend and also happens to be my girlfriend. I often snuggle another girl behind her back but she doesn't mind cause we both cuddle with her. It's my cat."
1,"Yo, I'm eating chicken nuggets"
0,Hell naw i just hortas said its losing freinds time and lost all his freind by explode himself and dies so poggers
1,"I've recently had friends not talk to me because they have other important things. I have two senior friends that do Calculus during lunch and it's my favorite period. Not because it's a break period, but because they're there. However, they don't understand. Anyway, this video is going to help. Thank you Kurzgesagt."
1,"We are lonely because we have replaced Human interaction with technology. We need human touch, face to face conversation, and human connection both friendship and romance."
1,"If we go out with the sole motivation of increasing friends and social contacts, we are putting the cart before the horse.

If we go out to develop an interest or hobby and increase friends in the process,  then we develop friendships for life... QED"
2,"If you have more than a handful of friends, you have acquaintances, not friends."
1,the only real advice you need is to not be an autist and just pretend that you support whatever the current thing is
1,"It's so easy to find and make friends but it's really hard to stay and keep them as friend because I end up hating them and just cutting them out of my life. Longer I spend time with anyone, the more I want them gone."
1,"i'm so fucking lonely, even though i literally never get a second alone"
1,"I know you're watching this Alejandro, we miss you."
1,I was in a social crisis and this video savwd me. I don't know how to thank you
1,"I MISSED GOINNG OUT AND ABOUT. I WOULD NOT LET MYSELF BE CONFINED IN THE QUARTERS OF MY ROOM AGAIN! LIVE LIFE IN THE REAL WORLD! YAY!

FEEF FREE TO CNNECT GUYS!"
1,Would’ve needed this vid a while ago. Now I have a girlfriend who truly love me.
1,I will be soon to try this out
1,I did not know i needed this
1,"nah i prefer to skip all the work and sit in my room alone slowly rotting away, after finishing high school i have never, ever, seen anyone i know once in 2 years, if they don't want to call me or message me it's fine, i simply don't care about not having friends, i know some people online, never met them, it's fine like it is now, i have my routine of waking up, going to the gym for a bit, go to work for the whole day then go back home and play games, i don't like talking to people, especially to strangers. But i still don't understand how will that shorten my life"
1,"Hi everybody, what is your favorite topic?
Mine recently is space, I'm 21,M, and what to learn new things, you?"
1,"at a buffet, i personally sneak corndogs into the buffet so others can enjoy them. I hide 6 corndogs in my jacket pockets. it then, is a joy for me to see other patrons of the establishment eat my corndogs thinking they were part of the buffet."
1,Very timely discussion
0, I guess I will just die early woman_shrugging
1,They have done it again
1,Finally I've been waiting for this
1,"Due to living in a small-ass rural town and having a more introverted nature it can be hard to find friends here. I've found that social VR has been a really nice alternative for me, and my social skills have gone up like crazy due to it."
1,"Easier said than done. The vast majority of people are so broken they don't even try anymore to form relationships which means most people won't even put in their part of the work. I got tired of doing it all. So I say no reason to have any friends because the vast majority will not do their part. I've been with my partner for over 15 years. I have no problem having long-term loving relationships, but friendships have been completely impossible because the state most people are in."
2,"Im 16, have no friends nor had for a long time."
1,"I just got back to uni and it's finally not online anymore. Making new friends is almost too easy now. Add that to the fact that I'm finally back in my city where all of my previous friends live. I'm having a blast and almost everyday I feel happy.

I've realized it's very easy to make friends if you are a bit proactive. Want someone to talk to you? Ask them about their hair, or a piece of clothing they are wearing you like (btw men, don't be an idiot and tell a girl ""I like your collar"") or maybe instead of a piece of clothing ask about the color combo they are wearing, anything that interested you really."
1,"Right, all I have to do to regain my lost relationships is spend time, the lack of said resource being the reason they were lost in the first place.

A revelation indeed."
1,Great video can you make please video about evolucion
2,This video was helpful! Thanks
1,"recently i started college and so did my high school friend group. they left and now they’re all in the same uni pursuing a stem related major, while i am still in our city doing art related. It’s been hard to rewire my mind to seek new friends and to not compare myself to my peers here that have a multitude of friends. i miss my high school friends a lot and i think the comfort of having them as friends is becoming a burden to my social life at college. but this video has made me realize it’s ok for me to only have a one or two friends here and it’s not quantity that matters it’s quality."
1,Hello my good sir do you still have that frog i sent awhile back
1,"I'm definitely trying to make good friends, but just ig I haven't found anyone who will not be in toxic friendship with me or just using me.
I always try to look if I could ever find the custom one made for me, but ig that's kind of childish and I'll be stuck with myself all life long ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
1,"It's not that I don't know how to get friends, it's about that I do not want to."
1,"Only Kurzgesagt can make ""vibe"" sound like a scientific word"
1,"19 seconds fast sheesh

Also we know"
1,"All you need is one good friend. Don't force yourself to have multiple friends, especially if you're introverted. You'll be drained dry and hate your life."
1,"Yeah, with each video you put out, the more you prove how disconnected you are with reality. The reality is that more and more people have no time or money to afford going anywhere or doing anything after work.

You also didn't talk about how capitalism's goals are at complete odds with having a social life or having hobbies that make the world a better place. You could have then made a call for action about RBE and how our economic system plays a huge part in your lack of friends.

Or you could have just made a 15 second video saying ""step 1: have money and free time. If you don't have either, just keep being a good little worker drone who props up our broken society"""
2,Anyone in London that wants to be my friend?
1,i mean friends would be nice but its just too much of a hassle and i have too much check boxes solo queue is life
2,"Way to call me out lol, but thanks."
1,"Having friends not from work after college is mostly meeting once or twice a year: "" Hey guys,I miss you, let's get together and do something!"" "" Yes! I'm free Saturday  November 19th!"" "" Perfect, see you guys in two months!"""
1,"After joining the marine corps I lost all the friends I had in high school besides one, on leaving the Marines I'm now experiencing the same thing again, I moved states. Trying hard tho."
1,How oddly well-timed. Loneliness seems to be my largest source of grief currently.
1,"Turning up to stuff is really important. If you like the place, keep turning up, without fail. If you don't, keep trying other activities and groups. I'm bloody useless, and still ended up with a good amount of friends this way. Took a while but worked!"
1,I just started looking for some friends last week. I'm using a dating app that allows you to find new friends. It's going really good. Funny how this video came along at just this time I my life smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes
0,I don't need friends. They disappoint me.
2,I love being alone. I got all of my stress from ex friends. I will never allow anyone as friend again.
0,I don't need friends. I want the literal truth
1,""" A friend to all is a friend to none"" 
- Aristotle

I've made a lot of group of friends with very different genres

""Same feather flocks together""

Now Im thinking that I do not really know myself and cant define my distinction among others its like having multiple personalities and identities. I dont want to be alone someday, I do hope that I wont be lonely and I also wish the same thing for the others that relates to my story."

i get it, you're so clever you know me -- congratulations."
2,"Too few friends, too few friends, too few friends no no no"

1,the yt recommended is hitting a bit too close to home
2,Literally just moved to New Orleans and have been having this problem. Hopefully this helps!
1,Thank you Kurzgesagt for posting this. I really needed something on this topic and I appreciate this information.
1,"This kinda give me a positive look since I am having friendship problem at the moment.I was reconnecting with old friend and it was going well but yesterday I forget it was her birthday and I apologize and try to make it up to her but she just say ""it's fine "" and go silence on me which kinda make stressed because im working whole week and she is a student at moment so our schedule and times already make this connection harder than it is.Gonna try to be more patient with the issue hopefully we can stay connected"
1,"""You still play overwatch"""
1,"This was the most anticipated episode by far since you announced that you were going to do a follow up several years earlier.

It's so worth it btw. I moved back to the US after so many years of discomfort in my own country, due to my upbringing that also took place in the US and the giant mismatch between the two cultures, to go to college. And I am currently facing this problem right now, because it seems that the constant exposure to all of the problems that I had faced turned me from the unusually hyper boy in class into a horribly unmotivated and unenergized -manchild- adut. In addition tk this, the COVID situation that, quoting and paraphrasing another commenter, ""destroyed my second social ring"" seems to have done so much more damage to me than I thought it did.

Anyways, I don't know what'll happen to me, but good luck you guys."
1, Shoutout to Kurzgesagt for the Sade CD <3
1,how to make friends and influence people. now where did I hear that before?
2,Thank you for making this video
1,"I'm honestly not sure if I've experienced traditional loneliness.  I miss intimacy (sex) when I'm not seeing anyone, and at times I reflect on how useful my old group chats were for asking questions and figuring things out (but that feels sorta like I don't care about the actual people, just the utility of how they can help me).  At no point have I ever been like ""I wish I could go do X activity with someone"" unless it was with the end-goal of sex or a date-like experience; I've even skipped out on friend get-togethers at times because it dawned on me ""wait, what's even the point of this?  it's stressful to get things for this and plan things, it's not helping me personally, and there's zero chance of anything sexual happening because duh it's a friend thing"".

Expanding on this, I've slowly stopped reaching out to people / responding as much (essentially, slowly unfriending people) because I've (unfortunately) realized too late the function of friends is ultimately to network (jobs, relationships) and this wasn't happening with any of my old friend groups (quite literally we just hung out, which I took too long to realize I didn't care about at all).  So that's where this video does come in lol -- I'll need to start making new friends so I can use it for what it's apparently actually used for.  It's one of those things nobody tells you as a kid but as an adult you're like ""oh, I get it now""."
1,"""You supposed to have friends""
""There is scientific proof that it will give you problems""
""STOP HAVING FUN"""
2,What's more important education of friends?
1,"as a person with less than even prime number of friends, i feel this video is just made for me."
1,"On Today's Episode of ""The Internet Calls You Maidenless and to Go Touch Grass"""
1,"Thank you so much Kurzgesagy, this couldn't have come at a better time. 
I've started falling down the slippery slope of distancing myself from people, and this has been a great reminder that yes, I do need connection, and I love my friends lol."
1,"First watching all of evangelion for the first time and now this, I can't handle all of this forced introspectionloudly_crying_face"
1,"One of the first lines of the video is that Singularity or lack of association can lead to disease and a shorter life. 
May we explore this? 
What disease may you attain from lonely?
How would lonely remove years from your life?"
2,"Pfft please. People are all terrible, I’m good.  On that. I’m down to 2 friends and the friendships have been declining for years. I just truly hate other humans."
1,the fact that the BGM is called loneliness makes it so much better
2,I touched grass and no friends were made.
1,"So you die faster if you're lonely. Sure man sure what about eating unhealthy food? It's okay to be lonely because people can be introvert and extrovert. I myself am lonely, but that doesn't make me sad or depressed. I'm just quiet and I get bored easily, but that, like everything else, can be fixed if I do things which makes me happy and what I enjoy. Also, online friends exist too. Say, playing your favorite game with someone who has positive energy is also good."
1,Its even harder to prioritize friends when you're an introvert.
0,Crap.. can't I just order friends from Wish? This gonna be hard
2,thanks for making me cry during my lunch break. I miss a handful of people I've been wanting to contact recently.  Yay social anxiety.
2,"I from Russia, who want me?"
1,"Some people just don't have anything to provide to others around them, so no one interested to stay around. Sometimes you are bored with yourself, so can't expect people to not be bored with you lol."
1,"I have been watching Kurzgesagt videos for years, and I just have to say how much I love these videos that talk about the importance of personal health. I love the more ridiculous videos about the Earth turning to gold and the various scientific topics about anything from various species of ants to supermassive black holes, but I truly appreciate these videos about the things I can do to just be a better person, both as an individual and a member of society. It is hard not to feel alone, especially in the last two years. Thank you so much for years of amazing quality content that really does help make the world a better place."
1,Please make this video in Hindi

1,"Holy smokes, Kurzgesagt! There is some fantastic perspective and ideas in here, and I learned so much!! I highly appreciate this because as a professional networker and business owner, I am learning everything I possibly can about relationships.

I’ll also add, a great way to connect with people you don’t relate to (which is 99% of people in my case, I’m a bit of an anomaly and I’m okay with that) is by using stories you’ve heard from other people.

Just the other day, I met a 7-Eleven employee who was wearing a hijab, the hair cover that married Muslim women wear. I said, “I love the color of your hijab!” And lo and behold, she was so impressed by the fact that I knew what that was (as I’m not a practicing Muslim nor ethnically south Asian)! It’s that internal lingo. She later told me she’s from Pakistan, and we had a super positive interaction.

But the only reason I knew what a hijab was was because of a couple from Bangladesh I had met several months ago, also practicing Muslims, and I cared enough to ask them about their beliefs, mostly out of curiosity.

Anyway, I also love how you said that the “risk is worth the reward”, because yes, I have that fear of rejection just like everyone else, and while most interactions probably won’t result in a lifelong friendship, the ones that do are absolutely precious. I have a few like that, and wouldn’t trade them for the world."

0,"Meh, being lonely is easier."
2,podcasts are popular because they're like a surrogate for having friends
1,"Thanks Kurzgesagt, I have been feeling extremely lonely since the lockdown back in 2020. And i just realised how lonely i was even before it but I just never realised it, after watching this video i do feel a bit empowered but I think you missed a major part of the problem.
I think a fair share of people are very meticulous with whom they befriend (like me) and are very careful and slow with new connections, which gives them the illusion of loneliness (maybe i am in one). I would also appreciate if you guys also spoke about how to cut off some friendships which arent working or are detremental to you."

1,"I Don't Usually Comment But, Today's Animation Was Cute"
2,"I don’t like friends, I don’t want friends, “friends” like you as long as you are beneath them, at least as long as they think you are beneath them, when they sense you are growing at a higher rate than them, they will do everything in their power to weigh you down to their level."

1,"I want to leave a comment about my experiences

I have often treated my friends poorly, not intentionally but just because I never really learned how to treat friends when I was younger. I was and still am a very cowardly and timid person as a child, and I felt like I could never connect with people, so I never went to events to learn how to talk with people in a kind way. After being told that I had done some pretty awful shit to my friends and treated them pretty rough, I began thinking I didn’t need friends. It felt like I either always hurt people or I couldn’t make friends in the first place, and considering I’m the person who always stayed home playing video games, I figured I was entertained enough to not have them. Friends always felt optional to me, and I always thought you couldn’t really have true best friends because they’d eventually ditch you. All in all though, just thanks for this video. I really needed it"

1,"•	Make friends
o	The most important principle for making friends is to spend time with people in the real world.
o	Friendships can develop within weeks but take a few months to develop from a casual friendship to a close relationship.
	The most determining factor being time invested and the quality of the interactions.
	Look for people you have things in common with and who are open to new relationships.
•	Examine what kind of person you are!
o	Open up, care and share.
	Its important to not overshare.
	To get something, it helps to convince yourself that you want it less than you do.
	Do things for yourself and enjoy them but look out for opportunities and take invitations.
o	Why we don’t have friends.
	Most people don’t prioritize friendships nearly enough.
	Maintaining friendships demands regular energy and attention.
o	Prioritize friendships"
1,"After a horrible accident which caused me my both of my legs, I was abandoned and left alone by the so called ""friends"", now after 7 years after the accident I still don't get comfortable of the idea of friendship. I believe I will remain lonely after my parents die. For me there is nothing like friendship."
1,Never clicked on a video so fast
1,I’ve never been so called out in my entire life. This really shows my social skills.
1,This video is going to do a lot of good

1,My favourite part of this video is the Funkadelic poster in the background along with Bootsy's Space Bass... It was unexpected and made the video resonate even more with me
1,why are the people in the video  watering a  cactus
1,I always thought it was weird how big my friendship group is for someone in their thirties. Looking back we had one guy who put in a huge amount of effort to making sure everyone kept hanging out. Now we're all close like family and I know no matter what happens we'll all be there for each other. If you're in your early 20s be that guy. Put in the effort. Your future self will thank you.

2,"Super poignant vid. Recently lost all my friends a few months back and have been on this journey. People are so much easier to be friends with than I ever thought, it’s just the beginning part that’s the toughest"
0,so it’s all my fault that i have no friends…
1,"I know the pandemic hit me very hard since I was just entering a new stage of my life and had pretty much distanced myself from any friends I had before covid started. My saving grace was a chat platform I messaged random people from my classes with, and the two that responded are the best friends I could ever ask for. Now I just have to figure out how to do that without a screen. I’m just glad I’m not the only awkward one afraid of rejection :)"
1,"Friends are just one of many possible social connections.
I am used to not having many friends, and I would rather be alone than getting drained by superficial social activities with people who I don't connect deeply with. 
However, I do enjoy going out frequently to get some human interactions (e.g. with shopkeepers) or simply people-watching to get some ""human energy""."

1,This video makes my soul angry and I want to die
1," man jurassic duck, where do we get these puns from"
1,"Money. The problem is money. To reach your friend, you need money to pay for transport. To reach your friend in movie theater you need money to pay for the tickets. To reach your friend in a restaurant, you need money to pay for food. If you do not have any problem with money or family to feed on, it will be much easy to reach out and make new friends.

As Maslow law said, physocological needs and safety needs first. Then we can talk about social needs. The dilema of this is we have a limited time even to secure a minimum life for our needs. Even at this time, price go up significantly, wage only up a little, thinking of that is already makes a headache."
2,Loved the video...
2,Wow calling people out like thatpensive_face

1,"How many of your long lost friends thought of you while watching this video, how may did you think about. Maybe its time you reach out."

1," ""...loneliness is highest among young people""

Then why are people under 18 being excluded from the meetup?

Two of my best friends when I was 12 were adults who shared my interests in geology, paleontology and astronomy. I'm 37 now and they're still good friends. I met another of my current closest adult friends when I was in my 20's and he was 11. Now he has a geology degree and codes for Wolfram Alpha. One of my best friends right now is a 14 year old I go fossil hunting and play chess with.

To counteract the epidemic of youth loneliness we must make an effort to include them in our social circles. This meetup is a great idea but it needs to be open to all ages. Maybe there is a law or platform rule requiring youth exclusion but if that's the case and you're choosing to follow it then there should at least be a statement of protest."
2,"Y’all can’t just attack people like this, putting it in their recommendations lmao"
1,"There is 2 type of people in this context:
One that follows the advice
And the other that will create a robot to be their friend based on this

I'm definitely in the latter"
1,Kurzgesagt making me cry midday in the bathroom at work…again.
1,Hardest time is where your desperate to keep the friendship alive so you do a-lot of dumb stuff just for them to ignore you
2,Me as a 14 yr old game dev in singapore with no friends: well shit
0,I’m only 16 wtf
0,OK FINE ILL CHECK DISCORD
1,"Is it just me or are the people I lost touch with STILL my friends.
Life is busy, there are so many distractions! What is wrong with not getting in touch as much because of distance/wrong timings?
Its a shame but you can't keep in touch with people all the time."
2,"Wow, I actually needed this"
2,"Thank you very much beating_heart
This video is very helpful red_heart"
1,what about when youre the one always organising events but no one is bothering to organise events themselves?
1,"I love everything about the video I would only change one small bit of word choice. Instead of saying ""make them feel like you care"" say ""Show them how much you care."""
1,"Nah I think it's because I'm autistic, after like 8 years of my life I have finally made friends that feal like real friends. The thing is they're all neurodivergent just like me, my brain just cannot socialize with someone who is neurotypical."
1,"This is great.
I sat at my own lunch table for my first 3 months of high school. My friends from middle school went to different high schools. As an introvert, I felt nervous and anxious to interact with others. As sad as it sounds, it was alright. I had time to myself that I otherwise wouldn’t have had. I didn’t feel deprived or desperate for interaction. Over the years I did socialize more and felt more comfortable."
2,"Thanks for this video, like eating a delicious sandwidth."
1,This is so pure and wonderful! I cried. Thank you Kurzgesagt <3
1,"You cant see people especially kids gather on the middle highway, but you can see people gather in playground, public parks, cafe, square, school, library, market. Just imagine world with less highway road, it will be less carbon footprint and more friendship"
2,love your videos! always masterpieces fire
1,"I’m high functioning autistic and struggle to communicate on an emotional level. So making friends is incredibly difficult for me. I see other people chatting, getting to know each other in social settings and to me, it’s like they have a superpower or something. They might as well be shooting lasers out their eyes.

I have two, maybe three friends and I haven’t spoken to anyone in my family for nearly a decade. It also doesn’t help that I’m naturally reserved and very introverted.

Tl;dr mental health issues suck."
1,Thanks Kurzgesagt but nobody can fix my problem that is lacking vital social skills
1,"I just woke up, why you gotta be calling me out like this."
1,"To be honest, it's mainly just me clinging to the past and dealing with the worst of humanity (I work as a cashier) that drives me from putting myself out there and trying to make friends. I'm trying to get out of my comfort zone but it's hard when everybody treats you like shit because they're entitled douchebags."
2,Sorry but me no have friends
1,"I used to roll my eyes at the adults who would discourage phone usage as being detrimental to living. But… years after, it became mostly true. The way we treat our relationships with tech, or more rather, the way tech tries to form our relationship with it, is now a fight of addiction and moderation. It feels like the world hasn’t figured out how to dance the dance with how we live with this kind of technology and mindfulness yet."
2,Dream fans: *furiously taking notes*
1,The exact video I needed thanks !
1,"Once i was looking at all the star wars servers on gmod and i thought ""oh hey i like star trek"" so i went to a server and everyone there was the stereotypical cartoon nerd. Just straight up the nerd_face emoji. I did not know those were unironical lmao"
1,"This video is very needed for this generation, I see a lot of people my age and younger not mingling and trying to avoid interaction its scary"
1,The only potential friends I could make are all people who do activities that I either am against morally or have a very strong dislike for. Am I alone in thinking this?
1,Way to call me out
1,Wow it's almost as if the only thing lockdowns did was ruin people's lives since basically everyone still got it.
2,Having friends is a loss of time and energy. I have no friends and I'm fine with that.
1,"End of the vid is brutal
5 friends takin a pic, only the main 3 in the pic
Like damm bro you gonna leave out the 2 side guys"
1,"""introverts don't like spicy foods""

You underestimate my power!"
2,"For me, it's better to have decent friends than to have any friends at all. At least that's true for me, because knowing too much, having ""friends"" becomes almost unbearable and meaningless."
0,solution destroy your phone (it works)
2,this video makes me actually not want friends ever again
1,I Think the biggest impediment is shyness over time.
1,When time ran slower.....ouch. it hurts to hear that and know how true it is.
1,"Too many people are stuck on their phones, even people I like, I'd rather just be alone."
1,"Like the video a lot but there is one main thing u got wrong. If you are present in the classroom and barely talk u people aren't sympathetic to you. Nah they call you the ,""quiet kid"" and they all think your either, gay, a school shooter, or emo. I know this seems harsh but coming from a quiet kid this is the experience. and from my one other friend who was also a quiet kid, he had the same experience."
1,"I live in a strict country where most people are strict too, and I really have any irl friends only like 3 online that rarely even online :/ once a ~month~

1,wowserz  this really helped me face_blowing_a_kiss!!! will take these tips fro notice winking_face.
1,What if I'm not lonely with literally no friends but understand I objectively need people around me to live a fulfilling life as a social animal? How do you learn to want to have friends?
0,Damn why you got to do that to me bro
1,the worst thing is when u finally make a friend at but your conversations are like only 5 seconds long :( then they get bored of u
2,Your best friend has allways a fur . Humans can never be your best friend ......
1,"This only applies to social butterflies who lost some friends through no fault of their own. If you never had any real friends then you are just an introverted piece of  trash nobody wants. You can do everything in this video, go to every club, talk to all your dorm mates, but nobody will reciprocate you. Nobody wants a self-hating cynical boring introvert who is just more emotional drain for them. Everyone wants charismatic, energetic, funny witty guys to improve their lives, not playing therapist to a loser. They have their problems and they want to forget about them or find someone to solve them, not to be even more burdened by someone else's problems. Even if they agree to hang with you back, they only do it to feel better about themselves (haha, I helped you loser dork so you won't kill yourself, I am such a good person) or to get a schmuck to smooch money and favors off of. The best you can hope for is a group of introverted nerds who all mutually hate each other but still get along so they don't feel alone"
1,I just moved to a new city in August and the only person I know us my gf and like a 2 coworkers. I'm in a college town around the same age as students but I feel I have no way to meet new people. To sum it all up thanks

2,"Well it looks like we had the Loneliness 2 video, and the loneliness girl is not so lonley now. Hope that you can find friends too."
1,Could you make a video on Anti-Matter
1,It is not so much fear of rejection for me but I am convinced that I have little to offer to other people. Wether romantic relationships or friendships I just can't imagine that someone would actually want me. I am neither attractive nor interesting.
1,"It is so easy for many of you, all I know is work, there is no time for friends."
1,It's almost like there's a modern project to keep people atomized and intractably polarized.
1,bro i legit searched up bladee and this is the second video that popped up
2,I like how Kurzgesagt casually bounces between Black holes and Wiki How to making friends.
1,Half of the people on discord really need to see this
1,"cuz people only talk to popular people who dont care about them besides money - and the people who are talking to popular people are using them for their fame to get popular themselves

they might get rich or popular, but then they wonder why they are sad. repeat.

1,"I spent 30 months without a job, have the ""easiest"" job at a restaurant. The the main thing you need is self confidence. You don't need to friend everybody at work. But if people are friendly to you, and you give even the bare minimum effort you can give, you're already making huge progress than sitting in your room watching YouTube shorts.

1,Ok but what if I'm just unlikable and annoying and that's why I can't keep friends
2,"Wow, the title is on point slightly_smiling_facethumbs_up"
1,"I have 3 friends, 2 of which I barely ever communicate with, but who will always be friends no matter how much effort we put into the relationship.  I wouldn't mind some more casual friends, but as someone for whom social distancing is normal, that's not so easy.  I've considered looking for some local TTRPG groups, since I'm quite the nerd for that stuff, but I guess I have a bit of social anxiety, because interacting with people I don't know is pretty difficult for me."
1,"To be fair we're in 3 pandemics so its not advised to go out to parties and hang out. I'm immuno compromised so maybe its just me, but i def feel less alone with social media (but still lonely compared to before covid)"

1,"I personally think pa loneliness is not bad, people are too much slaves to other people, you have to in my opinion learn that being alone is also good"
1,In tired of hearing that many people don't have friends because of the pandemic. Lockdown literally only lasted like 3 months. What about all the people you knew before? You can't keep in touch with someone without seeing them? What kind of excuse is that? And after that things went back to normal pretty quickly.
1,Interesting that this video was first uploaded on the german yt channel
1,": ! Loneliness and a lack of social connection have significant negative impacts on individuals' health and well-being, with young people being particularly affected.
: busts_in_silhouette The most important principle of making friends is to regularly spend time with people in the real world, but many people don't prioritize friendships enough.
: mantelpiece_clock The underlying cause of having less connection than desired is almost always lack of time.
: sparkles Creating opportunities to spend time with others can lead to meaningful friendships and improve well-being, fun, and connectedness.

1,"Big cities give us the impression that we can carelessly sabotage our friendships if it selfishly benefits us. Friends are a dime a dozen and you can just get a new one. Just like the increasing divorce rate, there are many more scumbags nowadays…"

1,"Forget your ego, and text every acquaintance you have with an enthusiastic invitation to spend time together. Life is short, love shamelessly"
2,Heyy! Loved it! How good would it be if you guys had a podcast for this kind of video? Like youtube for science and podcast for emotional intelligence...
1,"I like that video a lot, but I disagree with one (small) bit of it : ""in the real world"".
It's really not a mandatory part, you -can- build relationships online and have them meaning something. I've barely felt affected by the pandemic because my closest social circle was mostly online, and spending time and doing activity with them really wasn't the hardest part. It does take time, reciprocal efforts and works much better through shared interests though, that is for sure."
1,that peter gabriel sledgehammer reference though
1,Kurzegesat you help a lot of people to learn more than you truly are a legend and always have been :)
2,Didn't need to be insulted like that... but good video anyways lol

2,Love how this channel slowly targeting me with their video recommendation.
2,After seeing what friends really do. I'm no interested in having none. Bye.
1,I lowkey cried during this. The flow of memories washed over me like there was no tomorrow. Loneliness drove me insane. Being alive and looking back on memeories make me wanna keep pushing even tho I lost my motivation. Sorry if this didn't sound right I was crying while typing.
1,"*Another helpful tip is establishing regularity. I think a lot of adult friendships fall into a “Let’s catch up once or twice a year whenever one of us feels like taking the huge initiative to contact the other,” when instead it could be “Let’s chat/grab dinner/play video games/etc every Friday/once a month/etc.” Having a regular thing that you can count on and look forward to does WONDERS in relieving your loneliness, not to mention your friendship and overall happiness.*"

1,How did you know?
0,Animation quality has gone to shit
1,"People don't want friends. They want someone to mooch on, to use for their benefit, to make themselves seem comparably better to others."
1,"I am an immigrant teenager from Ukraine living in the USA for more than 3 years.  During these 3 years, I found 0 friends, moreover, I don’t even communicate with anyone at school, because absolutely everything I touch is not interesting to me.  Everyone has a different outlook on life, everyone has different jokes, everyone has different tastes in music.  I am literally the opposite of everyone around me.  Every day is like the previous one, I'm always alone at lunch, because when I try to talk to someone this conversation lasts no longer than 10 minutes, then they lose interest in me. 

I can describe it as if you are a cameraman who shoots (sees) an interesting movie, but doesn't participate in it in any way, only observes."
1,"""How to get bitches"" thats what the world needs rn"
1,It's like this video was made for me
1,"This video hit home, this might get a bit long but I'll get into the context. Back in 2019, I started my first year of high school but things didn't last very long. Around halfway through the year I dropped out, not because I was doing bad academically, I had actually been first in my class, but because growing distance from all my friends disrupted my life, without getting into too much detail, already problem-ridden life. I made new friends pretty quickly, but all my old friends were the closest thing to a constant in my messy life, and I struggled to maintain the majority of my friendships with them because of the position I was in mentally at the time, so everything in my life became too much to handle. Fast forward 3 years later, I'm doing online school and starting to get things together, despite all the additional challenges that popped up along the way, but now I've lost contact with all my friends, and the only people I talk to are like 3 people I became friends with online during this time. It sucks being so distant from people, but as things get better for me and my life improves, maybe put some of the advice in this video to practice when meeting new people, and maybe even reconnecting with sum old ones."
1,"6 years before i was sad for not having a gf

1,This video made me fill up a large glass of wine
0,"Bro literally the moment i feeling lonely, kurzgesagt posts “why the fuck u lonely”"
1,"Thank you for making it clear that ""introvert ≠ shy""; not all of us introverts are shy (some of us can be uncomfortably bold at times). We just have different preferences for socializing (less noise, fewer people, shorter durations, etc). Something that helps me to maintain good friendships is to have regular reminders in my phone to text specific people once a week. I currently have three reminders in my phone to text various people very week or two. It's such a small thing, to send a text message, but it makes friendships better (the ones that are worth investing in).

I've had to let several friends go because they would never reach out and I didn't think one-sided friendships was desirable or even healthy; they just felt desperate and pitiful. So I stopped reaching out to those people and they never once got in touch with me to see how things are doing. That's how I know I made the right decision to stop reaching out to them. I then started making new friends, and my new friends are people who *do* regularly send me texts or interact with my stuff on social media.  I treasure those friendships; they're definitely worth the effort!"
1,hhhhhhhh pile_of_poopile_of_poopile_of_poopile_of_poopile_of_poopile_of_poo
1,2 weeks after I arranged therapy for myself for just this problem.
1,"as much as i appreciate what is being said in this video, i think making friends is not a matter of mere decision, it comes down to our psychological makeup. i think this is a stronger factor in friend making.  
ps: i find it interesting that over 4 million watched this video. just tells us so much"
1,as a student who left all of my friends at my old school to my new school after i moved i had a hard time making friends and i still am but this might be a little nudge for me to test. i will update later
1,my friend group lost the main person (they switched schools and became harder to talk to) but my best friend took over the role of group leader
0,"No, youre lonely! Im not lonly! If i were lonly i wouldnt have my best friends like my gunswinking_face"
1,I don't have an issue with having friends but I'm so socially awkward that this will probably be very very helpful anyways
1,"I have one friend I have had since second grade, but we barely talk anymore and we struggle to talk about anything together… I literally have no one  to talk and do anything with"
1,"I recently started wanting to meet more people and meet more people, get more friends, it has been a titanic effort and this came out just when i needed it the most"
1,"From the start of elementary, I had 3 very close friends and we always talked on the bus about our favorite TV show and sadly they stopped talking to me in like 4th grade because they made new friends but luckily had still had 1 best friend that stuck with me until 5th grade and that was when I was in a quarantine and after Covid 19 the whole online class had changed me and my friends relationship completely and I developed depression and social anxiety so I was a loner throughout all of 6th grade and what came worse for me was moving middle schools during summer break and that just made it a lot harder for me to make friends and currently no one is my friend I sit alone during lunch school is stressful and I hate homework I think I am failing math I hate orchestra and violin I just want someone to stick with me until the the end of middle school and they will never leave me behind"
2,"How many of us have them, friends! 
Friends we can depend on, friends!"
1,Where was this when I most needed it. I learnt it my way so its okay now
1,Kurzgesagt really be out here telling us we got no bitches.
1,Yess the awesome ”loneliness” tune is back in this video <3333 I has helped me a lot (cheesy i know)
1,"When I was growing up I had some decent friends not many but they were almost always there, when one wasn't another was. However everything changed when I moved away all those localized friends almost disappeared, slowly but did, those who had/have facebook (which I myself have all but stopped using as well, next to chat) slowly stopped updating their pages, few going so far as deleting them, same story with post secondary. Effectively the only friends I have left are those who I actually never saw in person but have had lively chats with over the phone (mostly skype or MSN mess when that was a thing), we know what each other look like and they are a wonderful group of people that I trust, HOWEVER this trust took YEARS not weeks or months so please for all things good don't take me words and talk to randoms online thinking they'll be a friend!

I'm all for the local meetups but please take care of doing so, many people will use this opportunity to abuse it, so seriously bring someone you know/trust to the meetup or at the very least let someone know where you are, follow common sense like don't meet up at night or close to night time, meet up at a public place like a coffee shop or a malls food court. I would love to meet new people and maybe make a new friend or 2 but personally I won't be partaking in this, mostly due to lack of trust esp towards locals from the past 2 years, possibly pandemic caused/influenced but choices they made that they did not have to make and no these choices have nothing to do with depression, paranoia or isolation caused by the pandemic that many have likely suffered as these choices are clearly sound of mind choices."
0,Having too few friends: sad.   Having this video appear on your recommended videos: way way sadder.
1,"i personnaly think that people always wanna be friend with me because i give attention to others or help them (for example helping the with homework) without the need for them to worry about me and my feelings and think i'm not noticing all that. Or that people only talk to me because they have some sort of pity for me (which is really annoying) when they see me alone and thus create weird, cringy situations where a random guy suddently wanna talk with you about the weather in hope that this only conversation will make me feel better (which is actually doing the opposite) and think i'm dumb enough not to see the weird pity they have for me and the lack of research to find something that would make me happy (i don't know why i should be giving away my time to random strangers to help them when they are down, and they shouldn't do the same).For example, a random classmate fled from his family home because his parents were abusive and i got into contact with him and stayied on the phone with him from midnight to 4am to make him feel better and happy, to be sure that he don't hurt / mutilate himself out of anger and rage and finaly to make him go back to his house in one piece with clear advices to try and make the situation to be better the best i can + . (even tho all went well, we are still not friend irl, but i'm still proud of having done this, i feel more prepared and trained for when such an thing will happen to someone in my reach + i can watch myself in the mirror because i haven't left someone alone the time he needed a ""friend"" the most) for me, such a thing is the only way to prove to someone that you could both be friend not only by self interest or because you have pity : it shows how caring you are about this person's life and how much you know about him but also the fact that you are willing to know more even tho he nerver talked to you. And i feel like nobody would do this to me even once in my life...). in short, i think that, in my 18 years of existence, people only wanted to be friend with me for their own and only interests/benefit and think that i'm so dumb that i wont notice all that. Now, i'm only hoping that at some point my strange/very lonely personnality will make some guys become somehow legit only curious about how i ended up like that, so this would start a conversation that is not based on any self interest / pity, cuz at this time, that is the only way to my knowledge and in my case, that would engage a discussion that could lead to maybe forming some type of bonds"
1,@Kurzgesagt you are a treasure. Please never stop making videos
2,I only have 2 friends ever since.
2,I'd love a video like this about Job ambitions
1,"So Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell has Figured out that majority of their audience is Lonely, anti-social"

2,Why did they have to call me out like this…
1,"It’s so awesome that Kurzgesagt added CATAN to the video, way to go Kurzgesagt!"
1,A topic extremely close to my heart. Thank you Kurzgesagt.
1,"When I am alone is the time when I am not alone, people just make situation worst."
1,"The issue isn't finding friends, the issue is when you go back to being alone after being with them. That abysmal feel actually makes me seeing less and less people : the mediocre morale I have without seeing anyone is better than the HORRIBLE morale that comes with ""friendship comedown"". So yeah, for having been a lone wolf from 12 to 18, then finding excellent friends between 20 and 30, I would actually recommand to stay alone if it's fine for you : Getting friends isn't going to help you being better, the only person that can do this is you."
1,"Was on a group trip last few weeks and made many new friends, one of them feeling like the clostest friend I ever made. Only problem, they all life in the us while I live in europe

0,"What the fuck, stop making fun of me"
1,its not that easy kurtz...
1,"i don’t want friends, is that okay? i’ve seen that it makes you unhealthy if you don’t have friends, but i don’t want any. it’s simply too much of a burden. everyone seems to always expect too much. i made a friend online, and they just started freaking out whenever i wasn’t texting. they texted all the time, it was so exhausting. all my other friends i made have left the country, or for whatever reasons, we can’t talk to each other, (eg. my best friend moved to china (i like in the uk) so time zones are a huge problem. she’s also extremely busy with school, as you can probably imagine.

i have pda, so ND, that makes it hard too. i don’t go out, basically at all, because there’s not really anywhere to meet people here. it’s hard to explain but: i absolutely do not want friends, but i also do.

i think friends are overrated, but i’d like to give it a try.."
1,About 2 mil views in a day proves to me that I’m not alone. To all the losers here a fellow loser looking for friendship here
1,"The only disagreement here is the emphasis on ""in real life.""  Some of my best friends were met through shared interests in particular online games, that have turned into lasting friendships.  Some I've arranged meetups with, others I've never met in person.

Even with friends I made in High School, busy schedules mean that most of our interaction these days is through Discord on the weekends, and we have a grand old time, with conversations still flowing readily on the rare occasions we ARE able to get together for dinner.

I grant that friendships tend to blossom faster in real life, but technology hasn't been entirely detrimental to humanity's social aspirations.  Just as its proven a mindless distraction with long-term negatives, those same pastimes have proven effective networking opportunities to bond while we're shooting aliens together."
1,okay why is youtube giving me this when I'm at the loneliest point in my life so far?????
1,"Loneliness has been my biggest struggle for years because I've been failing to connect with family and meeting new people, being ""new"" to where I am. Anyone who thinks not having friends, or at least one person to talk to, isn't such a huge problem hasn't experienced the slow, tormenting pain of being totally alone and feeling like there is no point in living. This problem of loneliness needs to be given much more attention, but few people care about an issue before it has affected them personally."
2,Wow great timing
1,how big can a creature get? what feats must a theoretical creature overcome to become absolutely massive? does it live in the sea and eat entire kelp forests? does it live in space and eat sunlight and not die in the vacuum of space? is it an enormous pancake creature with 1000s of tiny legs that walks on land and devour jungles? what? i must know the theoretical limits of titans!
1,"""being present in a class a lot without saying a word makes people more sympathetic to you""
what. Uh, no. That has not been my or many other people's experience in classes growing up.
This video was a vibe though, been alone for several years now and I've realized people aren't worth the time investment anymore IMO lol. I can't remember anything on the spot anyway so I'm terrible at small talk due to autism/adhd and a very shitty memory. IMO a lot of people are doomed to lonely existences nowadays and it's only going to get worse with the advent of technology."
1,"I don't feel like friends are necessary anymore, I don't like people an actively avoid them. I don't feel lonely either"
1,This title feels personal.
1,"It feels really weird that a Kurzgesagt's video doesn't let you worse than before, with a sensation of hopelessness, but a good feeling. 

PD: where's the black hole in this video? Haha"
1,I haven’t watched the video at all cause an ad was going and I paused it but I assume based off the top comment and the video title this is very nice so good job hard to pronounce channel name.
1,I have no social skills besides knowing when to shut up
2,"Just saying, when you have friends, don't expect them to always give or share things, respect their choices aswell."

1,"my major Problem withfinding new friends:
As a child/young adult you will find most of your friends in forced random groups. (school, after school Groups like sport or music, Parents friends and Neighbours)
As an adult you will find yourself in less of these groups which will defently result in meeting less new people and finding viewer new friends... Work is (hopefully) a stable position and most of us need a break from co-workers.

TL;DR: if you dont meet new people, you cant find new friends. at young age we get forced to do this, at older age we stop it."
1,Honestly I find the statistics and science behind these videos really helpful and good. I’m not great with judging my social skills but facts don’t lie!

1,"im shy, introverted, socially awkward, struggling with school and it feels like my only friends are slowly drifting away and its almost impossible to find friends like me when everyone is the opposite.. why life gotta be so hard?"
1,You know it’s serious when kurzgesagt is telling you have no friends
1,I drive semi-trucks and let me tell you it can be a very lonely profession.  I have found that buying a virtual reality headset and playing social platforms such as VRChat have been instrumental in me keeping my sanity in check and has allowed for me to connect with people online so that I don't feel as lonely when come home from work.

I will never get used to the feeling of being alone, I have always spent my life with my first love, after he died he was always in my heart. Now I have moved on, he is gone, I have accepted this.

1,"I got called “lame” by a box today, yes you read that right, and then I get this recommended to me…long day"
0,The saddest video of all.
2,I'll be your friend :) blue_heart
1,"It's frustrating to me that it's not socially acceptable to just jump into a deep conversation with somebody. There's so much small talk that you have to go through first but it's sooo boring. I want to know how you view the world, what can we learn from one another."
2,"Thanks. This is...   








Amazing, true and very very helpful to those who need help or are lonley"
1,"Oh, man! Finally i can fix my life!"
1,"I live this video. Also, the OTS, what an amazing tune"
1,Such a nice video. I wanted to reach out to someone but hesitated. This gave me courage to do it. Thinking about just a pain for few minutes or a life long friendship is a game changer
1,"Kurz, is the spicy food / introvert thing scientific ?"
1,Who needs friends. One moment you’re so happy the next they run a knife through you.
1,"So the short answer is: ""Be A Cat"". Considering cats: chose us (5+k years ago); moved in, remained chill, and now a serious percentage of us love them, seems to support your theory. :)"
1,"What I find difficult with this video is that almost every single one of Kurzgesagt's other videos, a sinister agenda or provable lie is being promoted, proof that this channel is compromised. But in this one, all I could find with even a notion of sinister in it was a birthday invitation and a dinosaur."
1,Not first
1,I dont need this vid but i sometimes i feel lonely lol
1,"And please make a video about how to make a girl/boyfriend, or about what love is."
2,this is nice.. but I hope you back science ideas.
1,Let this video be your reminder to reach out to a friend you haven't talked to in a while. You might reach them when they most need it.
1,Its hard to find people that are like you and are willing to participate in events with you.
1,"Step 1: stop listening to corporate
Step 2: rethink what friends means and what are you actually trying to do. This can take years."
1,"""... although you're perfectly average."""
1,I don't know anyone who doesn't need this video. Thank you.
1,These are the topics that really matrer
1,"I was constantly dismissed/talked over so much in my childhood and teen years, I was tinier than my peers, extremely soft spoken and quite fearful of people in general, that I gave up trying to make friends at all, because it felt that escaping conversations were an easy way out than sitting through and being judged/mocked/laughed at. That led me to not belong in any clique and it felt so lonely, yikesss. Thankfully I realised that I have to initiate effort to maintain friendships and I made some nice ones. If you stay quiet all the time, people think you're not interested in them, and eventually they lose interest too. Effort is must, despite some negative feedbacks. You have to face the fear and overcome the anxiety, the latter generally comes from imagining scenarios that will never happen."
1,I was worried to find mostly self depreciating comments but most of them seem very inspiring
2,"It's not about making friends, that is pretty easy. It is difficult to make GOOD friends. I'd rather be lonely than being stuck with crappy friends"
1,I'm having a fever now
2,THIS IS PERFECT TIMING
1,For some reason this episode feels kinda low budget compared to lately
2,buy friend in Walmart.
2,I was literally depressed and had no friends and then fond this. smiling_faceface_holding_back_tears
1,What I love most about this video is that there is a recurring cast of characters whose relationships evolve throughout the video
1,"As a bass guitarist. I appreciate the ""lemon"" amplifier grinning_face_with_sweat

Another great video!"
1,"My friend has not geen giving me enough attention recently, and she doesn't realize. I do all the talking, while usually both of us would laugh together. She doesn't answer my messages these days, and if I try talking to her about it, she gets so angry. I'm sending her this video, not that she'll watch it anyway, but ah well. It's worth a try."
1,"Okay what’s up with the insane hair colors and skin colors, I mean it’s acceptable on birds byt please don’t do it on people"
2,God damnit I love this channel
2,"I love the animation, where can I do the same animation for my video? Pls help me, thanks"
1,I got called on discord by my friend but then i saw this video and declined the call to watch this
1,"what do you do when youre 20 tho? how would u find someone to share a schedule with consistently? and how on earth would you make that happen in a way that isnt awkward? its 2022, no one above the age of 10 seems to talk or make friends anymore, people dont even talk to their professors. barely have enough energy for classes, so any friendship that starts takes too much additional energy and just fizzles out.

this video only helps if ur not old, depressed, have a bad self-image/confidence problem, or are in college. this is such an oversight, i demand a new updated tutorial."
1,Whats grass
1,only kurzgesagt would give you a detailed explanation on why you got no friends
2,sigh
1,Oh the timing of this video face_holding_back_tearseyesraising_hands_medium_skin_tone
0,Is it bad that I got used to this feeling?
1,"Idk i have just accepted that i have no friends. I don't really like the majority of people and i just can't relate to the majority of people. I hate small talk, i really to talk that much at all so, If one day i find the person who is somehow similar to me or connect to then yay. But in the meantime i'm doing my own stuff."
2,they know their audience well
1,Spend time maintaining relationships so you can live longer?
1,"... honestly, this has been a hit or miss for me...

I'm in the Seattle area - and things were starting good at first. We had a week of going out and meeting new people...

But this week.... both me and my partner has been trying to set up more events to hang out - and everyone has been seemingly ignoring us....

In Seattle.... there's this thing called ""the social freeze"" - where it's difficult to make friends out here. People say they want to break this habit - but never put the effort to actually break it...

.... Leaving people like me and my partner to feel completely alienated....."
1, If only I had heard of this advice ages ago and followed through with it.
1,"This is all true for ""normal"" people. For sociophobics, unfortunately it's considerably more difficult..."
1,I hope the people who used to be our bestfriends are fine and happy even If we don't know anything about them rn
1,What about toxic relationships? I'm afraid to make new friends because I've had a few toxic friends
1,Finally a video not about that we are going to die tomorrow
2,This is so cute loudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_face
1,"I had a big falling out with most of my “friends” from high school after realizing most of the relationships were just manipulating me; so I cut off ties with essentially everyone aside from distant acquaintances who I barely spoke to anyway.

Now I’ve been in college for a while; and I have yet to make friends, let alone SPEAK to anyone or be spoken to. I’m too shy to make the first move; but no one makes it for me, and I’m split in this stupid mindset that I can’t correct. 

Losing my “friends” that way I guess messed me up to some degree, to the point that I feel that I can’t *really* trust anyone; there’s always hidden intentions and no one GENUINELY wants to be my friend just because they like me. 

Which maybe isn’t true; but I haven’t seen evidence of the contrary. It also doesn’t help that I have no social media; meaning I’m completely isolated, and honestly, I’m not sure how to approach this stuff.

I don’t feel… negative? In any sense, about my solitude. It’s just weird, I guess. 

Sorry, that was a complete rant. No one’s gonna read this anyway, most people have valid loneliness concerns here and THOSE are the ones that should get attention."
1,"What if you live in a small town without ""clubs"" and such?"
1,Where are the animated ducks
2,"Thank you, now I must go to make friends."
1,Nisargadatta Maharaj: You are lonely as a person.  In your real being you are the whole.
0,"Yo wtf, this is literally me. Slowly losing friends from high school and uni."
2,Basically what you need to do is spend time with your friends and be wise in choosing them
1,The advice in this video seems a mixed bag. I disagree about making friends from school and work - because this can usually lead to a conflict of interest or overbearing individuals that don't read the room enough. I agree with making friends from trusted communities or social groups - you are more likely to form relationships based on genuine connection and interests - not just make fabricated relationships based on random chance. I'm not saying that you won't make genuine connections from work and school: but they seem harder to obtain/maintain as you don't want to appear unprofessional at work AND school friendships usually only last if you live in the same community. Virtual friendships seem easier to grasp than physical ones.
2,Anyone wana be my friend?
1,"""So the most important principle of making friends is to regularly spend time with people in the real world.""
And yet, everyone I speak to seems to believe that working from home, alone in front of your computer, is the single greatest thing ever. And I feel like an alien saying I miss being with people physically."
1,I think I'm just invisible
1,the problem is i gotta go to work
1,Quality over quantity flexed_biceps
1,"Worst part is when you are still dealing with the trauma of being mistreated by your former group of ""friends""
It changes everything. You don't feel the drive to make friends out of fear, you don't feel the drive to connect with them out of fear the drop will hurt that much more."
2,"Really perfect time for a video like this. I relate so much <3. 
you dropped this crown"
1,I've seen tiktok advice that just tells you to be completely fake or gives the worst advice. This is a good video
2,"Nice timing, youtube"
1,"At  hit me. Seems like I've actually have had way fewer friends in my 30s, than I did when I was younger."
1,"WOW too many comments  ""I"" ""ME"" , -> STOP IT! YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG!  IF you want Friends stop Being self-interested! As video said, start with what person/people you would be interested in , like ""i like to  watch cartoons, do you like to watch cartoons too?"",I listen to Gifted Gambler? do you ... I'm interested in weapons of Mass destruction, are you .... (few minutes later ... FBI: sends you a friend request. O_O )"
2,"Your videos are keep getting better and better, thank you so much for the hard work!!!man_bowingman_bowingman_bowingman_bowingman_bowingman_bowing"
2, I would say that playing Settlers of Catan it's actually the easiest way to lose friends grinning_face_with_sweat
1,LOL I was having this conversation with a coworker yesterday and I've been struggling with this for a while. I chose to attend boardgame events near my house to get to know people and I opened myself to make friends with close like minded people regardless their status and age.
1, This is too real face_with_tears_of_joy
1,"As someone who has gone through a lot of schools, it's surprisingly easy how much people are willing to connect with you, despite already having established friend groups. Sure, more often than not, I was comfortable in getting lunch by myself while reading on my phone; but being able to have fun, tell silly jokes with others, and complain about schoolwork was nice. I don't have many close friends, but the ones I do have are precious to me."
1,"It's crazy how much COVID uprooted many common things we took for granted, like friendship."
1,"You see the less friends you have.
The less drama you will face."
1,"Man, Kurzgesagt really calling me out here huh"
1,I don't know.... and also don't know where to start from... I'm suffering through a lot but now I'm just quiting and sitting and leaving rest to fate.....but thought when my fate will hit hard ...that time to say a goodbye people_hugging ....
1,Imagine how many people are going to go into work or school tomorrow and make a really good friend

1,"TW: Suicide and PTSD
(I just needed to vent, sorry)






I’m pretty young, and during the pandemic I lost the closest friend I’ve ever had. I have ptsd now. Every time someone I know becomes slightly absent in my life,  I get daily panic attacks for basically the whole week. I’m also neurodivergent, so not many people share the same interests I have. Whenever I hyperfixate on something I tend to tell my friends about it. It used to be more intense, but none of my friends understand that I have any shame. Which is insane, because oversharing was the main reason I have ptsd now. 
I have been struggling socially intensely. At this point I have two friends that I click with.

I don’t know who needs to hear this, but you can ruin someone’s life with one decision. I’m sure I’ll bounce back at some point, but that’s assuming I’ll make it to 30."
1,"This video is birds teaching to humans to be more humans.
Awesome"
1,completely called out
0,Tiktok is so trash its now littertly ruining friendships
1,"my best friend literally dropped my yesterday.. :/ and it’s because of another girl who became our “friend” last year when i was in 6th now i’m in 7th and i realised that she literally manipulated us and my i guess ex best friend.. we were best friends for 5 years and that’s like in 2nd grade. And yk what she said? she said “ (my name) i can’t be friend with u anymore, u get scolded so much and u never get better when u say u will” but i never even said “i will get better” cuz WHAT DID I EVEN DO?! she’s literally doing that cuz our “ friend” told her to, and yk she  also deleted the message a few minutes after, a week ago she ignored me too cuz “our friend” told her to.. i can never trust that girl ever again like i used to.."
1,You guys have such good animation. You should definitely make an anime some day

2,"Friends ruin everything, I won't make any again, despite me being lonely. When I had ""friends"" I'm still lonely."
2,"I was trying to search about how to make friends, thank u"
1,I truly don't mind it really.
1,"Please make a video about Artificial Intelligence and the future with it. AGI and ASI stuff which I recently learnt and changed my view about future, a little scary, I learnt about it from wait but why post, which was written in 2015. Can you please make a video about it with latest updates and likely prediction?"
1,"i have a quite unique situation when it comes to making friends. 

also i tried to meet exactly 237 people before i gave up on trying to make friends in my area. my family moved to europe, away from my quaint little town is southern michigan. something i learned in europe: the area im in, everyone my age is a jackass, for lack of nicer words. ive always been a really nice person, but being here for nine months, almost 10 without friends has taken a toll on my mental health. try and reach out to me and find some way to help; i'd really appreciate it."
1,"I have no social life because of my father's job... 
His job requires him to change cities a LOT, and so we're always moving from place to place... 
I'm 16 rn and I've already changed 12 cities and 14 schools... we never remain at the same place for more than a few months to 2 years maximum, neither do I have close relationships with my extended or close family..."
1,"I've got a problem with something said on   - ""One of the perplexities is that to get something it can be helpful to convince yourself that you want it less than you actually do""
It can be that way indeed, and it can also be the opposite, and somewhere in the middle ground.
Trying to convince yourself of what you're not is bad advice, I think. It's hard to be laid back when it's you yourself that is pushing yourself back / or forward /inwards/outwards.

I think it's rather charming when people are hyper. I easily make friends with people with ADHD since they often take initiative to this and that and I'm rather passive and just sit and watch clouds. It gets me off my butt with energetic people.
But I don't like when me or others try to be someone they're not. And I think that convincing yourself that you don't want to hang out so badly is the message I got from .

I would've expressed it ""If you think that you are too forward then use some of that energy to ponder what others might like about you. Relationships are not just for what you can get out of them, it's what you both can get out of hanging out"" or something.

I think it sparked something in me since one of my latest greatest findings are that people seem to like me more, and I enjoy myself more when I let myself be on the level of energy/intensity that comes naturally. Neither pushing down or up my energy to get liked by others, but rather waking comfort in others by being comfortable in myself."
1,I think this might become the new most viewed vid on this channel
1,"I choose to be lonely. Tried to make friends found they were using me or being two faced. ""friends"" just drag me down. ill keep to myself so i dont have to deal with problems. Takes awhile but you'll get ahold of being on your own."

1,"I left my home country and moved alone across the world where I still strugle with the local language, it is specially hard and depressing to find new people to bond with. This video gives me a lot of hope for a better future."

I wouldn't mind a few human friends but I'd rather be lonely than gaslit, manipulated, and used and that's just how it is.

2,Good books vs fair weather “friends”? Books win every single time .
1,"Meh in all honesty I feel friends with people are just miserable to be with. It’s easier to be friends and talk to with plants, animals, or rocks. Human friends are not only exhausting but almost all the time disappointing. 

Personally I’m tired of friendship, this isn’t a statement that I’m better than you I’m not. Nor is it a statement that you shouldn’t have friends. I would rather be alone than to deal with the worst problem in my life, which is people. 

I’m not a good person, I genuinely mean that. And I don’t personally care about it. What I’m trying to say is that after attempting so many friendships I think I’m done. It’s been too painful and I would rather just live my life alone."

0,All of that sounds so exhausting
1,"An utterly impractical video that can be reiterated as ""just simply go and find friends"". Not a mention how ubearable such move can be and how complex pattern to do it requires. How tormented people can be literally feeling imprisoned behind impenetrable invisible wall separating them from the society. It's as difficult as to quit taking drugs."

1,"For anyone interested in more, I recommend the Ted Talk and the book called The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane. She started off as an extremely shy introvert, and did a lot of research and became a very outgoing introvert. (How you get energy doesn't change, only your social skills.) What she learned about how to be outgoing/charismatic is very interesting and basically the upper division course version of this video. Good luck!

And just an interesting aside, as one of the central hub extroverts mentioned, this was a great video to watch still. I'm moving soon. I hadn't thought through what will happen to all my introvert friends when I'm not here throwing all the board game and movie night and birthday parties. One of the introverts sets up beach days, so maybe I'll just push them into doing a few of the other events before I'm gone so people have time to get used to the invitations coming from someone else. Great to be thinking about!"

But I've just decided to maintain the friendships I've already got, and just learn to be happy being alone. I get my socialization at work and otherwise prioritize being alone, in the quiet. I think the trick is to be aware that I'm not doing what I'm designed to do, but I can adapt to it as long as I'm mindful. It's working alright so far."

After nearly 2 years it may already be too late but I don't want any more friendships to fade because of time or distance.

Please check on your kids. Let them know you are safe to talk to and get them professional help if needed. I’ve seen way too many parents who didn’t realize their kids were suffering as much as they were until it was too late, if you know what I mean."
0,I am friendless. I'm 20. Life is hard without friends. Contact me now if you like me. Be everywhere.
1,"All this does is make me miss school and sad my best years are behind me. As you said, school makes friends and meeting people easier. With school done, life is hollow and empty, no truly meaningful happiness ever again."
2,I have more friends now than ever before but now I'm just exhausted and stressed by it.  I was much happier alone.
2,"thank you this was an inspirational video i will now go get some bitches, thanks Kurzgesagt"
1,Side note: feeling lonely doesn’t mean you don’t have friends. We ALL feel lonely at the end of the day.
2,as always great vid !
2,"No no, I have enough friends. I've got one good friend."
1,"I never understood why everyone is so gung ho on making friends. They are as much of a nuisance as they are uplifting. I had tight-knit friendships all the way up to around 25, then I dumped them like a bad habit. If you are lonely, get a dog! :-D"
2,yeah i have no hope for making close friends rn skull
1,Hi I have question for the the Video that you posted from 3 years ago about strange matter can strange matter destroy dark matter
1,"I've always liked having limited human/face to face interaction, even with my friends. I just don't enjoy being in front of a person, so online friends are plentiful and real life ones are few. That's the way I like it, and the way I'm happiest."
1,"Fear of abandonment has made me friendless since i was 18, im 40. After being unceremoniously dumped by my pier group in high school and watching a few  almost friendship wither and die in early 20s, then for years ruminating on the pain  of realising that no one visited me or texted. The pain of being ditched is now a greater motivating factor then even the misery i feel being friendless."
1,"Im in middle school but I've been homeschooled since I was in second grade so I have no friends, I've always been lonely but I don't really feel lonely, idk if it's just because I'm used to it or not but I really want people to talk to, I have a lot of trouble keeping friends, I'm definitely an introvert and definitely a shy person but it's sad that I have no close friends. I'm just alone with my dogs."
1,"Well, odd that this was posted just as school was starting for me... Not sure if I have the guts to put myself out there after secluding myself for a long time but we'll see."
1,"i tried unaliving myself 2s ago, now im free and i m so hapi you dont realuzt howa hppy i amnbn i lobe you kurezaagesazagt"
1,"One caveat, there are some people who don't feel the lack of friends - though the idea that they should have friends, because it's an expectation in society, can cause anxiety - ""I don't have friends and I'm expected to, what's wrong with me?"".  It's important for these people to understand that it's ok to not seek out friendship, there is nothing wrong with them, if they don't feel lonely or have an interest in having friends. It's still important to be kind and aware and open with others - but you don't have an obligation to build friendships if it's just not something you want to do."
2,What about too many friends? thinking_face
1,"To be honest, this video would not help people with a wounded ego (narcissistic trauma) because they just don't trust anyone who is kind to them. Because of their mood swings, it's difficult for them to explain their feelings to others and they tend to have high or low self esteem depending on their own rejection experience. 

They always overthink stuff and have thoughts that others hate them or don't give them enough attention. It's just makes everything even more difficult."
1,Will I still be alpha (sigma) If I try to have more friends?
1,"I'm in my freshmen year of collage. I've struggled with a lot of depressive thoughts and emotions my whole life. But I'm at the point that I'm tired of the stress. A lump of coal isn't going to form itself. You have to put it through a lot of heat, pressure, and importantly, time and effort. If you do that, You can become a diamond.

Be the diamond that shines to your peers in life. Shine to your family. But most importantly, shine to yourself. You must change the person you are right now to become the person you want to be.

I wish all of you the best with seeking for peers in your life. beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes"

0, Yeah no. That rejection hurts forever and stacks with others. After some time you stop trying out of self preservation.
1,no way did a kurzgesagt video just make me cry
1,My introvert self: I want to watch this to make new friends... *but do I need one?*
1,"im 19, and i work with people much older than me, i work directly with a 40 year old man and a 60 year old woman, so it is difficult to make connections with people when i have nothing to talk about with anyone. it's frustrating and lonely"
1,I love the many references to Catan! Catan has not yet failed me to bring people together and develop new friends in college. Keep up the Catan references!!!
1,Everybody saying what the Kurzgesact doing? But never: How the Kurzgesact doing. I’ll be the first: how are you doing?
1,This almost turned me into an extrovert
2,ohh i love how the animations and graphics look 
2,"As a modest introvert, I have found making friends easy and losing friends even easier. Putting in a small effort is the builder and moving away is the killer.

I thought I could share something that might help certain introverts. I remember the times I met disinterest after making an attempt at friendship. In retrospect, I feel proud of making attempts instead of bad for failing. Good luck out there."
0,The title of the vid is like a personal attack.
1,"Hi kurzgesagt, do you think you will ever post any YouTube Shorts.And what about a vid about how pets can affect someone’s personal life"
2,Lol because I can’t start a conversation

1,"Kurzgesagt, why do you have to mock me rn. This is somewhat an insecurity for me, but I'm trying to cope by other hobbies like books and workout. It isn't super effective but it is something. Also for the first time I'm going to talk to an actual therapist this week. Hope all goes in positive direction for me, you and all"

0,Ow that hurt
2,Bro why is this in my recommended loudly_crying_faceskull_and_crossbones
1,"I can never have permanent friends because i always overshare and i will never change because i cant. Either that, or they just get tired of me in general. These are online friends only btw, as i cannot go outside and make friends because the people out there judge me by my looks and not my personality."
1,"That caring trick, i have tried that many times, so much so that now all acquaintances of mine consider me as an Ace card, last resort, problem solver, trouble shooter or whatever you want call it. I wanted them to be my friend and i am left with these acquaintances who always need my help. The tragedy is that i am now attached to those people (can't say same for them) and can't able to muster the strength to say NO, at least once. Looks like i am stuck with this, scraping for momentarily affection when i fulfill their wishes and then abandoned in limbo afterwards until they come again with another wish. [DiowE]"

2,Thank you for making me feel lonely
2,I really hope this video helps some people get out there and meet some great friends
1,"Way I'm making new friends is by starting going to a new local DnD store that has weekly game nights. It isn't the same as a private game around someone's dinner table, but it's doing good so far.

Edit: Also, parts of this video feel very much like callouts of why I have so few real friends nowadays..."
1,"I have never been able to make new friends apart from university. 90% of people outside of that stage of their lives are just not interested, unless you are providing something but then you only become a transactional friend."

1,"You guys are absolutely incredible! Now not only with your show, books, stuff, but also with activities! Thank you!"
1,"I wasn't very mentally healthy as a teenager, the things I would say and do would be getting attention from people. They'd laugh because I'm trying to show my good side, but then they see what I didn't---how my behavior was very abnormal for my age and due to the way I was raised I freaked people out. I didn't do my part on maintaining relationships with people since I was so used to being ditched by people my age and the adult figures in my life. I had no role models, no one to look up to. I was a walking shell who just couldn't make friends. The only friends I could make were those who wanted to date. I'd date them and would sometimes be in their friend circle, sometimes they were okay with me. Sometimes they didn't really want me involved and I had to be okay with that.  I had to just accept that I was a messed up person and it just wasn't time for me to have friends no matter how hard I tried. Recently I had been doing therapy and meds for the past year, I've always seen the red flags that I had and how to better manage them. My character has changed, I feel like an actual person with feelings and have been getting to know what my priorities are in life. I do wish that sometimes I would've tried harder to make friends but when I look back on it, they weren't even good people. I think it was good that I finally got to this point in my life because when the time does come, maybe I can actually make friends, maybe I'll find some people who will like me. I'm glad I've worked on myself, old me would be really happy to see that. 

So if you're having trouble making friends, maybe it's just not the right time in your life to have friends. Maybe there's times where you need to work on yourself. You have to be a good friend to yourself before you can be a friend to another person. Evaluate your priorities for yourself, and what you want in a friendship. We will all get there someday."
2,"thank you for the reminder, I'll call my friend to meet up. Been missing them a lot."
2,Thanks for this smiling_face
1,"God forbid you actually reach out to be a friend for someone. I don't have any friends or family and I haven't had human contact in years. I'm old. Nobody wants to hang out with an old person. Our minds aren't old. Just our bodies are. I wish, when I was younger, I'd spent more time with the elderly. I know how lonely it is now. crying_face I talk to myself, and I think... maybe it's better this way. A friend is someone who will talk to you and you enjoy each other's company. A friend is someone who will go for a walk with you. A friend is someone you can share with. A friend is someone you can invite to dinner. A friend is someone who calls...oh yeah, people don't use the phone anymore. A friend is personal and in person, not fake and halfway across the world. A friend is someone you can trust with your life. A friend is someone you can touch, a hug, a handshake or fist bump. A friend is someone who has the same or similar mindset as you. A friend is someone you enjoy being around. Fake friends are a dime a dozen. You can find millions of them on social media outlets. Don't ever try a dating app they're all scams. Usually men pretending to be women..... nevermind. It all seems so useless."

I didn’t realize so many people struggled with making friends, but my advice would be to just talk to people around you. I get that seems obvious but that’s genuinely the only way"
1,Is this video enough to redeem you for the amount of existential dread you have filled me with? Eh
2,this is a really nice video. lots of good advice here.
1,I just started my 11th year of school after I just moved schools and this comes up in the morning! Thank you Kurzgesagt for all the work you guys have put into your videos!

~Don't mean to be cynical here, great vid nonetheless"
1,"Question . Do virtual friends work ? Cause my best friend is from another country we've never seen in real life . But we talk everyday for hours. We feel like we understand each other but sometimes it hits that we can't see or experience real life experiences. So, is it real ? Or are we making a mistake concentrating our friendship in us being so far away instead of people closer to us in real life."
1,"A marvellous video! The only problem not covered is how to find good friends of the gender that likes your gender and NOT start a romantic relationship, especially one-sided on their part. Also, my piece of advice: nothing makes friendships as strong as week-long hiking tours, regular volunteering and political activism together."
1,Kurzgesagt you guys always show me at the exact moment when help is needed :\
1,"When I was a kid, I always found it kind of sad that it seemed like my grandparents, who were really awesome and dynamic fun people, didn't have many friends.  Now as I get older (approaching 50), I see that this happens to more and more people as life goes on, myself included.  When I was in my 20s, I was constantly surrounded by so many different social groups (friends from college, work friends, theatre friends, friends of whatever girl I was dating, rando bar groups) that it was overwhelming at times.  But once you have kids and move out to the burbs, your social circle gets smaller as distance sets in--a quick beer at the pub on the corner becomes a planned night out with an uber--and of course, all those friends are moving and having families too.  I joked in my 40s that I only see my friends at weddings.  Now approaching 50, I mostly see them at funerals or the occasional boys' night out.  The interesting thing is that this feels okay to me, natural even.  I have of course made new friends out here in the burbs, but they aren't as important to my identity as my friends in my 20s or in college were.  I wonder if my grandparents felt the same way."
1,"Let me tell you what I think, things are lonelier than ever and it will only get more worst.
Why?
Because of the things you do that make you happy.
Seems counter intuitive?
The present situation, as we see with capitalism, is going for the very best one possibly can hence expecting increase in competition and hence putting in more time in work.
That includes no longer dealing with any kind of shit your current group has to offer be it family or friends.
You just want to be like that kind of 'person' in your feed. The reason he/she is there because he sacrificed his time and relationships to become one. But you don't see how lonely that person is. You only see the good side.
Because apparently, doing stuff that you like gives your life some sense of meaning. 

Our grandparents, sticked with each other at the time of difficulties, not looking for something better, not going for their career goals. Friends had time for each other. To waste time together, to do stuff 'together'."

1,"saving this video so everytime i feel lonely ill watch it and know that its okay to go out. its okay to talk to people.

1,"I've never felt lonely. Why is it so hard for people to be by themselves? Bunch of cowards

1,I feel personally called out
1,This is really wel timed for me i moved to a wew class and i have no friend there everyone know eachother there. Thank you for this videosmiling_face_with_hearts
1,Just the video I needed.. sigh
2,"Wait because a close group of people who like connections more than I do makes me ill, wow health never sounded so bad!"
1,"A super-critical element in reinforcing friendships is facing catastrophes together. This is why casual time is so important. The more time simply spent around eachother, the more opportunities there are for something bad to happen, which is when the gloves come off and people show their strength and skill. This is when subconscious attachments form. The conscious self loves quirks and glamor, but the subconscious self loves survival skills."
1,"I just feel that having no friends isn't something really serious, all relations we can have are mostly acquaintances, or penpals , or colleagues, or bosses/workers."

0,"I,m lonely. What about you?"
1,"terrible content, as though, written by an 60-90 year old person.  the scare is similar back in the day were kids don't go to libraries or read books, watching tv all day long.  socializing is now different with technology where location is not a hindrance, and connect with people all over the globe.  also with cheaper travel and technology, younger kids now socialize more with other kids from other countries.  the introvert/extrovert thing is also decades old thinking that the average person can be introvert/extrovert or very few are extremely one or the other. 
the problem though is work/jobs especially in South East Asian countries where there is little time/energy for family, friends, let alone make own family, thus alarming dropping birthrates despite ever increasing GDP or productivity."
1,"The only major issue I have with this video is that it fails to account for people who are lonely because of trauma, neurological differences or plain old discrimination. I for one have issues with contacting other people, as taking the initiative generally results in disgust from others for some reason. And at my age, having no social experience is a red flag onto itself, further limiting how much can I even grind for socialization without annoying innocent bystanders."
2,Who wants to be friends ?
1,"It sometimes fells like some people are destined to have no friends, I have gotten many friends before but almost every time they have ditched me, and the only reason why was because it was who I was and how I acted."
1,This is personal

1,"If it tells you how much I needed this video, I have a snap score of about 60 and I've had snapchat for like 4 years"
1,"What about when going out isn’t fun in any way? Nothing I do for fun involves others or even leaving the house since I’ve been alone all my life. I try picking up activities around others like sports or clubs, but don’t enjoy them so of course I never make friends there.  I’m convinced I’ll just die alone soon I guess."
1,Why are there so many views on this
1,"Here a person who was very popular with a lot of friends and a group of 'bruhs' but then two central friends stop talking to me. They were so jeallousy of mine and really I swear made up a stupid thing to stop talk to me. They drag the rest of the group because they won't hang only with me they prefer the whole group. Adult life and bang no friends. I have so much more social skills than average because of those years. So yes is not just that, you need luck to. I met people in university and work that simply don't want more friends to hang out with. Ok is cool to socialize at work/univ but outside they gf, family and their friends group. One of the few friends that I still hang out with has other luck: he always works or study with people that want to hang out...
Sure you can't be retarded narcisist or wtv but you need luck with the people you cross with in life. And man am I bad at luck xd man I love you all bros so much health for you. I am trying to mantain and build friendships but with little hope at this"
1,"Wow. So i have someone spying on me. I recently moved to my home country after a whole life of living elsewhere where I had family i actually knew and lasted friends. At first, online classes made it easier but when school opened, i realised my lack of social skill. I found and am finding it hard to make friends, and i feel like i embarass myself way too often. And i may be shifting schools again next year, so it's even harder trying to find connections. I'm gonna try my level best."
1,Way to go Kurgesagt Hit me right in the feels why don't ya.
1,"If you are shy and indoor person, try out VR. It’s one of the best ways to create new friends for introverts!"
1,Why do you know my problemsface_with_raised_eyebrow
1,"I have been struggling with severe depression and social anxiety so bad these last 2 years, because i had to move out for university... and i still have no friends... i feel so dumb for not remembering most of my colleagues names... it also doesnt help that most of them live in towns out of the city, and so it can be very difficult to meet up with them, as they would constantly need to book train tickets, or buses, or drive for km just to hang out, which is generally doable but not very often...

and sadly, consistency is what i lack.

i am extremely shy, and i always think i am a burden to others.
i have a flatmate and we are not friends. i am too scared. she is moving out soon anyways, so i hope my next roommates will be people i can share more nice moments with, although i doubt it. my landlord does not discriminate between students and workers, and big age gaps between those who are interested in renting a room. 

i dont talk to anybody, and its still extremely difficult for me to open up. my childhood has had me being treated by some of my classmates like i am some weirdo, some lonely nerdy kid that was too loud and too much of a loser for liking to draw and play videogames.

i do have friends luckily, but most of them live in my home country. so we only really hang out when i come over in the summer. which is awesome, but because of my low social battery capacity, even then i get very tired and desperately need a break.

this summer specifically after having such fun times with them i decided that i was sick of this life of me doing... nothing... being unable to concentrate on studying (i am in fact failing), having no one to go to a little bar with, or walk in the park with, maybe drink a beer, eat a pizza, you get it. i have some relatives here and when they invite me for lunch or to go somewhere nice i usually accept because i do not want to stay home and feed the depression vicious cycle. anything is better than lazily laying in bed and going hungry because you cant bother to go to the grocery store next to the building you live in. at least my relatives love me.

i will try to go to my uni physically more, and i guess try to learn to genuinely compliment people, to get into a conversation, exchange phone numbers, that stuff. i will also try to go out with this very nice and friendly girl that approached me and introduced me to a few people. i dont want to lose my chances.

remember, people. everybody is a potential friend. we all need connections. you are not unloveable. sure you might be a bit of a loser but... is that the end of the world? does that make you a bad person? do you not want to receive, and give love?"

1,"i had never friend i was depressive and went to a doctor... but i noticed that there is no real friendship. its always a give and take. if you dont provide what the other one needs, he will stop contact. I learned to live with no friends. I will die alone so whats the problem with living alone"
1,The fact that over 1 million people watched this video in 10 hours shows how many lonely people there are out there wanting to make friends
1,"Sometimes when you finally have the courage to message to your old friends but got very brief and short reply for a polite rejection after a long time, it feels even miserable :/ 
Sometimes it's not two of you lose the relationship but yourself because the other person didn't aware of the existence of the line."
1,"Need advice, asking for a friend - what do you do if one of your best friends no longer calls to hang out with you, says theyre busy everytime you suggest things (nothing bad happened, no traumatic events), and you stop calling because you dont want to be a nuisance but you still miss hanging out with them?"
1,"The hints on making friend are goid but the biggest problem is getting together

1,"I’m a community college instructor. I’m seeing this in my current class of students. This semester is my first time with students who spent their key teen years online schooling due to the pandemic. I really feel for them. They suffer from severe social anxiety, their math and logic skills are garbage, and they’re woefully underprepared for adult life compared to students from years past. I find myself trying to be a part time therapist in an effort to break through their mental blocks. These young adults need more in-person classroom experiences to develop their own hopes and dreams."
0,The worst thing is that you're hit so hard by fake friends.......those who aren't true.
2,I'm gonna share this with my friend when I meet him this Saturday.

1,Boutta become the most viewed video from the channel skull
1,It’s funny how the internet connects us more than ever yet we feel more lonely than ever.
1,I personally find it very hard to find a good friend because I'm quite demanding and not easily satisfied. I have interestets that are not very common and the things most people are into just don't interest me at all. And besides that I became so socially anxious over the years that I'm not even able to make contact anymore.
0,is this a personal attack?!?!
1,Im 15 years old I've been a loner for quite some time well since I started high school been trying to make make friends but I just get anxious and run ut things to say and the awkward silence really makes me feel like I'm a wierdo well I'm trying to improve that so that I don't become a depressed and lonely person later on .

1,I cried through this entire video... Guess I should probably make some friends
1,All my friends said my views on covid meant we couldnt be friemds
1,"Anti social personality disorder, Aspergers and high functioning autism... nearly 30 now and at this point I'm just happy I managed to get a good career. 

Sometimes it's easier to be happy with what you have, sometimes it's not as simple as listening to advice from people who haven't experienced anything similar to you grinning_face_with_sweat sometimes accepting your life is the best thing to do.

 It's OK to be alone, but not lonely"
0,"Being alone is painful, but having people that don't listen is pain."
1,FOR THE EMPOROR!!!
1,"This could not be more relevant to my life right now. I lost my entire social social and support network during the beginning of covid, and then moved across the country, unable to make friends because lockdowns and restrictions made meeting people nearly impossible. Under that stone, I found many online friends during that time, and have grown very close with them, regularly talking and sharing our lives. However, as much as I love them, I always find myself feeling half-empty, because while they are great friends and they care about me, I will never be able to get together with them in real life, and though the mental and emotional gap is partially filled in my heart through them, I still crave the physical aspect of friendships. It would be very interesting to see how many other people feel the same way.

Luckily, my university is finally back in-person as of the fall 2022 semester, and although I commute an hour each way and am not as involved in the college community because of my commute, I have slowly been starting to talk to people at my university, and it's validating to know that despite the lack of friends and lack of socializing over the past two years, I still have it in me to make connections. 

I suppose maybe I should pick up the phone, get over my phone call anxiety, and call some old high school friends that I haven't spoken to since pre-covid 2020. Maybe they're feeling the same way."
1,This was a really sweet video that's very much in need.
1,"I recently lost my best friendship because that person now runs a firm, became a workaholic and just dropped her commitment to me. With zero prior notice, her texts became shorter and the time to answer to mine became longer… To the point that I felt so neglected and pushed aside that I couldn’t see any benefit in the friendship anymore. To this day we haven’t talked since the argument that ended things but I can’t help but wonder how things could just turn so radically by 180 degrees, how someone could be like that to me, and whether there is something that I don’t see (perhaps a significant fault of my own)?

Anyways, thank you Kurzgesagt. I always found it hard to make friends and your video came at the right time. I hope I realize your advice. Wishing everyone lots of love! heart_with_ribbon"
2,Wow thanks for the late night attack on me.
1,So mean :(
1,Relationships are hard to maintain
1, anybody else notice that they used the Breath of the Wild Silent Princess flower?
1,"I got this video recommended to me so now I can type this comment
During the early stages of the pandemic I slowly drifted away from my friends, I ended up from talking to them almost everyday to occasionally joining in on a group call
Whenever I joined they would acknowledge that I was there then stay silent as long as I was there
The pandemic made me think more, and I started overthinking the simplest things
One time when I had joined them, it had been a few months since I actually talked to them, talking to them made me cringe because they usually didn't respond
The whole 9th grade year I stopped talking to them completely
It had been 6-8 months since I talked to them
In 10th grade when we went back to school I thought it would be my chance to reconnect with them
It turns out that only I drifted apart from the friend group and that they had stayed together the whole time
I was depressed and for another 6-8 months I hadn't had a conversation with one of them, anytime they talked to me it would be a question or something that needed a one word response
The longest conversation I had with one of my longest time friends was 15 seconds, after that we haven't talked again
Some acquaintances in the friend group were in some of my classes, I had formed somewhat of a relationship with them but this school year I don't even talk to them, they're not in my class
In some of my other classes I made real new friends and talked to them like my old friends, but now that we're in different classes we don't talk to each other anymore
I hung out with them at lunch in 10th grade, anytime my name came up they would all be silent, it's as if they were remembering all the cringe things I did
They even talk about group chats that they are in, I was in one with them
They said the group chat had died when I was in 8th grade, but I think they made a new one without me
I only have one friend, and they're not even a friend they're someone I talk to during class
I don't know why I hang out with them still
I can't even connect with family members like cousins or siblings, my younger sibling hangs out with cousins his age, same from my older brother
No one my age is friends with me in my family
I don't know if it's the age gap that prevents me from having connections with my family or if I do cringe things like crying at the smallest things or saying something insensitive
I have been so alone I keep saying I will improve myself to make up for it, but I don't, that's a coping method to make me feel better about myself
It has been 3 years since I had a strong friend group
I am so alone
I wanted to die
I want to die
But keep struggling, just to prove to the world that you won't give up
Word of advice: Never give up on your friendships, connect with them right now, I made no effort to and I can never connect with them again. Also, never do cringe things that people will remember. They will think of you as that person, and not for who you really are
okay that's all do what you want with this don't overthink it
shit i need to do my english hw"
1,There is a great book called bowling alone about how people are less social now
1,"I have a friend relationship with a girl i met in elementary school; we are going to call her mia for privacy. we wouldn’t talk much, but when we started high school we discovered more about each other’s interests; we started to talk so much we practically merged our friend groups into a very big one. I am now friends with all the girls and all of the boys from my class, all starting when two elements of two separate groups started to talk. the problem is that during this summer mia started to talk to the “popular” guys. they were being so mean to me and some of my friends that we decided not to stay with them. Mia got invited to the “popular” kids’ parties and fun events so much that she started to forget about us. when we made her notice this she started to stick to both my friend group and the 14 year old “popular” smoking kids group and I feel like that’s ripping her apart. I don’t want to stay with the popular friend group, but I feel like if i don’t, Mia might want to leave us. sorry if this sounds like a vent message, but i’m just asking for an advice :’)"
1,"I don't have any friends because I just got tired of being the only one that could be counted on. I'm that friend who will help you move a body, but it seems that the people who call themselves my friends can't even show up to help me move a sofa. So now I'm alone and I don't trust anyone"
1,"Yes. I agree with most of things you say in this video. But there can be a roadblock for some people, myself included. Fear of society."
2,Youtube knows what to recommend me
1,It is so terrifying channel. Each time I see a video there I get life spoilers
2,I love spicy foods though
2,There is nothing worse than that your best friend is no longer your best friend. You feel like they're dying but they're actually alive.
1,"Being a 25 year old NEET/hikikomori with a college diploma, there's really no social events happening anywhere in my city, and I feel really jailed away in my room. It also doesn't help that I missed the part of my life where I'd usually learn how to form social skills because I was too focused on a computer."
2,". I have zero friends, and that's enough for me."
1,"As someone often considered as an extrovert, I had tears coming up during this video. The justness And benevolence of your video help many of us to live a better Life. Thanks !"
1,It's great that you're manking more videos on mental health.
1,"I've ticked all the boxes over the years (study new things, start new hobbies, etc.) and even though I make new friends, I always lose them as soon as the activity (school, D&D, etc.) is over. It's happened to me with over 7 groups of friends. I'm the one who always reaches out to keep in touch or reconnect and it doesn't work, no one seems to be interested."
1,Today's fact: A duel between three people is actually called a truel.
1,Why did you change the tittle?
1,"""Just remember son
Dont be gay""

1,Friends don't have much of a use these days. We have all kinds of tech and jobs to replace them.
1,You may now know how to get friends but how about you go GET SOME BITCHES
1,"""First of all, dont be a dsmp stan"" /j"
2,I miss when making friends was easy
1,This is just Kurzgesagt telling us to touch grass.
1,Just bought my friend a 1 meter cat plushe for her bd
2,my max amount of friend it only count in one finger  why can we be friend
2,I'm too ugly to make friends.
2,I wish I had a friend.
1,so many depressing videos recently...
1,"My godness, what and incredible and useful chanel."
1,"I think I've spent too long outside the window looking in, I think the doors locked now"
1,Comes up on YT while I'm worrying about losing one of my closest friends...
1,"Do you think this being recommended to me is abusive in itself, i know it is."
1,Kurzgesagt knows it's audience pretty well lol
2,Thanks for the video
0,Welp. They hated jesus because he told them the truth.
1,"I don’t know if Kurzgesagt has done a video on this topic, but I’d love if they did a video on psychedelics"
2,Yeah new video
2,"i am lucky enough to be the good in studies, funny , the loved guy with no haters and to have 20 plus close friends (both girls and boys yes even the girls like me cuz i entertain them)"
2,"Kurzgergat: care and share.

Me: raised_fisttriangular_flag"
1,"So many great points!! I also really liked the subtle inclusion of 3D animated elements in this video, I've been following your team's push to experiment and think it fit into the Kurzgesagt design style well. Fellow birb enthusiasts I look forward to meeting some of you :)"
2,Ya'll that friendless ya'll have to watch video about this good job hope you get a lot of friends
1,"One thing I noticed is that all of these loneliness and stuff are pointed towards introverts and hence introversion is getting a Negative image. 
The basic thing is that introversion and extraversion are the natural traits of every individual and are required in every situation. The cause of loneliness are these unwanted aspects like shyness, ego, fear, being judgemental and such. Although introversion ultimately leads to someone feel lonely, a healthy mindset can always use both introversion and extraversion and find a positive way of living.
The key to a healthy life is to know yourself and your traits, and admit that there is always a difference between you and the remaining world and it is totally normal.

That's from my point of view.."
1,"I don’t want to be alone, I want to be left alone."
1,"But what about online friendships? I've found the only way I can ever make friends is wheen I'm with other people for a lot of time over a period of time, whether in person or not. Many of my friends are from marching band as we are literally forced to be there every day almost all day for most of the summer and then after school for half the school year, it's hard not to make friends in such a setup. But I also have online friends from discord servers where we became friends simply because we were both active a lot on the same server for a period of time, while not as guaranteed as the first example I think it can work just as well at obtaining friendships, as long as you don't mind them being online"
1, that trailer seems familiar... is that the one from Löwenzahn?
1,The F-word.…
1,and now make a video on how to fix my relationship with my girlfriend
1,"Bruh my boyfriend DM'd me saying ""Kurzgesagt made a video for u"" and then sent me this"
1, but what if you don't know who 'you' are? :(
1,man the title was amazing
1,I moved across the country to a new school. I have been struggling with a lack of friends every day since then. Today was especially hard. It helped a lot seeing this when I came home. Thanks!
1,This is literally a cheat book channel at this point
1,"The amount of people in this comment section who find this ""relatable"" is worrying."
1,I'm the opposite I guess.. after the pandemic I stopped hanging out with friends because I learned they were toxic for me.. wrong kind of people. I don't wish to find new ones the coworker friends is enough interaction for me on the daily. I enjoy my weekends to myself as well. 32/Male no kids
2,Kurzgesagt finally figured out why I have no friends?!!?
2,We are all alone it’s just a reality we have to accept
1,"What happens if what is preventing you from socializing is a deep rooted certainty that you have nothing of value to contribute to in an interaction? No specific or wide-ranging knowledge about something, no sharp and perfectly timed humor, no useful or impressive skills, no physical beauty to provide eye candy for others, no economic means to buy others stuff and provide them with an experience of sorts..."
1,this video make me sexist
2,"You guys should be proud of yourselves, your doing great things with your time, thanks for always creating the informative videos we need."
1,"As a late diagnosed autistic woman, I always messed up when trying to make friends with other women, I was too direct and didn't realise that there was a very strict social hierarchy within every group of girls. I wish I had known of my condition sooner, it would have spared me a lot of bullying and self hatred. I'm married to the love of my life now though which makes me very happy. Other women are still too complicated though so I would honestly rather just have dogs than friends haha"
1,I came here to look at the comments lol
2,Ha. I was wondering why I love my coworkers so much and think of them as friends. My career is absolutely personality centered.
1,"İts almost impossible for me to make friends irl. Online is easy and you can meet irl later since you already met and talked. best friends are made when you are kid,as you grow up you focus on life,career,chaos. Im 20 and ı think ı can never make friends bcs ı cant continue my relationship with the people ı met irl"
1,"Recently i just loose one of my biggest friends, he suddenly rejected me or something like that. Right now i'm trying to get a new friend to play games, watch some anime/series or even just talk, but is really hard, I can't believe how hard is to press the send message, invitation, or post button."
1,Why would you choose yo be lonely when you can go to the pound and get a dog? A dog is WAY better than a people.
1,Chill
1,yo wants to be my bestie?
1,Beautiful video. The storytelling animation is so on point!
1,"To be honest, the fact that I'm watching this as a truthful guide makes me sad about myself..."
1,"because this capitalist hellscape makes it hard for most people to find time and energy to make and keep friends, the end."
2,"I'm in love with kurzgesagt videos
Thank you!"
1,"I am an immigrant. What I've noticed is that the natives tend to have circle of friends that were formed during school and college times. These people are really not invested into the idea of making new friends. The same way, I noticed that the physical distance makes people uninterested in keeping in touch after a few years and I've lost many friends I had in my original country. Another element that makes life difficult is to have to work 8 hours a day. No one really wants to hang out afterwards and people often prefer to stay home. Keeping friends like that is a full time job!"
2,"I just wish I could make friends with the people I want to and not just the people that are willing to make friends too, then it would feel like I have at least four friends. Also, I have friends, but why do I feel like they're not? What more do I need from somebody to consider them a friend or do i need more from myself for others to feel like friends...am I making myself lonelier?"
1,Hey friend waving_hand so you also like kurzgesagt huh grinning_face_with_big_eyes
1,As a Indian highschooler who needs to study 10 hours a day just to get a good collage I accept that i have no friends but still sometimes i do feel lonely at times.
1,Just got back from boarding school this helps with motivation to reconnect with old friends
1,"Eh, I’m getting sad. Can you make more space stuff? Jk nice vid as always."
1,Watch Naruto!
1,"Fulltime job. Family. Housekeeping.
I haven't had any friends for 10+ years. When should I ever get any time for that?"
1,The titles just get more savage every upload lmao grinning_squinting_face
1,I don't want to make friends I'm busy selling on Amazon  another's websites
1,"Yeah well , it’s not that easy if your family’s relationship is a rocky one , it makes it much much harder"
1,"me an introvert, insecure, socially awkward, have high standard and values, i cant relate to many. i feel like im the only one like this. i cant afford to hang out with someone that is different than my value or have a high change to change it. also not to mention ithta they can betray you too. someone betray me when i eas a teen, in traumatized me investing time in friendships"
2,I want that kind of video thanks man winking_facewinking_faceslightly_smiling_faceslightly_smiling_face
1,"Working on this currently relieved_face
I've been working on reconnecting with old friends and it's going well!"
1,how to make friends irl as a female in less populated areas  where you can't make your friend's parents pay money because they are EWS and can't afford hanging out . don't suggest public places they are full of perverts and drunkards. maybe i should just be satisfied with internet friends till i move out
1,"the fastest and strongest friendship catalyst, the true reason civilization had emerged is not mentioned, mutual suffering. there is no stronger bond catalyst than suffering and self defencing together from a mutual enemy.  that’s why the greatest friendships are made systems like school, university and the army, systems that doesn’t care about your wellbeing, especially in the army in which ""brother in arms"" bonds are born. the exact same principle is the reason you usually don’t meet your best friend on holydays, vacations etc.. the biggest the hardship the better the bond.. it's our biology"
1,Anybody up for some co-op pc/console gaming?
1,Can we get more science videos instead of these
2,What is this?
1,literally made more friends during corona via discord and online gaming. Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.
1,"That was the most beautiful thing i sae since pandemics started, congrats for this hard work, and thanks for helping me"
2,Another brilliant video - great work K-team!
1,"Biggest thing is finding people who share your passions. I'm big time into sustainability and environmental activism, and my best friends have been met only fairly recently. Many of them I've met through my youtube channel and making vidoes about it, then finding out they are subscribers who are local to me, and we've met up. The connection we have through a shared passion to make the world a better place is like nothing else I've experienced before. It's funny because in our childhoods, our friendships are based on silly things like if they live next to us, or are in our class in school. It's amazing how strong a friendship can be when it's rooted in a shared passion, especially a noble one."
1,"""Dust off your Space Marines"" HERESY - YOU'RE IMPLYING I DON'T FONDLE MY SPACE MARINES EVERYDAY?"
1,Why do I get a feeling this video is  specifically for me....
1,I always second guess making new friends because the fear of losing them constantly eats away at me from the inside
2,From personal experience this is 100% true
1,Wow I'm impressed. A video creator who actually does something for you and gives you an opportunity.
1,I had no idea how much I needed this video.
1,This came right on time for me. Many people in my life sees no problem with not having many friends and look at me weird for craving new connections. Thank you guys so much for this!!!!!! Time to make more fulfilling relationships!!!!!
1,If you 18 and up you need to be having a job fun time is over with.thats what worng with people now thinking they still kids and got to have people looking at them knowing everything they do like a sad puppy man can't wait to humans loose everything
1,It doesn't have to be a lonely world
1,That was personal Kurzgesagt ;(
2,so i have made too many friends. I want less friends than i have now. Does anybody have an idea how to breakup friendships eithout hurting those people
1,"i was a ""central hub"" when i was in elementary school. but after moving away to a different country entirely, everything just fell apart after that.  but now most of my friends are from my work place or i met well after university.  time moves on i guess but it's never the same."
1,felt called out by the title
2,This was posted at the moment I found out I have no friends in my class this year lol
1,But what should I do? I got diagnosed with fortnite 3 years ago and am still a poorly sufferer of this chronic illness. How do I make friends crying_face
1,Maybe I should let them know the value of our friendship and that I want to hangout again even if it's one last time
2,"Online catan game someone ?
The video kind of made me want to play beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes"
1,I'm so excited to say that this weekend there's a meetup in my town thanks to this video!
1,"You know that feeling where you think you're close with the people in the class but when you finally need to start pairing up for projects you get picked last. I've had to deal with that all my life. Always doubting myself and blaming myself that I'm the reason for my loneliness, thinking that people hate me but smiling anyways when you learn they talk behind my back, despite not knowing what on earth I did wrong. Loneliness is such a part of me that I never know what to do nowadays if whether someone wants to genuinely talk to me or me end up being oblivious to social cues that normal people would know among friends. Someone I thought was a good friend even told me I should ""just get used to being alone"" as if I haven't been already doing so my whole life. It's really a different world that normal people dont understand unless you're among the few people who are always the ones left behind."
0,"I know that I am a boring personality, So all avoid me. This helps."
1,"I have this problem, I've had it all my life. I'm always autistic so that doesn't help. I feel lonely and secluded by society. Like I'm just something people laugh at to boost their own self esteem. I have a very hard time making friends. I don't really have any."
1,"I can agree with the pandemic causing serious issues, my son started kindergarten in 2020 and for 2 years he had to deal with virtual learning. He's been extremely excited to go into his in person classes this year."
1,I clicked this so fast
1,A story: Your at the bottom of the class stinkin' even with a A+ according to this meter try another class.
1,Awsome
1,Never thought i will hear about wh40k in a kurzgesagt video
2,Such good videos smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,"Being an INTJ and 96% introvert. I feel it's such a relief that I don't need to be with people, and that I can excuse myself with it only being who I am.
When I was younger, I would always think that I needed to be sociable and extraverted to be successful.

Now I know that I couldn't care less and that's ok thumbs_up

I still want to be with friends, but I don't need to be with one of the 2 friends I have more than two times a year."
1,Kurtzgesagt... Just give me a romance guide and I'll be happy face_with_tears_of_joy
1,"knowing that I need to reach out to people more is something I understand and try to actively do, but so many times it feels like I’m the only person who actually reaches out, which can kill my motivation. methinks the friends I have aren’t really friends."
1,"Im on the otherside of 40. And I have to tell you it is really hard to find friends at this age. There are some unique challenges.

A lot of it has to do with how our lives are ordered by society. People in general are overworked, overscheduled, and overtired.  The video bullseyed that time is one of the big factors in friendship. And we dont have much of it now.  A lot of my friend group is scattered by work all over the world. And they have kids. Not as easy to just say ""hey lets go to this movie"".

Also making friends is tough because it requires a certain amount of proactiveness. Which is in short supply.   My fellow introverts, you know that joke ""where does one find introverts to be friends with? - You cant find them because they are at home hidden"".  It is so hard to be proactive in this way especially when you have anxiety etc. But its not going to fall out of the sky.

Then there is the reciprocity part. Sigh. I became depressed when I realized I was really the only one that contacted others in my friend group. I was never the one reached out to. I have to wonder if they were actually my friends at all or just acquaintances.  Its just a spiral of self doubt....It can take the wind out of your sails."

2,I feel like this was made for me
1,"This video taught me that friendship literally isn't worth it.
Thanks Kurz!"
1,I really appreciate all the effort on a guide on getting it started or restarted but I'd like someone to look into the middle parts of relationships like this. those are the longest parts and some of us do not know what's what in that part.
1,I feel like this is directed towards me.
1,"Coming to video with typing ""how to get friends"" even though you follow kurzegesagt. Damn thinking it made me felt like failure gosh rolling_on_the_floor_laughinggrinning_face_with_sweatsmiling_face_with_tear"
1,Huh. No existential dread? I think this is the first time in a Kurzgesagt video :))))
1,why did this make me cry? :))
1,"this video really comes in handy at this time of my life. I usually take friendship quite seriously and over the past year I felt the best when I spent time with my friends during school, but this on this year's summer break I kind of lost connection with a lot of them. Tomorrow is our first day of school and I'm hoping I get the chance to create new bonds. I'm really glad this video was posted today, great advice kurzgesagt!"

1,Go touch grass
1,"you forgot to mention also childhood obesity has increased up to 30%, and their education has been impacted as well, go look it up, not being able to see mouth movements when talking, is a learning resource you're robbing children from. And the overwhelming evidence of how the vaccine doesn't do anything, social distancing does MORE, but it's worse for you. You being afraid of a virus that they're conflating now with the flu, is not as scary as you think it is. Liberals are a cancer."
2,i feel like this could be helpful but alas i have social anxiety
1,"one of the best things your channel gives is that you guys give a bigger view of life and, suddenly, things don't seem that overwhelming. this is such a nice video! i've been feeling quite lonely recently and been stressing about friends but, making friends is taking a step-- making an effort. it's a dip of ""what can be"" and a small risk that entails a high reward; this has given me more motivation to reach out. thanks!"
1,"I just wanted to comment and say that I appreciate the people at Kurzgesagt for making videos like these regarding sensitive topics. For people who are actually lonely and depressed it’s really nice to see a video like this. Some people might avoid these videos to stay positive and I respect that, which even increases my respect for this channel for still making these videos."
1,"I'm 25 years old, never had friends in my life, I think I rewired my brain to work differently because I don't seek out other people and connections anymore. I just do my own thing, hobbies and do everything by my self. I just have 0 interest in other people and generally avoid any social interactions because it's just a bother."
2,Thanks but i seem to have a curse on me which prevents me from having friends.
2,"Idk why, but i like being alone."

1,"Seeing videos like this does make me feel bad for people who are lonely, although it does make me smile knowing I'm not among them, it took years to find my friends and they were all through luck alone, I earned the happiness that they give me and my journey is over"
2,YAY I CAN GET FRIENDS NOW!!!!
1,"As someone who turned his life over this year and invested so much into new circles and friendships I can say this might be the most solid Kurzgesagt video up till now
Go for it people!"
1,I'll save this in case I forget how to make friends. I've been introvert years ago but I push myself to go out with friends when there's a chance. Life is short but time spent with them is shorter so I make the most out of it.
2,Great now I'm feeling called out

1,Ain't nobody got time for friends.
1,"Ironically I feel so much less lonely since I've decided I don't want friends. I do have a handful of chosen family... But beyond that parasocial relationships with YouTubers is more than enough.... And the disconnected aspects is what makes them accessible. And doesn't come with the same sense of feeling lonely around ""friends""."
2,"Thank you, Kurzgesagt. I can’t spell your channel name but thank you."
1,Now tell me how to get a girlfriend
1,"You lost me at .
These women with their Yoga mats drive me crazy.
Sometimes I think about yelling at them asking if they don't want to have a real life with real love and - yes - real sex."
1,The facial expressions are getting finer and more relatable :D
1,I always find these videos amazing (highlight of the day when it drops). Today I'm just like...so what does it mean for me if I didn't keep one friendship alive my whole life. Got to go out and keep trying I guess
1,I started a thing with my friends during covid where we sit on discord every Tuesday and talk about our live. What happened that week etc. It helps to stay in touch you are up to date and people are much easier to get a hold of.
2,thank you kurzgesagt because recently I have been feeling quite lonely I think this will really help thank you for this

1,"As someone whose social desires and success with friendships has fluctuated wildly over the years, I'd say the advice in this video is super solid.

1,My biggest thing that prevents me from finding friend is terrible and simple : I dislike drinking alcohol :P
1,I don't have any close friends. Just nothing. Thanks for the encouragement
1,"It's annoying that life isn't automatically good, you have to have money, friends, relationships, family, a job you enjoy, security,  you need all that just to be okay, and even then you can still be miserable. It takes a lot to be happy but so little to be unhappy, overall I think we have more suffering in our life than pleasure, being alive is automatically a negative."
1,This is exactly what i need
1,"Of course this isn't helping for people like me with ASD, I could try to make friends in class all the time but hardly ever get any progress"
1,Not ANOTHER Kurzgesagt video that has me crying loudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_face
1,What if you enjoy your own company? People ALWAYS come with drama and if I keep to myself I only have one person’s drama to deal with. It’s like friendship is merely a mechanism through which people outsource the drama in their lives.

2,"damn,this video is so true lmao i have losed all my friends atleast the ones who were really close to me"
1,You really had to watch this L+bozo+ratio+cope
1,"As a 40+ year old, I say basically the problem is, that over time, it all gets to the point where you are actually being taken advantage of. You just give and give and give, but get very little in return, or are simply not seen as an !equal! partner. Why? Because you're kind, you're understanding, you're compromising, but a brutally large percentage of people are selfish bastards. They don't care at all what you like, what you are like, what you care about. The only chance you have is your family, but obviously there are exceptions where your family is worse than your enemy. So, dear friends: just go and quack yourselves!"
2,last year i realized I'm not good at the whole friends things- Im glad I have this video now
2,"""No friends""face_with_raised_eyebrow"

Alot of people often forget to appreciate that they have many close friends to hang out with before its too late. Hope everyone's friendship can last forever including me :)

1,This is a thoughtful and timely video.
1,"Too much work
I'd Rather die than be involved with these centre circle ppl toxic ass self-cest maniacs nauseated_face"
1,"If 10 million people watch this video (fairly reasonable for Kurzgesagt) and 1 in 10 of them are motivated to either seek out a new friendship or revitalize on old one, then Kurzgesagt will have created/saved 1 million friendships. Way to go guys!!"
1,"I think accepting that I will not have the same friends throughout my life was one of the best things for me. I will hold onto someone if I can (and I've managed to keep a few 15+ yr long friendships now as  a 31 y/o), but I accept that sometimes life just takes you in different directions, and you're simply not going to be as close anymore. And that is OKAY. You don't need to have any malice or a grudge against the other person. Life is complicated and people are complicated. 

I feel like you have different like.. tiers of friends. There's active friends that you're seeing/talking to pretty often (once a week or so) and seldom friends and old friends that range from maybe once a month to a year or so. I dunno. I am just one of those people you can go 6 months to a year not talking to and then we'll have like a 5 hour conversation catching up. I've made many friends in my life but I don't have time for all of them! I would never get anything done lmao 

So you gotta be okay with some friends being less close after a while, but you can still cherish what you had. You can still try to check up one one another, maybe have lunch or something if you can. But it's okay and they're still your friend, maybe you're schedules or lives will line up again at some point to spend more time together. :T"
1,Also YouTube nerds WhatsApp group..
1, man that is some INSANELY good advice that ive literally never heard anywhere else. So meaningful man :D
1,POV:when ur early and dont know what to say
1,"Another great video.
Big props to the artist behind your music, it's been very good lately"
1,No matter the people i meet that have almost the same interest as me in discord or social media i seem to be annoying cause i tend to talk which makes people hate me so stopped trying to talk and make friends it honestly feels annoyingly sad for me
1,This video got posted literally on my first day of college
1,"Always great seeing Zelda references in Kurzgesagt videos, the Silent Princess is a beautifully designed flower"
1,"Back to school was yesterday, there was a lot of new students in my class.
I would consider myself pretty sociable although I've had a bit of a rough time last year. A new dude sat infront of me and my buddy and no one sat next to him  until a girl moved next to him. I was aware of how he could feel so I am trying my best to make him comfortable and stuff"
1,"This is bull. A lack of social connection is related to diseases?!?! Where the fuck are you getting your information from? I chose to be alone...   I have masked and tried to spend time 'with people in the real world' where did that leave me? Abused by the outside world leaving me broken broken_heart my body was used and abused I was kicked, beaten up,  had my veins injected into, by a friend I thought I could trust, been raped on several occasions, my emotions and feelings being dismissed by my family I am also autistic, does that make me diseased? NO. No wonder I don't like the outside world and you are proving in this video exactly why I don't like the outside world, with your bloody bias, insensitive remarks."
1,"i need a direct ""how to get a girlfriend in 2022"" video from Kurzgesagt"
2,"I have friends
Why am I watching this"
1,This was posted mere HOURS after I confided in a new friend that I have sobbed recently about not having friends and wanting genuine connections... and HOURS after I showed that same new friend The Egg video and the one about Space Elevators. The synchronicity is wild...
1,"Is it weird if I feel... fine with no friends? Like I don't really feel lonely, I enjoy my individual hobbies and you can even have interesting conversations once in a while with people you never meet again. I feel envious sometimes when I see people hang out with friends and think it would be nice to have someone to count on, but I don't feel lonely 90% of the time."
1,"I really, really value my solitude. A person, who I'm willing to spend time with, rather than be alone, has to be really, really interesting, fun, trustworthy and clever. This is why I'm alone most of the time."
2,Great work guys thanks I wish I had a good friend but having a disability makes it difficult to get out  and meet people grinning_face
1,"I used to be bullied my entire life in school, 99% of my class mates would bully me in some shape or form, anytime I try to make friends, it didn't work, this has caused me to stay by myself most of the time and play lots of video games and chat with random people online on discord or twitter (trying to do anything entertaining), yes I did talk with them a lot but they're not close friends, all of this has affected me to this day, I am nearly 21 years old, approaching last year in college and I still have no real friends, ik my college mates are not bullies and they're good people but still can't make friends with them"
2,I love this channel.
2,Great video. Thanks
1,"WWHO WANTS TO BE MY FRIEND please be in my dm, aka comment section via typing..."
1,"Thank you, this video really really helps(ed) me out, as i just moved for work and lost close to everything everything."
1,Kurzgesagt has taught me how to make friends more than my parents ever did.
1,"A LOT of you spend so much time on social media and ya’ll know it lmao

I do too that’s why watching this video hurt because I feel like it’s “easier” to sit on the couch after a long day at work and just browse YouTube or Reddit to unwind. 

The thought of driving to my dads house who is just 5minutes away seems so much of an effort because I feel mentally drained and exhausted toward the end of my day."

1,"I have some friends, we used to spent time togetherly once, but nowadays, it is getting harder for me to maintain connection with them, becouse I feel like our personalities are taking defferent directions, I'm more likely belongs growing mindset, learning new skills, art and craft, another one is mobile gamer and meme lover, another one is taking drugs nowadays, another one is married at this little age, when I sit with them, I feel nothing to share with them, cause I know they're not interested in any of my topic, I just listen and just stay silentface_without_mouth"
1,"; DnD, 40k and MTG were massive in getting me out of the house at first. Once I started to get out, I realized how many people there and how great it is to spend time with people. I also got really lucky and my best friend of like 13 years is really outgoing and brings friends to me!"

2,I want to make friends there? where are you?
1,When did this become a self-help sociology channel? ugh
1,"I am 31 years old and don't have anyone I can call a friend even can't imagine myself living in the same room with a person. Friendship is something that can't have whatever I go to, gym, work, neighborhood, and social media."
1,"An important note is to not stress about 'where' your friendships are. By this, I mean that you may have some friends, but with whom you're not super intimate, and when you see other friendships you might wonder just why you can't reach that level of intimacy. For one thing, such tight relationships are always cultivated over the span of many years, and also, not all friendships work in exactly the same way. Don't put pressure on yourself to make that super-intimate friend, because the odds are that you're going to blow it. You will make a deeper connection eventually, but you need to give it time and effort, and especially, realize that it'll probably take a specific kind of person that clicks with you. Don't be overbearing or pushy, that's a fast track to getting ejected from social circles.

And like Kurzgesagt said, play the role of host. Few people want to host gatherings - it's a lot of work. But everyone loves a good host, and will happily accept invitations. It takes practice, and you're probably going to do poorly the first few times, but once you get the hang of it it becomes much easier. Being the host will give you ample opportunities to meet other people, and to deepen friendships."
1,You have no idea how much I need this vid
1,Way to call us edgy teenagers out buddy
1,"The theme you have no friends is pretty common and involves many people, so you can start a conversation with it. It would be funny if someone connected to another one because they couldn't connect"
1,School stops friends ships and rarely encourages them
1,This isn't accurate for those of us suffering from autism/aspergers :/

1,"Kurzgesagt used to be educational, now it's just cringey clickbait."
1,"This sounds so great, but interests are harder than it sounds. Gaming is a good example, a 20yo who plays call of duty is different from a 60 year old who plays candy crush, who's different from the hardcore rpg fans. I've also had great online friends, who I would trust more than some relatives, and who've hurt to lose for over a year now.

Then you have to factor in mental illnesses you might have that throw up a roadblock also. I got booted from a group I loved because I'm autistic and don't communicate with others well. I still talk to a few people from it, but trying to find another group with such a niche interest has been impossible over the last year.

It's something I've been hyperfixated on, so just ""switching gears"" won't be possible unless I find a new one.

I guess all I can really say that'll be helpful is PLEASE be patient with people who have mental conditions and if, say, an autistic person does or says something wrong, please explain it to them so they can adjust the behavior. They can't fix what they don't know is broken. If someone is depressed, let them vent a bit, sometimes they just need some sympathy, or ADHD can make people both hyperfocus on one thing for hours or get distracted by any number of trains of thought. Patience is key."

1,"Some people just like loneliness; life is a journey, there is not a ""standard"" way to be applied to everyone."
1,"Plz do one on how to minimize socialization and human interaction, I could do with a lot less humans in my life"
1,this is Kurzgesagt's way of telling you kids to GET OFF THEIR BACK ABOUT NEW VIDS. GET OUT AND GET SOME SUNSHINE!
0,2.4m lonely people
1,Anyone make any new friends since this video was posted? No? Me either.
0,I think a lot of the very lonely people are weird people no one wants to be friends with. My friend that’s constantly sad sucks to be around and just complains about his life
1,I'm 25 and I have been lonely most of my life I feel like it's too late. The people my age already have their friend group and I have nothing.
1,Everyone is a wiener :D
1,I was depressed when starbucks was open and there was no social distancing. everyone else who got sad after pandemic are just jumping on the trend to be sad
1,"Remeber kids, Friendship is Magic, but Magic is HERESY!!! Stop with that foolishness, the only thing you need is God Emperors will.... and some Brothers to play with.
Edit: You niedzielę Brothers to play warhammer 40K obviously..."
1,"Hey, to whoever is reading this if you have no friends, what helped me get more friends was firstly learning to be my own friend. This may sound cliché but bear with me. When you learn to do cool activites that you enjoy by yourself (going to the store, going to the cinema, club, park you name it) you'll likely start being happier. Hapiness attracts people. So when you'll feel ready you can try to invite some people to join you. If they can't well, you'll do the activity anyways. If you have nobody to invite, try to join a club or take classes. Martial Arts, Art groups, Book groups etc. This way you'll get to know new people and when you'll feel confortable, perhaps try to invite them to join you. The key is to not stay lonely. You can be alone but not lonely. So yeah, hope it can help someone."
1,"Your videos are awsome and are helping so much people, including me. I am very thankful for the existence of Kurzgesagt. Big cheers from Colombia - South America"
1,"Animation in this was beautiful, I loved the little story you told on the side with the recurring characters sparkling_heartsparkling_heart"
1,I wish people would have been sympathetic when I was always quiet and alone in school.
1,me reading the title knowing that i have friends: those bastards lied to me
1,Why I'm alone? Because I want to.
1,I have very few friends and I'm not worried at all. I guess it's time to touch grass.
1,"I don't want to make new friends, people are shallow, selfish things. No thanks."
1,this animation has a higher FPS than actual life.
1,"I just ""broke up"" with my only friend a couple of hours ago and I got this video got recommended to me wtf loudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_face"
1,thanks and the video hasn't started yet
1,that was a really long commercial for your store
1,Man that dust off your spacemarine thing  is probably what i should do.
1,"Extreme introverts being perfectly content with no human friends and a lot, and I mean a lot, of potted plants:"
1,Nowadays kurzgesagt does better content that “informative” tv programs
1,"Since being homeless I've tried making friends, but they only want to know my line of studies and what cities I like. Basically an information grab. I thought the sane thing to do while homeless was get on your feet. But according to my atmosphere I need to be making friends and telling my life plans to strangers."
2,"Wow, algorithm, you know me so well!"
1,Joining a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu club allowed me to make some of the greatest friends I could ask for. It's hard not to be friendly with someone that's been choking you out for 90 minutes...
1,So basically 4million people are lonely
1,"I'm crying so bad these past few weeks cause my father died, and I wasted time that could have been precious memories as father and son. If I could only have one friend. I'd want my dad back. It's too painful. I have so many regrets.."
1,"totally clicked because it's by Kurzgesagt, not because of the title ;D"
0,"i feel happy even without much friends, is it ok or should i get more friends?"
1,I don’t even have to watch the video to know it’s good
1,"There's a great book on how to talk to strangers or re-establish old friendships called ""Small Talk Small Ideas: Fifty Ways to Have a Deep Conversation""."
2,"Can you make a video about finding love, I still haven’t kissed anybody and I’m 19"
2,I don't want any because people suck
1,"I feel like a robot, being taught to be a human"
1,I just find it sad that everyone in school is as the video says on their phone because of Tik Tok and not socializing with people in the real world. This is one of the reasons I don't like Tik Tok (just my opinion) which makes it harder to talk to classmates.

1,Oh dayum. Am I in a mid life crisis? All the steps sounds so exhausting to perform xD
1,Or I can further develop my coping strategies and bury the issue. Sounds like less work.
2,What if I want to be alone and don’t want friends?
0,Why the hell was I recommended thid at 4 am lmao. I'm not even a loner.
1,"I'm not saying social interaction is bad but I do think people put far too much emphasis on social validation which is not a good thing. 

If you need people to have a feeling of importance or self worth, then you're a slave to what ever those people want from you. If you make yourself completely open to everyone and nobody is open to you, then they don't care about you. I used to have many many friends or so I thought. But I felt empty after repeatedly giving my time and energy to people who were never reciprocal. 

Stop calling or talking to people and see how long it takes for someone to ask you where you've been. I can almost guarantee that if you do have a large group, 95% of them will never notice you left and they'll never reach out to you again. In my case none of them did.

I did make new friends but I was very selective this time around. I'd rather have 4 quarters than 100 pennies. High value people make your life better, not the number of people."
2,"I’ve been alone for too long, now I take interest in my adorable dog who is more loyal than my friends who’ve ghosted me for no reason. I have a bad point of view on humanity so this doesn’t help at all.."

2,In other words: Friendship is Magic <3
2,Love this initiative. People like us really needed this push. Thanks Kurzgesagt.
1," simple solution find neurodivergent and/or queer people, hard to overshare if it fairly habitual/standard to immediately talk about the most personal aspects of life and become great friends within an incredibly short period of time! We’re speed running making friends! At least when we actually manage to find and then talk to each other"
1,"well perhaps I should although most of my friends are online and I haven't been outside in 2 days lol, I made a social app but tbh I just didn't feel like it I do wonder if it's bad for me but I feel like I'm in a place rn where I need to focus on myself"
2,Thank you internet man
1,"""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.""   
 -John 
God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. 

We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him. 
We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins. 

He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven

Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends
Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.


May God Bless you all!"
1,"Me, an introvert: how bout

1,"I LITERALLY FEEL LIKE THIS VIDEO WAS MADE FOR ME, THE TIMING IS EVEN RIGHT LMAO"
1,I find conversations really frustratingdisappointed_face. I hate it when I feel like people I talk to aren't interested in what I talk about.
1,"Friends are over rated because people that hang out with you are doing it fir an ulterior motive like sex, money or social upward mobility. Especially if they are Russian. ;)"
2,ok is there anybody who wanna make friends with me?nerd_face
1,anyone wanna be my friend...
1,The fact that 1.5 million people clicked this.............
2,i didn’t need to be called out but sure
1,"4.7 millions views, 272k like, 15k comments after only 4 months!!! We are on the same boat. We need FRIENDS but it's so hard, it's like finding a spouse. We're all on mobile phone searching for what?"
1,Simple solution: don't watch kurgestaught
1,"You might as well make these stories available in pdf. I love watching videos on this channel. The videos are very instructive, but I also use the channel to practice English."
1,"I'm eighteen who is a lonely person. Recently I just play video game long and loooong time. The region is i dont have any friends. So i cannot do anything.. some time i such as friend from middle school.
They are look like respectable adult. 
When I do it.. i think im so idiot person of on myself

2,It’s like a collection of my advices presented near and great. I win so many shy people simply by interacting with them. If you want a friend I’m available <3
2,0 friends since 2015.
0,This video feels like a massive insult
2,How to make friend explainwd for people who like science
1,One of the questions I ask myself constantly is what would happen to my consciousness after i died.
1,Am I the only one who goes out of my way to be alone?
1,"But friends also bring drama and huge issues. I’m so focused on trying to lookout for my future, I don’t care about friends. This video fails to state how friends can drain you in a negative way getting nowhere. He said “mindless games”. I think of motivated routes to something better"
1,"How am i so fast ? face_with_tears_of_joy
......Is what I thought till i saw 41 comments....ITS BEEN 18 SECONDS !! 41 people clicked this video faster than me....who got here just 18 seconds after the vid was posted ??? How???
This just makes the video title even more sad....how many lonely people like me are out there ? face_with_tears_of_joy rolling_on_the_floor_laughing"
1,Im so glad that she include Warhammer 40k in his video.
1,I have friends.... They're just fictional... From someone else's fiction... Too tired to make my own imaginary friends.
2,I wish I was an extrovert :(
2," I can confirm, this is true"
0,now how do i get bitches
1,"It's kinda scary to see and realise just how many lonely people there are on this planet.
Only if there was a way for many or all of them to find each other and hopefully, stray away from their loneliness. That would be sweet honestly."
1,Finally! Some useful video!
1,"I tend to struggle with the shared interest part. There are some things that I’ve liked for a good while and likely will for a large part of my life, like music and roller coasters, but I’ll also have really temporary interests that I’ll spend a lot of time on. Then I’ll make friends that stick with those interests far after I’ve grown tired of them. Like, I have a friend and, for a while, we would play Minecraft together just about every night. I’ve stopped playing Minecraft in my free time though, and I honestly find it a little draining to play at times, but he still messages me a ton asking to play it. I try to get on when I can, but I also tend to take just about any excuse not to play. I feel bad about it. It also doesn’t help that I live in a pretty small town with a bit less than ~150 people my age, and a lot of the time it seems like there’s nobody I share any interests with, or even have an interest in. I’m sure I’ll be alright though, there are still a small handful of people I really like and enjoy being around, and my connections will only grow as I age. Sorry for a really long and ramble comment and the somewhat cheesy comment at the end, but it felt good to vent."
2,I found out your best friends are people who are the exact opposite of you. Usually only a couple things in common that make that bond. Best friends just complete eachother
1,"I’m 32 and still have no friends. I’ve come to the conclusion that having no friends at my age is clearly my fault. I think i better pay attention to this video.

Although, tomorrow I’m getting a new friend! A blue heeler puppy smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes"
1,I gell like the universe is trying to tell me something...
1,strange thing is so many who watched this video still i struggle to make friends coz all the people i look my daily look like they are so complete on their own and happy to be alone
1,Use this comment as a bring back physics video
1,this was the hardest video to click on ive ever had to click but i will probably be glad i watched this
2,So who here wants to be my friend :)
1,definitely needed this
1,"In the final scene of Stephen Spielberg’s AI, the aliens regret the loss of humanity. So they came back to the past and started making this videos… thank you"
1,"It's going to be ok. And another thing... If there's a hobby you're interested in or you've always wanted to try, then you should pursue it as soon as possible. If you don't get into it, that is ok. If you do fall in love with it, it can change your life."
1,"We want all the music from Kurzgesagt, Please"
2,I don’t have a lots fwriends cus I seem to fit in that well :/
1,People are lonely because we have completely allowed technology to replace human interactions.
1,You guys are awesome!
2,What ?
1,"Mmm... sorry, I can't agree.  Having friends isn't important at all and it is mostly a huge waste of time and money, sometimes it can even be dangerous. The older I get, the more aware I am that  the world is filled with self-absorbed back-stabbing  leeches. It's just human nature, it's a jungle out there folk! Take good care of yourself and limit interactions to necessity or courtesy. Good luck! red_heart"
1,"*this topic ironically More Heavier than involving Alien, Humanity and Universe...because how easy it is to relate and close to our life...everyone i hope you all find a meaningfull friend and coping with loneliness in healthy way...Peace victory_handand Pray palms_up_together*"
1,i dont find it hard to make friends its just hard to find the right people that dont do you dirty
2,"I want friends I actually share hobbies and interests with. But the friends I have now are on a whole different outlook in everything that it feels like I really don’t have any friends because I can’t share the music, shows, topics, and hobbies I love without being seen as weird or different. It’s tough"
2,this video was really helpful thank you
1,Yet another thing that explains me why time is my biggest stress generator.
1,"The sad thing is, that baltic states are not mentioned in the subreddit :("
2,"I want to k myself.
This was not helpful at all."
2,I’m just watching for a friend not me at all of course…

0,All this video did was make me feel even more lonely and sad.
1,I dont reach out now . They got tired of me and it shows
0,This video is so fucking important. Thank you for making it.
1,Un spicy food has nothing to do with introversion face_with_tears_of_joy like I get being over stimulated but is that from a survey of white Americans? Because I’m a latina and spicy food is cultural no matter how much we socialize

2,Thanks I need to know I know how to make friends thanks 11!1!!1!!1!1!!

1,Literally popped up the day I started university
1,I JUST WATCHED THE LONELINESS VIDEO rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
1,"It's Just absurd how kurzgesagt reach this level of content by talking a spicy topic, you guys are just unique, never stop"
1,I'm not lonely but I sometimes think about what if I'm not able to get more friends later on in life if the ones I have end up leavin
1,"Man, why this gotta show up on my feed?  loudly_crying_face"
2,What are friends?
1,"So glad this video talked about reciprocity. I know full well about the importance of learning about others, reaching out and asking people to hang out, etc, but the other person has to do this, too. I’ve had plenty of one-sided friendships and don’t have the time for that kind of thing anymore. I deserve to be reached out to, too!"
1,"Although we are more connected than ever, we have also never been more disconnected. The masks people wear on social media for all to see is just a second of time in their everyday lives. The rest is held in secret for none to see.

My advice to anyone feeling down. Seek the medical help and mental help that you need. Get off social media for a bit. You don't have to delete the accounts, just the apps from your phone. Do literally anything else.

Mental health is hard and my journey has not been easy, but it is possible for you to be happier. YOU can do it! You ARE strong enough. And you are LOVED; even if you can't see it now.

Godspeed and remember. Sadness is nothing to be scoffed at, but this too shall pass."
2,"That title is mean, I have a lot of friends! I have one friend! That's a lot!"
1,I’m gonna apply the tips from this video. I’m tired of being alone.
1,"Friends are fleshlings that have yet to *$%# you over.

At a higher level of intellect there is no need for ""friends"" 
Do you think a matrioshka brain wants or needs ""friends""

With such a basal ""thought"" process you'll be sent to the blood refineries."
1,"i am not lonely youtube, don't recomend that to me"
1,I think I became bipolar during the pandemic.
2,Literally had a mental breakdown barely 24 hours ago about how little friends I have now. This helped so much. Thank you.
2,It's too late and there are no friends to be found.
2,anyone wanna be friends?
1,This video is full of lies and misleading ideas... In reality the friendships are impossible to make…
1,"I'm 51....and I trust people far less now, then I had ever before. Life is brutally hard, and we need eachother. Would be nice if people could chill out, and we can talk to eachother, again. I dunno...GenX'rs may get my apprehension.victory_hand_medium_skin_tone"
1,fuc it we ball
2,Do more videos like this one
1,What would this topic look like if you lived in the real world?  This is NOT how freindships work in today's day and age.  Most friendships don't work.  People can't even hold a 15 second conversation anymore.  Trying to make new friends after college?  You won't
1,"What a world we live in today, when a bunch of nerds is telling everyone else how to make friends."
2,thanks i needed this
1,Yo youtube got my back with these passive aggressive reccomendations
1,"> the city I live in is boring
> My school doesn't have any social activities other than rare and very expensive tours, where you just a go to a city and walk around.
> My classmates are interested in almost nothing. They just think about their lessons and few popular video games that I'm not interested in (Fortnite, Pubg etc.)
> Most people around me don't even know English, so they don't understand the jokes I make that are mostly coming from internet. People don't laugh to lame/cliche real life jokes since they've been hearing them for years. And I don't follow current Turkish internet.(I live in Turkey)
> Some of my friends don't have computers, so it's hard to play PC games as friends. And there aren't many mobile online games that can be played by my friends. Most of my classmates aren't even interested in games.
> Most of my classmates are complete lazy introverts. I'm not saying that I'm not, but the chance of them refusing my offer to do something together is very high since they usually find social activities lame.
> Most people around me are unresponsive when I message them online. Its hard to communicate."
1,"I love the video but I don't find it to help with my situation unfortunately, I am somewhat of an extrovert and I have lots of casual friends, but I struggle to form close friendships, since I live in an area where my world view crashes with the culture and thus most people's world view, so I find myself distancing from people as I get to know them cuz I start to like them less and less"
1,i think the algorithm is trying to tell me something
1,"I dropped my friends 10 years ago, i never felt alone or lonely. If you are comfortable with yourself. Reduce friends as much as you can. Spend more time with your family instead"
1,yehhh but sometimes being alone feels good tho..
1,"...The problem is the reason I don't have many friends is because most of the people I got to know somewhat were either annoying, overly girly, or straight up had very different wants and desires from mine. I'm too picky. :("
1,"I don't know the proper name for it, but that bottle-like kick in the music sounds amazing."
1,"As a 23yo man, I LOVED the Sade reference during the introverts preferences clip ;)"
1,The worst part is I'm too lazy to go and engage in a meetup.
1,As an extra-terrestrial this information has gifted me the ability to further communicate with the humans
1,This video is so relevant for me right now. I left school in 2020 and have been attending college since. Most classes were virtual so I didn't have many opportunities to make friends. And I also let many old friendships die. Hopefully this video's advice helps me.
2,A group of 3 friends is an ideal one

1,Kurzgesagt saying all their viewers are lonely

1,I haven't made a new friend since College. Life has taken me all over the place in 6 years and I've mostly lost touch with all the friends I did have. Now I'm 28 years old and I'm convinced that I will die alone. I'm only able to go on living unnaturally through antidepressants. I can't even bring myself to watch this video because it just reminds me of everything I don't have and I don't believe I will ever have anymore.
1,"After recovering from opioid addiction for 2 years it’s the hardest thing ever to reconnect to “friends” I’ve once had and managed. But once I fell off the grid none of them tried to reach out first or gave off the feeling of having to put in more effort than before, my mind being as pessimistic as it it takes that in a different direction and gives me another excuse as to not try to rekindle our friendship.. I guess it’s time to meet entirely new people."
1,Sometimes you gotta be just crazy enough to be your own friend.
2,The animations are cute and wholesomered_heartloudly_crying_face
1,"One of the most revealing moments in my life was when I, with the help of my friends and my psycologist, realized that I'm not an introvert, as I had thought for a long time, but a shy extrovert with (at the time) very little practice in social relationships, as I generally thrive spending time with people I know. Making friends has been the pivotal step in steping out of my depression and one of the best things I've ever done."

1,"I'm a 44y/o straight-single man in NYC. I grew up on Long Island, and the few friends I have (from High School days) are still out there. I was part of NYC social scenes & circles for several years in my 30's, and the last friends standing that I have any meaningful relationships with, are my old HS friends. These days, we see each other about 4-6 times a year. I'm very introverted, but if I am with others its easy to open up. It still didn't make much of a difference. I'm still only friends with a core few. I now work a 9-5, go home, watch youtube, play video games, play guitar, and record some music. I've come to accept that this is the way life is, and to be at peace with it. - If you don't have any hobbies, find or pursue one. It will help equalize your life."
1,"Me as introvert: Friends, ""fun activities"" with people, talking - is like absolute hell for me xD Pure desolation, far away , silence and peace and quiet  with no people around is what prevents ME from being depressed. Like with access to the internet and social media to me is all I need. I decide when to talk to people aka write and when I want to stop. No annoying direct exchange needed. I can have my doze of social activity measured as I need. WIth real life people this is impossible"
2,Thank you red_heart this definitely helps
0,fuck friendship
1,"This is funny coming from a channel which so readily endorsed policies like, 'social distance'. Let's be honest, social distancing was as effective at mitigating the spread of the virus as the vaccine. In spite of all the harmful things society did, everyone got covid, some of them died but most of them didn't."
1,"I also notice that the strategies most likely to work when maling friends can be very different depending on the culture. I felt that in Brazil it might be easier to make friends with coworkers or neighbors, while in US I only got to get some friends after finding hobbies like volunteering or even if it's something a bit silly like Pokemon Go."
0,Freinds are for the weak.
1,"This is one of those times I really am grate for a childhood before the rise of smartphones. Days really did seem to go by slower, every kid in our neighborhood was playing outside after school, we all knew each other and our parents knew each other through us going over after riding bikes, basketball (using a stop sign as the ""goal""), or some random game we would play outside. That's why anytime we get a chance, we go to my country in Africa to show the kids some real fun... OUTSIDE and a chance to experience what we did cause it's so similar... a chance to get away from quiet suburbia where all the kids are indoors and neighbors can barely make eye contact."
1,We have Facebook and Instagram. We are so connected
1,"I have literally zero people I can reach out and talk to. I have no friends or family, and I've spent the last decade alone. It feels natural to me to be alone but I know it's not. I feel stuck in this state but hope it's not like this forever."
1,It’s really cool to think about the amount of lifetime friends that are going to be made from this video.
1,"I am so glad I was born in a time where cellphones didn't exist in schools. You'd know where your friends were after school by looking for all their bikes were parked - if you called their home phone and they weren't home. Covid is nothing but oppression, and a gross overreaction to a ONE PERCENT MORTALITY RATE resulting in adverse mental health effects world wide."
1,Meh... friends are over-rated. I hang out with my wife and dogs. That's pretty much all I need in the world.
1,This was literally posted mere moments after I sent a text to somebody about how lonely I’ve been feeling so I am now fully convinced kurzgesagt is in my walls

Videos like this just make me more depressed."
1,"I have a really difficult time making friends. It’s been this way my entire life but it’s becoming more clear as I get older. On the rare occasion that I do become friends with someone, it goes one of three ways: 1. One of us moves away very soon after meeting (for example, I became good friends with a new girl at my job this summer and then a week later I left for college in another state), 2. I become friends with a group but over time they start to exclude me more and more (so I am currently living with five other girls that I’m supposed to be friends with but they have a group chat without me and they always go hang out together without inviting me), or 3. They just randomly start ghosting me for literally no reason. There’s almost never a fight, I never talk trash about my friends, nothing happens. People just seem to wake up one day and decide to never talk to me again. That’s the way most of my friendships end. Every time I make a new friend (which is rare but does happen once in a while) I just expect that they won’t be around for very long and I’m usually right, though I usually hope they’ll stick around. I really only have two friends that I’ve known for 5+ years, and in both of those friendships there was a period of a few years where we were no longer friends, but then we reconnected. What do I do about this? How do I get people to not leave me? If anyone has any suggestions, I would really appreciate it. I genuinely don’t know what I’m doing wrong."

1,"Not everyone need friends. Some people prefer fewer social connection and or say burden. If you love making friends, go ahead. If you like staying alone being yourself, no need to give in to social pressure to appear ""normal"" having friends. Don't waste your precious time and energy on something you are not good at making and maintaining."

2,"This has come at a very important time for me. I'm doing a gap year and most of my friends are going to university this year. I want to make more friends before uni, so this should be really helpful! Thank you :))"
1,Sadly I’ve lost all my friends from this pandemic I never had their phone numbers or their Snapchat though I don’t know where they are which is really sad though I’m assuming they moved to different states already though I have to say that I mostly have internet friends from different countries and they might come here to the USA in the future though I also want to have friends from different countries especially right now with one internet friend from India and I’m hoping he comes here to the USA to have a good life

1,"Ppl used to put up with each other through high and lows but now we cant beceause we are annoyed by the smallest of thing. Meaning our annoyance tolerance is getting smaller and having a friend makes things more difficult, if you dont have free time."
1,I had to refresh my screen like 3 times. I couldnt believe this was posted today. I had a crisis yesterday surrounding how lonely I feel. Thank you for posting this.
1,"And what you do when you get rejected over and over? Explicitly? Through years?
Tried all of this. Don't work."
1,"Funny enough I've slowly developed the ultimate key to making friends or even become the most popular guy in a school.
 I can't teach you it entirely but to learn this yo must be extremely empathetic even to animals, be patient as it takes a long while , you also have to be rather smart , and don't act desperate in any case.
 if you qualify in all these you can start learning it. you have to guess peoples mind and form super strict boundaries to not seem weird.
 there are 2 systems in a person mind system one and system two you have to learn to guess their minds which involves months of studying simple minding people and yourself to make it easier always put thought into your actions after a few months of learning you should be able to guess people minds with good accuracy and their responses through simple feeling if or if not.

Through these you should be able to slowly learn all that I know through trying once your done with this making friends should be easier.



now to being the most popular person in a school you need basic items like a phone to remain in contact and join clubs like sports forming a friend group of fair 7 to 12 can make rising to the top easier obviously having the latest stuff will help and watching your look.
to boost your groups reputation good interaction with other people is key this means choosing your groups member is vital to be friendly and always good natured to themselves others in the group.
if your group is seen as top you can start boosting your looks to the highest maybe exercise, facial care,
hair gel, or others.
you should be around one of the most popular people in the school now there are some things you should avoid to not lose your status like not being a jerk,having a girl/boy friend and being mentally impossible to break into (which should be easy since the resilience you get when you learn the earlier training).

I think this is enough typing in one sitting if all this typing and information I've put here isn't enough to earn me a like I don't know what is hope this helps people and that it doesn't spread to too many people
only one king/queen in every school after all."
0,I don’t have friend because all students in my school are stupid
1,"I really needed this video, thank you"
1,"The title, just after coming back from school.."
1,"I used to have tons of friends. As I get older I just want to be around other people less. I certainly require less validation from others, anymore I could care less what other people think. Sometimes I think maybe I'm not quite normal, in that I just don't want to be around other people. I'm ok with it when one of my friends call but I never call anyone. My friends call less and less often these days."
1,"I don’t speak the language of the country I’m in for a year, so I’m screwed and can’t even see people irl. I’m limited to online friends, and that’s why I have none. Miserable."
1,somehow this came at the right time lmao
1,"""Not saying a word makes others sympathetic towards you"" That is complete bull, due to zero confidence and zero self esteem I was practically a mute at school and everyone bullied me for it or when I gained some confidence some asshole was always there to pull the rug from under my feet. I was the lowest of the low in the social pecking order that even the geeks picked on me. God I hate children, evil little shits."

1,Let’s see how many new people and friends can get and open up even in this comment section. Drop your insta and I’ll talk :)
1,Social media is growing and so is loneliness.
1,Right in time for Highschool.
1,"Making friends is just hard when you start from 0. The energy you have to invest to make and keep them at the start is much higher than when you already have a social life. Because at the start, you're the one inviting ppl, but if you have a social circle, that means you have other ppl to invite you to things too. I've been stuck on this hole ever since the pandemic, and I know it gets easier, I just gotta reach that level first. After a while your social life becomes almost automated, and it's convenient for everyone"
1,Mmm... No. That's not how it works. You're so naive...

1,"Before the pandemic, I think I might’ve been one of the worst friends. I hardly cared for those who I thought of as friends, and hated those who did very little against me. The pandemic and online school then just about toppled over that old social behavior, and now that I’m back in in-person school, I’m trying so hard to improve how I treat others. I’m forgiving my real and fake enemies, and reaching out to my old friends. In the process, I ended up finding friends I lost long before the pandemic, so I guess I’m doing something right if it’s going better than it was before!
Thanks for the friendship advice. I’ll try to apply it."

2,Me who has no friends thanks for the video
1,Im lonely lost all my friends becuase of the lock down i havent talk to any of them in 3 years and i dont know how to make new ones but due to face to face classes so i have a shot of getting new ones or rebuilding my firendships with my old ones but i really dont know how to do it
1,"For me, it's my hearing disability. Really, I just use that as an excuse for being introverted and afraid of talking to people. 38 years old, single with 1 friend and his wife. I love my cat and when he dies so do I."
1,"Want to make more friends and be less depressed? Don't live in the suburbs.

Living in rural places can be an issue but at least going out is cheaper in that case and your bonds can be tight knit.
Living in the city makes it costly to go out and you end up being more ""replaceable"" but at least everything is in walking distance and there are plenty of people to meet that you'll probably find the right people.

Suburbs combine the worst elements of the two. Going out ends up costly and inconvenient. People are spread out but have plenty of meaningless acquaintances to shuffle between and rarely deeply connect."
1,"'My biggest issue is just the reciprocation. I try so hard - im constantly the person who reaches out/texts first, who tries to set something up if its been too long.. but everyone is just so busy with their own lives that as soon as i stop ""watering the plant"" it dies almost immediately, and it sucks when friendships feel like a one way street. Sometimes i feel like if i died tomorrow, nobody would notice for weeks."
1,Gotta love the cultural easter eggs throughout this video.  Well-played!
1,"Yeah, as a teen, COVID definitely screwed up my life. I had a pretty good social circle before. Then it hit, and I lost touch with all but one of my friends. That one friend now lives in another state, too, so I'm slowly loosing touch of that relationship. Not to mention, I moved to a new school and had to start all over again. Like the video mentioned, I have a literally unreasonable amount of acquaintance but the school is so big that my schedules barely overlap with anyone! I've tried 6 or so different clubs/activities and still can't seem to make genuine friends. Glad I'm not the only one, lol. Maybe I'll try some of these things. Although at this point, I've kind of given up..."
2,"LOL, who needs friends? I'm doing perfectly fine without any."
2,I have a friend that nobody love/likes so I’m his friend to confert him
1,Im going to school and 5th grade still no friends  :(
1,"As an introvert, I sometimes find the idea of making many casual friends repulsive because I really want to have genuine connections. Maybe that seems a bit condescending, but I always believed friends should be more than playing games and having parties."
1,"As a briggs myers personality type of INTJ I find it very easy to traverse life with the smallest group of friends. I appreciate this is huge for many people in the world, I feel blessed that my own brain oftentimes provides the best company."
1,"It feels like even tho there are people who have things in common with me, i have an immediate feeling that they find me annoying or just don’t put as much of effort as i do in a friendship, people keep forgetting about or completely ignoring me which i cant seem to avoid, idk wt to do at this point."

1,The person here is the same from the loneliness video
1,"As always Kurzgesagt is amazing at talking about things that seemed banal but actually are not.

These are suggestions that probably won't work for anyone, but the deepness and the ability to explain this easily helps lots of people feel included and a bit less lonely in this world.

Probably this video won't be a solution for everyone, but I still hope it can improve your life with a tiny piece of positivity. Don't give up!

In conclusion, thanks Kurzgesagt for your precious work red_heart"
1,"The same thing happened to me at the time of Offline classes. Now that my university has been conducting Offline classes, my social group has been increased by 10 time ,we go to movies and stuff ,clubs and a lot , this was one of my most relatable vudeo till now"
1,"I love these tips. The volunteering part, though, is one I am becoming more careful about. If you put way too much of yourself into it, like I did for many years, you may find people who only approach you when they need something, or to ask for your help with whatever project they're thinking of next. Sure, it's amazing to help others and to do your best to make the world a better place; I still intend to engage in activities such as those. However, you may just find some opportunistic people disguised as ""friends"" along the way, so it's crucial to pay attention to when and why people are generally nice to you."

1,"I'll be honest, I never saw the purpose or felt the need to develop any kind of relationship. I'm more than content with just relaxing at my own pace in my own little world; reading, playing games, seeing technology and science advance, and watching nature. I really only get upset about it when people keep trying to 'help' me by telling me how that's not 'normal' and suggesting that I should make friends.

My complete lack of friends has never resulted in me feeling sad or lonely. In fact, it instead brings me joy and tranquility. Trying to manage such a relationship sounds tiresome."

1,"Bah. Dang it. This is a very well made and informative video, but it doesn't really tell me anything I didn't already know. I'm always friendly. I genuinely enjoy being a reliable person. Even in confrontational situations I can be calm and reasonable. People tend to like me, but it seems like no one I want to be friends with wants to be friends. I live in the midwest, and finding people who even share my interests is hard enough, but when I do they tend to be not-great people. Even online, if I make a friend in a game, it's usually less than a week later and we're not playing games together or talking anymore.

I'm currently in a single, tightly-knit group of friends I made in school 15+ years ago. There's six of us, and I am easily the central connecting point in our group. The problem is that three of them are just generally awful people, and the other two aren't all that interested in my group of friends and spend much, much more time with their other friends. The only alternative seems to be to have no friends, and I've been there before. I refuse to go back. Even if it means putting up with depressing, and unreliable people."

So on the flip side, if you have a shy friend who rarely initiates anything but always shows up when you invite them, that must be frustrating but please don't be quick to cut them out of your life!"

1,"I did have a friend once but in highschool they just stopped talking to me and replaced me with another person they find funnier, then i realized how lonely I was without friends especially when people around you hang out with eachother and talk abt things you dont understand. Not understanding or relating to things other people are talking about is the worst feeling for me bc it feels like im missing out then ill try to fit in because if I dont, ill continue being lonely. I have to pretend to like something they like and do things they do because I DONT WANT TO BE LONELY.

For people who are experiencing the same thing, please dont try so hard and pretend to like something they like because you want to fit in. Be yourself and be kind to people, you will find someone who will atleast understand you eventually. red_heart"

1,"Dear young kids. When adults tell you "" there is plenty of time for that, after you finish your work "", they are lying. Finishing your work earns you more work. The time you spent doing the work is time you didn't have to socialise. There is a reason that, to use an old insult, ""Nerds"" are smart but have no friends, they did the work, ended up rejected from society. If they manage to get rich ( or had rich parents, eg founder of microsoft, facebook, amazon fall under rich parents ) then they can ""buy"" friends but, umm, are they real friends. Otherwise end up burnt out with others taking the credit.
Meanwhile the ""jocks"" who have shown a complete lack of smarts, have the friends and know how to overpower the nerds,( not necessarily obvious violence ), take the credit."

1,"I became hyper-independent during my first two years of college after my mental health spiraled upon graduating high school. I was happy that the pandemic gave me the solo time I loved during my times of feeling like “I got nobody but myself” kind of vibe due to my mental health. When it was time to get back to on-campus classes as the pandemic slowly died down, my POV of life and mindset began to heal and everything became very optimistic for me :) Just when I was ready to put myself out there because of my new profound life in me again, I didn’t realize how my social skills with forming friends really needed some work smiling_face_with_tear

Mind you, I was very social and out there before my mental health struggle so I thought, since I’m feeling better and newer than I did before I can just go back to how I used to with making friends face_with_tears_of_joy But ugh didn’t realize my mental health decline decreased my friends from high school and voided me of connections in general. During those times, I’m glad to say I’ve managed to form some close friends I can really rely on that I’ve made but was sad to realize the connections I’ve severed. 

Long story short, I’ve reached out to my old friends and asked if they wanted to catch up and hang out :-)) Been going to occasional parties and newly into clubbing with new friends. I just wanted to say, for those struggling with mental health and feeling like there’s no way for you to connect with your former friends again, know that you definitely can :) Took me a lot of strength and courage as I started to feel better about myself"
1,"This should be the most viewed channel on YouTube. Thanks for all you do, Kurzgesagt!"
1,this channel knows its audience well
1,"In my experience finding a 'friend' to spend time with is easy, , but finding someone that won't dump you when you actually need support is probably more rare than winning the super ball lottery.

Humans are inherently selfish creatures.  A large portion of 'good' people only do what is seen as a selfless act for the very selfish reason of 'it makes them feel good',  and you know what?   That's okay."
1,YouTube algorithm needs to chill tf out
1, bro i dont know why the dancing animation made me bust out laughing like a maniac

I want Nick Fury to be my friend! grinning_squinting_face"

0,“Why you’re lonely and how to make friends” holy shit when did you guys bribe my FBI agent for my search history
1,"People who are too disabled to go out, and/or too vulnerable to Corona exposure for going out, or seeign people face to face to be safe, who don't have school or work could also use a way to actually make friends, locally and otherwise. It's hard to even find good online spaces geared towards getting to know people more causally that aren't focused around having a shared interest already (such as fandom specific discord servers) least of all that let you filter for rough age group and rough location without making that information public or having to provide it. I want to be chatting with people who I know are my peers and roughly in the same stage of life as me, who I might have the chance to meet up with some day, not end up ALWAYS conversing with people who aren't my peers or live across the world from me just because we are into the same TV show and have nothing else in common. They're plenty nice people but it doesn't make for ideal or appropriate long term close friends with people who can actually function as some kind of support structure. We have the technology to do this better, I know we do.

IF virus levels are ever under control enough that I can safely breathe the same air as other people again, I want to be able to see my friends face to face, but any app used to meet people locally ends up becoming about dating and hookups, and most apps don't function the way something like whisper does where your location isn't shown or shared at all, but merely used to show you who's close by. Some of us have stalkers or have been stalked before and it isn't safe for us to have even our general location out there, but we still might want to be matched with people who are already local to us, for something that is actually for super real just a friendship, and with people who won't bail the moment they realize they aren't getting sex or drugs out of it.

A free app with prioritized privacy, a location optional service that doesn't show you to anyone who isn't already close by (very important) but DOES NOT show your location to anyone, or that you even HAVE a profile to people who aren't in range, that has basic information you can fill out about your general leanings and interests that is VERY EXPLICITLY NOT for hooking up, with social or group chat options, would be very helpful. Every app I have tried that CLAIMS to be about finding friends asks for very physical information and otherwise is clearly meant for dating, or I get zero activity and zero matches because I'm not DTF and that's what people are there for. Many of these apps are hostile to not using a profile picture or one that obscures you from possibly being recognized by the wrong person or by software, and for anyone with security and safety concerns this basically means you can't even get your profile approved without fully using someone else's photo. Many want you to use your legal name and provide a phone number, which is also hostile to people with concerns like mine. 

Facebook and most other social media don't cut it, whisper doesn't cut it, we3 or whatever it's called doesn't cut it. None of these apps take the disabled, the asexual, the only actually wanting friends, or the vulnerable into consideration. Most of them are hostile to humanity in general. Even Acebook is about wanting to meet other asexuals to PARTNER with. Some of us can't leave our houses and still need to make friends and find support structures to be a part of. Some of us have had our existing connections decimated by abusive relationships, do not have work or school and are estranged from their family, and we need options that are SAFE too.

Face to face meetups are great for most people, if perhaps poorly timed considering the pandemic, but for some of us that's just not safe or possible. People like me just spent the whole pandemic being told we are disposable and being left out of solutions, even being left out of relief and policies meant to help because we don't have kids or partners, and we also need ways to form new relationships that take special needs and accessibility into account and don't make us even more vulnerable in various ways than we already are."
1,Question: what if you just struggle with having a decent conversation? Seems kinda hard to make friends if you can't do that
2,"To be honest, as a psychologist, I cannot be more in agreement with this video
It's literally perfect. it explains things really easy and well
I really enjoy your videos, and this one for example shares a really good concept and idea. Keep it up =)"
1,"If a friend stop being your friend simply because you didn’t ask about them, regardless whether you are busy or not then put it that’s way, they don’t deserve to be your friend a true friend will understand.
Btw if a hard time needed someone and that’s one just run away without valid reason he too doesn’t deserve to be a friend"
1,"This needs to be a meme, like really the title was meme possibility"
1,"I deleted my Instagram and facebook because I think no one will contact me. In couple of week,when I browsing those social media,I always feel envious and jealous when I see some people are posted their colorful life.
I remember that there is a video about loneliness few years ago, and the video mentioned that social pain is the human's own protection mechanism to prevent us from doing things that make others ostracize us. 
I usually feel myself is full of social pain, but 
I don't know how to do."
1,third
1,Social interaction isn't enough.  To jot feel.ljnely you need at least one close friend and also a sexual partner.  These are basically never going to happen for many people.
2,friend?? Whats that?
1," Ok, this is my favorite part of the video. Just the quick comment about the confusion was perfect"
2,"When I help my friends I’m met with thanks , when I need help I’m just forgotten cause my friends don’t care"
1,Damn Kurzgesagt really calling me out.
1,how the fuck do you know tha... wait this might be useful nevermind
0,How the fuck did you know
1,"Can you guys go back to making videos about how the universe is vast and empty and dangerous and everything will eventually end?
I think I preferred those."
1,Oh boy another amazing video with good advice on how to not want to kms that I will ignore :)
1,"Kurzgesagt, I will listen to you about any scientific, social or historic knowledge you have to teach with absolute trust.
But do not tell me to make more friends, I will not betray the few I have now.
I do not want more nor am socially capable of staying close with a larger number."
1,"Often I feel crushungly lonely, but if I try to hang out with people it's often more annoying and boring than fulfilling. The last time my roommates wanted to cook together I spent 2 extra hours at work just so I could shorten the time I had to spend with them. And even that felt like a waste of time.
Maybe I just haven't met someone I actually connect with. I feel like an alien next to most people, like we don't even speak the same language."
1,"I had a huge fight with some friends. Honestly thought the whole thing was over, years of lifelong friendship and experiences gone in just a few short hours and 2 days later I’m in the gym spotting my best friend for life as he’s doing his max. Idk if I’m in a toxic relationship or if guys truly forgive very quickly, but either way I wouldn’t trade it for the world"
1,"Great with perfect animation as always, I have seen every video from you and there was zero videos I don't like. This is one of the best channel on youtube so far."
0,I don't have any friends. And i have social anxiety. This sucks
0,2.6M lonely souls
1,"I am lonely because I choose loneliness over the burdens of social interactions. I have had 32 years to weigh out the pros and cons and realized what I truly care about. After going through major issues in my past, I've cut every one out of my life and I can honestly say I've never been happier. The past 2 years of my life has been utter bliss"
1,but i dont go to shcool
1,this video made me cry
1,"just one question, how do you create those animation? I wanna learn"
2,I love this channel. It's like they read my mind before posting a video.grinning_facesmiling_face_with_heart-eyes
1,"Been described as ""chronically lonely"" before. It can be difficult to make friends as an adult. The rough ballpark estimate was that I've been chronically lonely since 2007. You get used to it."
1,I remember when Kurzgesagt uploaded informational videos rather than PSAs.
1,"real friends cost money and time. there are cheaper ways to be happy than making real friends.   its 2022 not 1922 ,as long as you are happy. the lonely sickness study doesnt apply to you."
1,"I would love to make some friends as i only currently have one friend i see every now and then and a few past friends i write with rarely. My biggest issue is the fact that i never know what to say. I dont know what to ask about or what to answer when people talk to me. I used to be very extroverted and had millions of friends as a kid but was abused by my father when i said something he didnt like at home or i sang in my room or really did anything except just being quiet. I also got bullied in school. This resulted in me just shutting down in all conversations. I either dont know what to say at all or i overshare. I have this really bad impulsive thought in my head that no one likes me because why should they, nothing i have to say has any worth…"
1,wtf with all these close to home hitting videos kurzgesagt
1,"Thank you so much for this, hits too hard loudly_crying_face"
1,"i feel so lame trying to look for new friends when i'm almost 30, but i'm going to get over it and do it face_with_steam_from_nose"
1,I can't imagine just reaching out to people to keep in touch. I feel like it's rude to interrupt and also feel like people are just waiting for me to leave them alone
1,"I feel like Kurzgesagt is like God’s YouTube channel which is totally stupid and I’m not particularly a believer, but… whenever I’m having issues a video conveniently comes out relative to the topic same day."

1,"You're making a video about how to make friends easier. Ever stop to think why it's hard in the first place?

Despite what people want to believe, humans are not social animals. We do much better being alone. Less stress."
1,or make sure you don’t date nobody else when they literally talk to the whole world
1,"Damn, I didn’t expect to get therapy from YouTube"
1,"I don't only think the videos are awesome but how it bring out the willingness to share experiences, drama and most importantly feelings from so many different people, places and perspectives. I never really thought about how I, personally, have affected so many of my relationships with friends and family. never have I thought about the facts that there are always, at least, two parties involved in every relationship and have always seen myself as a victim of poor judgment or timing. I see that my actions may have done the same to others that I though were only happening to me. Makes me want to tell everyone I know I love them. I hope everyone has a wonderful day."
1,Gotta say. Just in time
2,Thank you so much I’m a very shy person and I have a social problem Thank you These tips will help
1,"well also doesn't help moving to a new city to the other side of the world as an adult, some years passed and still no friends, just colleagues or acquaintances"
1,"And what else I liked about this video. Sharing from my experience. I'm finishing maritime college right now. I spent almost a year on a ship as a deck cadet with randomly selected people for crew. After about 10 months I felt the difference between the ""working pal's"" and friends. I had a very nice crew onboard, we spent a lot of free time together (watching movies, karaoke, grilling, drinking, playing etc.). But still, for me I felt these are only temporary nice people I met there. Because I only knew them 1) because they were ship crew 2) because i had to share every day with them. I don't say I didn't like them but I could tell a difference between them and my friends from country."
2,"Kurzgesagt, will you be my friend? grinning_face_with_big_eyes"
1,"I’ve tried this stuff to gain friends, the problem is that no one I’ve tried to interact with wants to do anything so instead I’m left with plans that never follow through because people are so lazy"
1,Thinking you need a lot of friends is a bad way to live life.  Having a few positive relationships is better than many shallow ones.
1,"I think expectation is the friendship killer. Let’s say that I want to revive one of my old friendships that I remembered and cared. If I initiate the conversation now, it will be most likely fine. I can do it again some time later. But then even if I wanted, I would probably wait that person to initiate because I would think the other person isn’t really interested that much. Especially when I got older, I realized this is what is happening to my old friendships. Even if I don’t necessarily want to lose them, they fade away sometimes."
1,Those people watching this and crying rn:
1,But I’m a misanthrope I see humanity for what it really is got a video for that ?
1,"I just want to say that i have so many things to comment here but i can't just open up to anyone, even myself. I believe that there will be a time where i am talking to someone not for the sake of entertainment and company. But what would my younger self feel if the present me is still believing? I just need that one phrase that could turn my whole life around. I'm confidently scared to face the reality that the problem lies only within me. I'm deeply sorry to myself that i can only move forward putting the brave mask that i know nothing of."
0,the title is attacking people
0,Wtf are friends? A new pokemon?!
1,"I always try to thank people for inviting me out, especially when I can't hang out or make it to events. I try to ensure that I thank them in a way that keeps them approaching me to hang out because I often feel that people can get the wrong idea that just because I couldn't hang out that one time that they shouldn't spend energy trying to hang out with me again."
2,Thank you very much for uploading this.. this will really help me out
1,For me it’s the difference between being lonely and alone. I have to problem finding friends but it’s the real connection part and actually wanting to spend time with them that’s the problem
1,"Just moved to a new city for studies, joined classes late so friend groups were already formed. But a week later I also feel like part of the group."
1,"This is great and all, but I don't understand with all these facts and stuff why I feel so much better being at home by myself than literally with anyone..."
1,Its kind of crazy how much the internet has changed us
0,Didn't have to call me out like that
2,Hi Kurzgesagt!!! Thanks for sharing all your knowledge and spread love  into the world to make it better!!! It helps too much!!!!Thanks Youu!!!
2,Before the pandemic i already do not have friends XD
1,"What do you mean how to get friends , are you trying to say something?,
 kinda sus."
1,Just the sign I was waiting for. It was hard making new friends ever since the pandemic struck. I am struggling now with making new friends in the new environment. This was never the case before the pandemic. This video is an excellent reminder that life is much better with friends. So I think its time to see the world again! Thanks Kurzgesagt
0,One of the worst things you can experience is when someone just loses interest in you for no reason.

1,Wait a minute. Why is this on my recommended section?
1,"The toughest part throughout my whole life when it comes to finding friends is that most people I meet are only interested in themselves, so the conversations and activities get boring after a while. Or people’s personalities are too extreme. Either they’re really boring, quiet, and don’t want to do anything, or they’re so active, that the only way to be friends with them is jump out of planes or ski the Grand Couloir. It seems really tough to find balanced people"
1,"Dont need many friends, got my best friend, got my gf, im good, just another manipulative video trying to make people believe this is how humans must live."
1,"""The biggest illusion of all, is the illusion of separation''"
1,"“Sometimes, the only friend you need, is someone that has been by your side all along”"
1,"I found this video interesting because most advises are the ones that I normally give to people that tell that they have difficulty socializing. I usually don't talk about hosting events (but I totally agree).
I learned some rules about socializing, some years ago when I worked a real estate agent (Chose that job to improve my social skills).
Nowadays I don't have many friends because my career takes me all the time and I am ok with it, but it's good to know that I know the formula (although it requires practice to improve)"
2,Great! So if you're an introvert that prefers solitary activities you have no chance what so ever of gaining friends in adulthood.

That is crazy what for a Domino-effect is happening."
2," Since you’re more likely to be friends with someone with more friends than fewer friends.

1,What is the YouTube algorithm trying to tell me here?
1,"I happen to be one of those people who has a lot of real life (non-social media) friends. I think it's because I'm just so likable (this is not me having a massive ego, people have genuinely told me I'm very chill and  easy to get along with). But sometimes this can be a double edged sword where I'll find myself spectating some friend drama where one doesn't agree with the other, or maybe people will talk behind each other's backs. And I try to be very neutral when it comes to these types of dramas, but then I start to watch friends drift apart and it just sucks."
1,But friends bring pleasure and pleasure is the work of slaanesh
1,"The amount of initiatives happening all over the world in such a short period of time based on this video is insane! Today there was a small meet-up in Utrecht, the Netherlands, and was great!! More are already planned! I really can't overstate what this video has already done in making new connections"
1,"The Best video I would watch in such time, when I got lost, alone and basically empty? Thank you Kurzgesagt for making this video!"
2,"""Recommend for you"""
1,"@Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell   How come you guys don't put a Table of Contents / Indexes as standard for all of your videos??  
I just about always just scroll to whomever has put up the index, because while these videos are very informative and useful, they are also quite triggering for me (and I assume plenty of others watching these videos!!!) and I would rather see what the points are to see if its relevant, before watching the whole thing. 
I do realise that it probably affects the view count or something..."
2,This wouldve saved me 2 months ago.

2,"I like being alone bro, friends come and go"
1,"This channel a year ago: lets talk about the mysteries of the universe

This channel now: PLEASE GO OUT AND SOCIALIZE THE DAMAGE TO OUR SOCIETY IS IRREPARABLE"
1,"In hindsight, I don't know that I've ever had a true friend.  I've had hundreds of acquaintances and known thousands of people - Some of whom I hung out with all the time.  Some who I've known for decades.  When I look around, I don't see many people who have real friends.  People label others as such all the time.  The majority of people are there only when you have something to offer them.  It's depressing.  

I've also found that the older you get, the more difficult it is to meet people - Outside of potential relationships.  People even just a few years younger than me have it worse.  It seems most people have lost social skills, in large part due to the advent of social media.  I've also, later in life, had several epiphanies about family members and people I've known a long time.  I realized that most of them weren't my friends.  Not only that, but that they're toxic.  I'd gone through life ignoring the poor behavior of others.  This was a terrible and deep cut.

Anyhoo.  I know there are people out there who have friendships.  It bothers me that I've not, to my knowledge, had that."
1,I found before the pandemic I had so many friends but after it took a toll on me and I became more and more inclosed. I'm 19 now and I still feel this way. Still this is a very helpful video and I might get back on that horse and try again because of it
1,"Thank you, this video is truly beautiful red_heart"
1,I’m lonely cuz my classmates made a mistake and now they think I’m dirty I can’t even get close to them but I think this can help me too? I just ate a yellow candy during class and it’s Covid I was with a mask on I don’t know when I got some on my hair but I don’t know how my classmates think that some sticky could be ear wax
1,This video is calling me out and I don't like it
1,"You forgot the most important thing. Most people are useless and don't show any worth in their whole lifes, so being friends with them is useless"
1,What is this video?
1,"if you lack hobbies it's infinitely harder. ""go do things you enjoy without expectation of friendships"" but i don't HAVE things that i enjoy doing, not in person at least. it's so hard to even just find things i myself like, let alone things other people would like with me."
1,Almost firsg
1,"Who the hell needs friends when everyone wants to be your enemy? Tell me about it. Go on, tell me how wrong I am!?




I moved countries.  People, I found, are the same everywhere. They're not friendlier where I currently live. They're all the same. Everyone wants something.  

I. Don't.  Need. Friends.
But thanks for the video, it may help others. Not me though."
1,Bro these YouTube recommendations are starting to get too accurate loudly_crying_face
1,"I'm 44 and all friends I ever had betrayed me, stole from me or abused me somehow. I'm ""friendless"" for about 2.5 year now and I'm talking about literally not a single person I would call a friend. No one has visited my house in 2 years, during lockdown no-one ever messaged me even to joke about lockdowns. Not even talking about checking if I'm breathing. There is not a single person who would remember my date of birth, so the last time I got a birthday card was 2019, from work. 
Price of this loneliness is terrible. I have no one to watch movies with or discuss what I recently watched and liked. No birthdays, no barbecues, no coffee at Starbucks. Nothing. Just inner silence that screams every time I see other people together. But I'm done with people who can't understand the concept of friendship, togetherness, loyalty or human decency. I don't t know what's worse, being abandoned or being alone."
1,This is the only channel on Youtube that i'd watch 1 hour straight without clicking out of it's videos.
2,Will you be my friend?
1," I don't agree with how that was worded. Introverts yearn connection just as much as anyone else; they simply find their energy zapped after social life.
You can love a sport which exhausts you just as an introvert can yearn social interaction that will exhaust them."
1,"After high school I find myself never feeling like anyone new I come across is a friend, they all feel like temporary acquaintances. The initial friendliness is easy for me, but it feels like nobody sticks around unless it's romance related. 

All my current friends are from grade school, and they've been dwindling a lot... I'm afraid all my friends will be gone soon."
1,"I have Aspergers.  Thank you for explaining things like this logically.  If I weren’t deployed, I’d  be going to a meetup."
1,YouTube really said recommended for YOU
2,"Yall are like, bettering the world"
1,Just came here after a breakup. This really helped.
2,"I have BPD, so yeah,.. no friends,.. :("
1,"As someone whose an expat I truly do understand the difficulty of making new friends especially as an adult. It doesn't help that the majority of people where I currently live have lifelong friendships (20+ years in most cases) So the general consensus from the people who live here tends to be ""I already have plenty of friends so why would I want to meet new people""?  Which for someone like me, coming from a country where you could make a new friend just from a trip to your local grocer, it tends to be incredibly off putting because you can meet someone( people)  that you have a lot in common with and you guys really hit it off but then whenever you inquire about perhaps a follow up engagement..........You can just smell the apprehension coming from their body!!!!  And the side effects from the constant rejection can get a bit overwhelming so for quite a while I just gave up on trying to meet new people."
1,"I'm not sure why but it's become quite the opposite. The less I communicate with people the better I feel. There have been months in which I elected to not even pick up calls or answer texts and the longer I live - the less need I have of other people. All they really associate with is anger and hatred and not ""a sense of purpose"" or ""meaning"". Humans are dimwitted, callous and frequently lacking a morsel of empathy, they are the worst of the Hominidae, and the sooner they go extinct, - the better for all other species of animals, plants and fungi on this planet. As for me, - I'm ready to die in my sleep the very coming night."
0,I feel personally attacked by this video!
2, SETTLERS OF CATAN!! love that game
1,"This sound like it ignores the unique struggles of neurodivergent or minorities in general which are also the most likely to be isolated.
Like, that part about school being easier to make friends. What if you're that person that struggles to make friends and gets bulliied by everyone at school? Just being there with people will certainly not help. Or when you're expected to hide essential parts of yourself to be tolerated."
1,"""spend time with people in real life"" theres a lot of friendships that started and only exist online. it is a lot easier to forgot someone exists when they are just text on a screen or someone in a voice chat. i was in a long distance relationship with a girl when i was in high school. we talked every day for 3 years...... she doesnt even remember who i am. almost 1100 days of our lives spent talking to each other and theres not even a hint of memory of me.... so i dunno yea"
1,"funny you only talked about TikTok, before TikTok, youtube was the biggest time-spending platform, yes? didn't see this video 3 years ago. lol !"
1,"I think the entire point of this video is severely hindered for certain groups in particular: as an example among many, individuals with high-functioning autism (or any disorder within the spectrum, really) tend to avoid social relationships either by nature or out of omnipresent fear for rejection, judgement, betrayal, and generally every instrument the tyrannical 98% of humans (a.k.a. neurotypicals) put to good use in excluding those with additional strain or difficulties in terms of social skills, no matter their inherent value as a person. A point could be made that taking minorities into account is pointless, but that's just a poor, low-effort ad populum fallacy."
1,Friends are over rated... People that are so needy that they need friends are sheep... Become your own person immerse yourself into hobbies and projects...
1,Watching this video in my college dormitory room completely alone hits really hard...
2,Great to wake up and see kurzgesagat making a tutorial on making friends. From life threading bacteria to how to make friends. (Still loneliness is not good and everyone deserves a friend.
1,"Just about yesterday I was writing on an online journal about being lonely for years and having this feeling about ""being in a group but never actually be a part of them and often being the forgotten one"". Man I'm so tired of that feeling."
2,"In the last couple of months nobody used to talked to me in school unless it was a useful work even my best friends were ignoring me I felt like I was left alone ,everyone in my class had friends and there was me just sitting in a corner listing to them and  getting bullied by others ,I was depressed and now I was just wondering how lonely I am and had 0 friends who I can trust but this video popped up I hope it will help me make new friends. I was following you for a long time @Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell thanks for making a video on this topic I hope everyone in this world gets a friend who can trust each others and call themselves as real a friends"
1,"This hit right in the perfect place in my life right now.  Thank you for sharing Kurzgesagt, it was beautiful. Appreciate all your hard work! <3"
1,"I have found i am not connected with the person but rather the activity we are doing. Like i am a friend for more people then they are friends for me; Which i think is kind of what you already said in your video. If we are doing an activity that i enjoy, they could literally be replaced with anyone else and i wouldn't bat an eye as long as we are still doing the ""fun thing"". 
That is what i have found makes things harder for me. I also don't like the company or behaviour of many people with their misinformation, illogical thinking, and overreliance on emotion. That makes me the weird one of my species, i get that."
1,"Kurzgesagt literally the previous video: *The World might End*
Also Kurzgesagt the next video: How to make Friends :)"
1,"One thing I will point out is the whole social distancing thing temporarily hit everyone and caused problems, but for this autistic kid that’s my entire life. In fact I was very happy during the lockdowns as everyone suddenly was like me, the masks hid a lot of nonverbal communication people take for granted, I have a hard time keeping eye contact so suddenly we’re on the same level as one example. No I don’t wish any of the Covid things to happen but for once I could interact with people and everyone was like me, it was nice while it lasted"
1,"“Okay, i get it, i understand. theres people here to hold my hand. But what happens when, happens when, i cant, comprehend someone holding my hand”"
1,"...and that's basically it.

Sounds terrible rolling_on_the_floor_laughing"
1,I’ve been called out here
1,"Get your ass off social media. There I saved you 13 minutes of your life...

Want more advice?
1. Stop eating like shit
2. Go to the gym and improve your health
3. Stop playing video games and go outside (Beaches, Parks, Bars, Restaurants, etc.)
4. Improve your mental health by getting out of anxiety ridden relationships
5. Change your dog sh!t profession and go to trade school/apprenticeship

You're welcome."
2,I have no friends at all lol
1," Ayyyyy, Parliament is dope!"
1,I feel heard face_holding_back_tearsheart_hands
2,Boardgames are so great to make friends :)
2,"I have a few friends but I almost never see them. I guess I would consider my board game groups friends too, but we never ever hang out unless playing. Thankfully I enjoyed time to myself too."
1,Mark Zuckerberg should watch this... real world friends with physical interaction is better than the virtual ones (metaverse)
1,"I made no friends at school. I made few friends following school. Though few, my friends would walk through fire for me, and I for them.

I never feel lonely alone. I never feel more lonely than when I am surrounded by people. The bigger the crowd, the more painful the experience.

I was in my thirties when I realised I was on the spectrum. It explained a lot."
1,This hits home. I’ve never felt this conflicted while watching a video. Incredible as always.
1,Okay you didn't have to call me out like that Kurzgesagt :_(
1,"Every time Kurzgesagt uploads a video, either my existential crisis or insecurity gets attacked"
2,didn't expect to be attacked like this today XD
1, that is impossible for me
1,"""this is why it's so easy to form new friendships in schools and universities"" it's so what???"
0,Did I miss the intro???
1,"Dang, kurzgesagt really be calling us all out"
1,"Even after a lot of personal stuff going on between me and some former friends, I still would love to be their friend again and I know if they came knocking, I’d accept it even after everything that transpired. 

Occasionally, I feel like trying to reach out, since it’s been a few months or even years for some, but deep down I’m too afraid of rejection especially after I have recovered and mentally improved a lot recently. I’m too afraid to throw it all away when I’m either gonna be given a cold No, a laugh or just no response all together. 

I’m sure many can relate. 

But by the off chance, someone does see this comment and recognises me, if you wanna talk, we can."
1,hearing kurzgesagt say vibe was a life-changing moment
1,"One thing that I wish had been touched on is virtual friends.  I've had really good online friends from different parts of the world that I've never met but that I talk to almost daily and know all about them, and them about me.  My parents are a bit old-school and insist that it's not the same as having real life friends, and while in some respects I do agree, I still find the emotional wellbeing part of friendship is absolutely satisfied with online friends.  I would love to see some research on the topic."
1,"In modern society, it is fact that making friends is harder than before because of several reasons as shown in the video, but conversely, we also have more opportunities to make friends than before. There are several apps and communities which can share our interests easily if you want to make new relationship. Then just go out of your bubble and try to make new buddies !!"
2,"I'm not lonely, and do not wish to make friends."
1,"""Why You Are Lonely""

Don't gotta call me out like that"
2,I accepted not having friends. Being a piece of shit is much more fulfilling.
1,"I always was a ""proxy"" as a kid.

Here's how that works. 
Someone becomes a friend with you.
You introduce them to your other friend.
The other 2 friends become friends and leave you out of the picture.

This is just how it was.
So I always believe that everyone I meet is trying to be a proxy, and not actually being a friend with me, which makes it
 quite hard to keep/make friends."
1,You never know who you’re going to meet in life. Just be open-minded and let people into your heart. It’s not always about romance. It’s about people and the energy they have and how you just never know!
1,"Meh I'd rather just stay lonely, as it's best to trust no one but yourself. So-called friends will just stab you in the back sooner or later. As far as a shorter life, who cares, everyone is gonna die sooner or later anyway. That's one of the many things that suck about being human."
2,"well, im not planning to waste my 20's so im looking for new friends people
i love to laugh and to make people laugh even more
i love video games, anime, sports.
mainly i hate staying at home, and if i get new friends its always being a long distance friendship."
1,"My advice is to start thinking of anything you find interesting if you are alone or have literally nothing to do.
Maybe even start a dialogue with youself."
1,"For Christ's sake, grow up and learn to enjoy the peace of being alone. You can still have friends without being so goddamned needy all the time."
2,"Don’t worry too much.  If you think about it, most of your friends are jerks"
1,"And sorry, romance is bullshit, so this vid is talking nonsense"
1,"You completely ignore the fact that a huge percentage of the population that are simply less compatible for any available friendships, for various reasons. You also ignore the fact that a significant percentage of the population is made up of terrible people who will rob, abuse, mistreat, or kill you, and a larger percentage of the population who are insufferable assholes."
1,Pov:your father left to get milk
1,I just got this notification and I am feeling very called out right now
1,"Thank you so much this was an important video for me, my mental health isn't good due to loneliness and no friends. This video saved my life and I cant thank you enough. You are the best"
1,"I gotta tell you that friendships can take a lot of work, you have to deal with all their quarks and idiosyncracies.  I have friends and honestly I wonder if I was better off being alone."
2,Lol imagine having to watch a video to learn how to make friends
1,"this made me tear up, thanks for the push!"
1,"Great video. Never had any issues by getting friends but the most of them were just ""friends"", especially when I got older. They just talked about themselves when we met each other to have a good time. There wasn't a real interest in my life, not even in my hardest times. Many of them just called when they needed something from me and it did hurt the first times it happened and afterwards they often were gone. Is this friendship? Don't think so. I give and do everything for the people I love and I except it from the other side as well. So yeah, today I'm fine with not having a lot of friends and often being by myself. At least the people I have in my life are the people who do care about me and I care about them. That's all what matters to me."
2,"Easy solution: if you have no friends you’re probably weird enough to join a drama club, enjoy it. And get friends"
1,TikTok was created in China and is also banned in China. Consider the reason why that is
1,"Due to health issues and mental illness I had no friends in my early 20s, while trying to make sense of my inner and the outer world. This advice was roughly my approach! Took a lot of practise and accepting the failures but I got there and have a nice small group of close pals I'm very grateful of. 29y now."
1,"In 9th grade i made the decision to move a class and be in a new enviroment, this is untill today the hardest thing i have done in hindsight. i made this decision a couple of months before covid and it made it really hard to connect with the people of the class untill even now. I will continue to try and make these friendships genuine but in school its very hard, everyone has a set in friend group and in our last year of school its not going to be easy. wish me luck guys, i hope i get to feel like i felt with my older classmates at least a couple of times"
1,Are they start  making personal videos?
1,i relies friends are like pillars that support u but i feel like the woods to me is like a friend it gives me comfort and it helps me relax and think and it provides so much u understand life more when u look at the things around the wilderness u learn how these creatures live and its like medicine that lets u see things more fluidly and some ppl probably dont get what im saying but i just think ppl today are corrupted and confused so it kinda drives me away from ppl but ive found my cousin is a friend to me and if i could find ppl more like her i would probably have lots of friends but animals are like friend as well they teach you so much so all im saying is its hard for me to make friends is bc i view things differently
1,"Introverts can only be comfortable around their family and be their true selves, but they shell themselves out from 90% of new people/people they don't know. People should understand at some point, their so-called family might not be there for them anymore either through death/distance. From that point onwards no one would be there for them, it's as if they lost themselves/(true identity) just like a walking corpse suffering through the vines of life until their lonely demise..."
1,It's incredible how I never realised this was the problem. This is the greatest advice I've taken this year. Thank you very much!
1,"I hate how I see the ""friends"" I used to have post pictures of them together or celebrate their special days without even inviting or informing me... Especially for those things that they usually invite me yearly..."
0,"I appreciate the sentiment, but the truth is that I don't have many friends because I like hurting people."
1,"Ok! Not even started and I know that was for me... bad trip, here we go"
1,"I’m not gonna lie no matter how many friends I make in real life or online I always feel this emptiness and dissatisfaction from everything I do and when I find a new game I like the slight joy never lasts that long and I find myself extremely bored and can never find a way to fix it, but I’ve also developed insomnia, I’m no longer taking naps but I’m staying up all day and through the night along with having adhd, it doesn’t make my life much better, and no matter what I do with my friends they don’t seem to even pay attention to me I have 5 main friends that I talk to and I’m not even a third wheeler I’m a 6th wheeler and I have no hope for my life to get any better at this point"
1,Just let me be lonely and don't remind me of it

2,"Thanks YouTube for the recommendation, really needed it."
1,Hey this isn't a video about my drug addiction... CLICKBAIT! Lol jk don't do drugs kids
1,The level of detail you guys give to your animations are incredible.
0,"Not everyone wants to be social. And it's annoying as hell when everyone thinks more annoying people will make me less depressed.

I'm depressed because the shitty people. Why would I want to be around them?"
1,"I want more ""what if"" videos. and sci fi too. Pls dont lose your charm"
1,"damn bro this hurts more than the ""Please take a shower immediately"" from duolingo :("
1,"The fact that as of this very second, over 3 million people have watched this very same video tells me something..."
1,Love your videos and everything but can you guys focus more on “what if” scenarios like the space elevator face_with_tears_of_joy Those are so much cooler than the human mind
1,"I felt I got called out when I saw the title of this video, maybe I've got to do something about it"
1,"I swear, Kurzgesagt has a way of being there when I need it the most. I literally contemplated life and cried for 2 hours after finally realizing how I have no meaningful connections in college. I open YouTube and the first thing I see is this video, uploaded a few hours ago. Somehow I swear Kurzgesagt is calibrated with my life. Anyone else feel this way?"
1,You left out VR social games. Ive made a number of really good close friends there.
1,This video arrived at the most needed moment. Thank you Kurzgesagt.
1, the ancient friendship ritual of ”putting your gun on the table”.
1,Ihave a personel problem and this program is beneficial.
2,Lol why is this in my recommended? What are you tryna say YouTube?
1,"Man... Kurzgesagt is way too good for us. I appreciate this channel so much,"
1,When theres no one in your area to meet up with.. lmao
1,Loveee itttt asfSDG3H5FMS6Y3QNHDFAY O4M--AGL21
1,"""It's important to meet people you have things in common with, and are open to new relationships.""

I think this has been a hurdle for me. It's not too hard to find people I have things in common with. But the ""open to new relationships"" part is something outside of your control. You can meet a thousand people who are perfect friend matches for you (and you perfect for them), but if they aren't interested in expanding their social circle at that time, you're shit out of luck. 

And so a large chunk of making those connections is relegated to the realm of chance.

It's either that or you ""settle"" for the friends who are available to you. But that usually ends in the feeling of being ""lonely in a crowd"", when you start to realize that you have major moral/ethical/value differences that really just can't be resolved -- and so you feel unseen/unloved even though you have a large friend circle on paper."
1,"wait, did the title/thumbnail for this change?"
1,"""find someone with same world views"" yeah, ask Facebook, Twitter and the other social media giants whether your view is ""acceptable"" or not..."
1,Appreciate this + <3
2,"if you are reading this, you are enough and i hope you make a new friend tomorrow"
1,This is the first Kurzgesagt video I had to dislike because I cannot relate
2,"My best idea for making friends was working out, getting handsome, then building a harem lol. I still have faith in MPUAS thogrinning_face_with_sweat"
1,I recently sort of lost all my friends. They all went off to Uni. I had a mental breakdown and decided to skip a year to get my head in the game for Uni. A year later and my mind is still fucked. I also came out as trans properly and haven’t had the courage to tell my old friends. Thought it would be easier to not tell them and just make new friends who knew from the start. Turns out I was wrong. Haven’t made a new friend in a year and have just lost all my old ones. It sucks
2,I am ugly so I have no friends. Still living for now.
1,the way i had a breakdown at school today because of this reason… a little too “for you”
1,is it just me or the animations got more fluid?
1,"One thing he forgot to say is that you shouldn’t try to make people like you, they either do or they don’t. 

Just think of yourself as a vendor and your personality, interests and hobbies is on your table. 

If they dont like what you have to offer, move on to the next. 

You shouldn’t false advertise because then you wont be yourself"
1,Literally yesterday I was having a conversation with my online friend on how it's difficult to make friends in the real world. Then this pops up. This is a sign of new beginnings.
1,I recently separated myself from my group of friends and am essentially completely alone. This video being released is an incredible coincidence to me.
1,Now I am literally crying
2,My right hand is my best friend. My left hand is my lover.
1,I made 3 friends that common interest and vibes but I talk to one of them sometimes but I haven’t talked to the others for a year. Will it be weird if I take to them and ask them to hang out or not?
1,Why are you making videos about my life kinda creepy ngl
1,Please return to science education content. You were so good at it.
1,"this one made me cry a lil bit. I'm good for social stuff personally, but the necessity of this video broke me a lil. Your team are saints and I love you"
0,Damn pretty direct

1,"TikTok is horrible. It is so bad for everything in your life. If you have it on your phone, do yourself a favor and delete it."
2,"So, hello my name's Anna, I like anime. Want to be my friend?"
1,"Videos like this are so frustrating. Nearly all of this is advice given everywhere else anyway, RSD means things don't just ""sting for a couple of hours and then you're fine"", and THERE'S STILL A PANDEMIC. I know some countries have decided theirs is over because they're tired, I guess, but a lot of places are still overwhelmed. The idea of just ""joining a hobby group"" or the like while people in my city are dying at home because ambulances can't find an available hospital is simply cruel. We need advice that makes sense NOW, not in the world before the pandemic."
1,"I am 38 and lonely. Normal and social when circumstances request it (work,hanging out for a movie or dinner occasionally). I really find peace in being alone and lonely…don’t know why someone would suffer…you are just not seeing the good side of having enormous amount of time for yourself and real piece of mind due to not having other peoples problems troubling you."
2,I have many friends so I don’t know why I clicked this
1,"Anyone been feeling the other side of this coin? Feeling lonely with others instead of feeling lonely when alone? I feel like there's been whiplash from covid, during which no one could meet up or socialise, to now there being a frantic effort from some people to never be alone and to have something on all the time.

I've gone from feeling isolated during lockdowns -> excited to finally be able to hangout with people again -> burnt out because everyone wants to be doing something all the time and there's no rest. 

It's ironic, because there was the opposite issue during covid, but instead of stabalising I feel it's just flipped to the other extreme."
1,it's interesting to see how often food is the go-to activity for hang outs
1,"Why can't I manage to be alone, how can I be happy with minimum number of friends?
- What I, as an introvert actually wonder.
Cool video though."
1,"Thank you Kurzgesagt, I deeply needed this video today"
1,Its no problem bro i can communicate with people but still havent invited Anyone.
2,I lost my friends. Thanks
1,Please someone help me I'm begging someone to help me loudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_face please help me I'm begging someone to help me loudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_face
1, is the biggest hint ever lol.
1,I wouldn’t be surprised if one day there’s a Kurzgesagt video focussing on Insomnia at this point…
0,what if im not lonely
1,"Good, now make a video on how to get a girlfriend"
1,"I live in the country side alone, I have no friends cause it is a 30 min drive to town and gas is expensive."
1,But I'm not lonely. I'm certainly alone but not lonely. I enjoy my company.
1,I got curious with expanding my short list of tangential acquaintances into an actual friend group but after this video it turns out I want a pot plant instead.
2,Thanks for this
2,"While all this is nice and all, I'm good. I don't want any friends."
1,"For people here in Europe things certainly weren't made easier when Putin decided to start a war in Ukraine, right after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted.
My only weekly contact, my mother, got so afraid of a nuclear war (she lived through Soviet-occupied Poland and fled as soon as she was able to) that she booked a ticket to Australia just to feel safe."
2,Being alone has been the greatest gift of my life.
1,You know loneliness is a problem when Kurzgesagt did a video on this like 2-3 years ago
1,No birds bird in this video? bird
1,"I just feel doomed, every time, I 
hear or see that loneliness can 
bring upon a wide range of diseases.
I'm not alone by choice. Like, what
do I even do? I always get rejected."
1,This kept getting recommended to me for some reason.
1," I find it hard a specially challenging. I can invite everyone I know, their friends and yet. They all decline and wanna know how many there will be presence. And most of them who wanted to come, drops off at the very last second which hurts. And it has been going on for years. So therefor, Im tired and sensitive to bring people together because that most of the time never really work. And if it does, we never spend more time together after that situation. Even tho people state they really enjoyed the activity a lot."
1,Whoa this video is the exact thing I needed. Been feeling exceptionally lonely bad of late
1,"This is a very important topic and I'm glad that you made a video on it. It's an issue that I, like so many others, have been struggling with lately. Thank you."
1,That must be the first time I've heard the term upwards spiral
1,"This is the hardest thing for me, making conections. Interacting with others gives me a lot of anxiety  which I hide pretty easily considering the fact that I am usually told I’m friendly. But inside I’m always worrying and overthinking things to the point that it confuses people and I cause them to drift away. I genuinely appreciate the few friends that have stuck around although I feel I give them a hard time when I am on overly sensitive mode. Man idk, I feel like I’m either the friendly weirdo or the villain friend that lashes out. And all of these thoughts just spin around my head all day. I honestly  wish I could just turn them off, give myself credit for trying and enjoy an ice cream cone."
1,Shame most people are assholes. One short simple text is too much for them these days. Even just meeting up somewhere near to them for a coffee is asking too much…
1,"I've been the ""lone wolf"" since I was a teenager, with rare exceptions of moments when I suddenly had some friends and energy to make all I liked. It's painful having this personality almost my whole life. Having few friends or no one to share my feelings is now making me lose the track of my life, really. When I was younger, being a ""young-adult"" seemed a lot more interesting than it turned to be. Seeing my friends developing their lives, constructing relationships, marrying, having kids...and me with the same old lone-wolf stuff. Socializing hurts me now harder than before and I really don't know how to recover from this mental state. Totally great video."
2,Why Are You Naming Your Videos Like That?
1,Sometimes I really want to have friends but the other times I just wanna be all alone.
1,I can't do this anymore
1,A Jurassic Duck shirt would be amazing
1,"I'm making out with my partner and then he face_vomitingsaid he wanted to watch this shit.. Long story short, he's now my ex"

2,"Making Friend Is Easy , Keeping them is hard"
2,I love this my country just started f2f classes and i lost my miniscule social skills
1,"I often find it difficult to talk with someone about a topic I'm not interested in or knowledgeable about, but I've found that it helps to frame it to myself that I might not be interested in the topic, but I AM interested in my conversation partner's interest in it. So for example if a friend is talking about a hobby we don't share I do care and can ask questions about what they like about the hobby, what's difficult about the hobby, how the hobby makes them feel, etc."
1,"So the thing Joey starts to describe @ , I used to get all time on the way to college.

For me, I fall into a ""mini-dream"" like Garnt says, then the thing that wakes me up is my subconscious kinda tells me a dumb joke then I start laughing hysterically"

0,Death frees us from these mortal problems.
1,"Been feeling very lonely after a breakup a year ago. She painted me as an actual pedo to everybody, so EVERYBODY blocked me without me even knowing wtf was going on (she did this because she knew isolation was my biggest fear and she had never ""won"" a breakup before (her words) and a couple months after she broke up she called me saying she wanted me back, after I rejected her, the rumours came a few months later, around my birthday). Under the ""relationship"" she trained me to shut up and to let her be my thoughts and opinions. Now a year after independence I finally feel like I'm almost back to my former social glory. I had such a hard time even opening my mouth close to people, it took so many genuine friends that helped me every step of the way to find myself again."
1,"Jeez, Kurzgesagt really does know their audience"
1,"Hi, somebody there?"
1,"This is actually something I learned and realized when was in my early high school days. Because I moved so much I learned that the nature of maintaining relationships is highly dependent on proximity and value of interactions, which this video describes perfectly. That being said it became even more prevalent as now I'm in my early 20's so I've definitely noticed this happening to friends and I over the past few years."
2,Weekly/monthly meetup groups are indeed a good way to make friends in adulthood. Find a social activity you enjoy and get to know some people who share your interests!
1,"I really needed to hear this today, so thank you"
1,"I know you can't cover everything in a video, but it always makes it sound easier than it might be for some of us. 
I am good in social situations and don't really fear being in situations with new people. But due to trauma, I fear people getting too close to me. I also deal with a severe, chronic depression that has only been in remission for a few months now. I also have a little bit of social anxiety that resurfaced due to the depression and trauma.

Weirdly enough, the lock-down actually made me reconnect with old friends, that I now see on a monthly basis. But it is still hard for me to sometimes keep contact with people, partly due to my ADD. One day I'll realize I haven't spoken to someone in a wile, and should check up on them, but it's in the middle of me doing the dishes, and then I forget all about it afterwards. It is something I am working on, but establishing new relationships and maintaining existing ones, can be really hard if you struggle with mental illness."
1,i realize that my biggest obstacles in making friends are my social anxiety thats caused by bullying and lack of interactions with people and also my fear of opening up to new people. im 29 now and ive given up on making friends in a way that im open to any opportunities but im not chasing them anymore like i used to. it's overwhelming and maybe im destined to be alone bc up until now im still people's 2nd choice anyway
1,"Damn, I really got called out"
1, so no one's gonna bring up how smooth that dancing animation was?
1,"By the God Emperor, DUST OFF YOUR SPACE MARINES"
1,Am i the only one who noticed they used Catan for all the board games ?
1,How does Kurzgesagt know exactly what everyone is going through right now
1,"oh god the timing of this, we go jim :("
1,Making friends is easy. Keeping them isn't!
1,A sequel to the legendary Loneliness video. Thank you Kurzgesagt!
1,"I have too few friends because my interests and career are too challenging for most local people, and the things most people are interested in are mundane and simple-minded. I live in Trumpistan."
2,WTF SO I HAVE A SHORTER LIFE CUZ NOBODY WANTS TO BE MY FRIEND?!?!?
2,ok the title of the video made me feel personally attacked XD
1,I've given up on trying to connect with people. It's just not worth all the mental anguish
2,Imagine wanting or needing friends face_with_rolling_eyes
1,How about discuses the systematic issues that we face? You know like car centrism that inherently makes everyone more isolated compared to societies with more walkability and cycling infrastructure.
2,Just watched the video and I was thinking dam its sad how helpful it  is for me. Thank you for sharing an amazing video I genuinely love your guys videos thumbs_up
1,I'll start changing to day and spend more time with my beloved friends. Thanks  Kurzgesagt for a meaningful video smiling_face_with_hearts
1,"Besides time constraints, my issue is car dependent urban planning. I'd feel a lot more capable of making and sustaining friendships if i could easily cycle or electric scooter to their place, or a communal area. Doesn't exist here, even our light rail is 'car expectant' when you arrive."
1,ok this is literally way too accurate of an upload for me WTF
1,"I both have a hard time making friendships but even harder time maintaining or keeping them. I've had really good friends in high school but I don't talk to any of them anymore because everyone has moved on with their lives. But my biggest problem is I never feel the urge to call or text anyone anyway once I do find friends (which is rarely) even my own family I hardly talk to, not because I don't love them but I just don't feel any connection or desire to. It's very hard to explain. I've been alone my entire life I'm 34 single no kids. Being bounced around between foster homes and group homes until I was 13yo then I was adopted but I really feel no connection with anyone in my family and it doesn't bother me not seeing or talking to them for months or a whole year etc."
1,I was crying about how lonely i was earlier in the day and Kurzgesagt just wiped my tears
0,why are you attacking me?
1,kinda sad that this video got 3 million views in 3 days…
1,what the fuck why are kurzgesagt releasing videos specifically for me loudly_crying_face
1,"all these advices never work, everyone's life is different in the end, some people just have interests and personality that is very rare to match, thus the loneliness"
1,Unfortunately you didn’t cover the structural issues in society that makes it difficult to make friends. Really surface-level analysis. Social atomization is the biggest issue. Didn’t even ask “why don’t people have time?” which is the easiest question with easy answers. Yet instead you blamed an individual not “prioritizing” friend time. You guys are slipping.
1,The pandemic is really the biggest thing keeping me from meeting new people- And unfortunately that rages on and everyone around me keeps socializing with zero precautions while passing the virus back and forth like a bouncy ball so I just keep to myself
2,i made friends with someone by sharing love of kurzgesagt
1,I ain't lonely mf why does YouTube keep recommending thisskull
1,Youtube really just said *For You*
2,I feel like this video was made just for me lol
1,"Autistic person here who probably has chronic fatigue/permanent burnout. The largest barrier to getting rid of my loneliness is how tired I am and how overwhelming events outside are. 

Fortunately, sending memes to friends is always an option :D

I do visit friends in person, but not enough to fill up my social bar completely. Usually, I'm so tired by the end of the interaction that I haven't said barely anything that I wanted to say, so I don't leave feeling fulfilled.

I think the main focus is on getting more support so I have more energy to be with people in a meaningful way -- not in the I'm tired and overwhelmed and I can barely speak so all I can do is watch a movie with you in silence way. Watching movies together is wonderful, but it's not enough on its own.

Definitely going to adopt a cat at some point. That should help a lot. A cat would be a lot less overwhelming to interact with than people and is wonderful to pet and hug."
1,"One of the hardest things for me is accepting “invitations” and the like. A medical condition of mind makes that incredibly difficult. I’ve been doing better though.

What motivates me is the idea that “if I’m doing decent with this condition imagine how easy it’ll be if/when it’s fixed?”"
2,"I was starting to feel depresed cause i have little to no friends, thank yall, this did cheer me up"
2,"wow youtube took no time to recommend this to me, algorithm definetly knows me :D"
1,"I am actually very social, and guess what, GUESS WHAT! GUESS WHAT!! IM GAY!!! Just kidding haha, but yeah i have many friends and i also have a girlfriend while just being in school for less than 2 weeks idk how but i just did xd"
1,This episode is killing me because i got no one to really call 'Friend'
1,"My family moved a lot in my early years up into highschool and I think I developed something of a bridge-burning complex through those changes. To some degrees even during college. 

Staying in contact can definitely feel like a chore for some, so it often feels all too easy to let sleeping dogs lie as you notice distance growing between you and a friend. I'd guess that how a friendship formed plays a large role in this. It certainly takes commitment and time to restructure how you used to communicate and spend time together, both of which each party might not have enough of for EVERY ""ship passing in the night"". I do believe that letting go may sometimes be better for you mentally if you follow that up by seeking out new opportunities/hobbies/travels or looking inward and getting to know or grow your self."
1,I’m so isolated I’m probably gonna die soon. I feel like I’m too old to make close friends. Like everyone already had friends since childhood and don’t want any new friends. So I get left out constantly. It really hurts.
1,"This might would've helped five years ago, now I don't care about having friends no more. Being alone rocks"
1,"I feel attacked, how'd this video title know me so well?"
1,"Before the video even starts. I can tell you how you make friends. Be open-minded, don't be so sensitive and talk to people. It's that easy."
1,Never had such a relatable title
1,This is so weird to me as an extreme introvert. ever since I could remember even as a kid I never felt the need or want to be friends with anyone people often wanted to be friends with me but I was always really quite never talked to anyone so those people though I didn't like them so eventually they stopped trying. I know this sounds bad and I have tried to change but it's just not me. I can function perfectly fine around people btw like in a job for example. but it's different when someone just wants to have small talk
1,It seems that Kurzgesagt is reading my mind thinking_face
1,"there is no right or wrong, only right for you
 so simple yet effective"
1,"The answer is capitalism uprooting everything holistic and communitarian to  turn  every institution into a business, every person into a consumer, and every relationship into a financial transaction. But BillGatesGesagt isn't gonna tell you that. Stick to science assholes."
1,"I was about to click away, but it hit MY weakness at about . I meet tons of people, and they all seem to like to see me. But I can't seem to build one solid relationships."
2,"Not feeling like you belong somewhere can really mess you up. Thats why you need sincere, good friends"
1,"How terrible, I follow all this advice and dang I’ve even shared it with people, I am so driven by loneliness I figured out most of this stuff on my own. But I still get so lonely. If I am in a car for 20 minutes or at home for a few hours it strikes in vengeance. For some reasons any alone time is extremely painful, and I know I am weird that way. But people matter most to me, and it’s been that way as long as I can remember."
1,holy cow was kurzgesagt reading my mind??
1,"Thats too hard, i prefer to keep living in isolation, thanks."
1,It's better to be alone than surrounded yourself by peoples who DGAF about you! Stop watering a died flowers
1,"Introvert here. Being alone doesn't have to mean lonely. It also means peace, serenity, and being in control, free from drama, interruptions, and superficial social expectations, among other things."

2,This is what I’ve been thinking about for months now I love this :’)
1,This series is my favorite in this channel
1," They were hit by the politics, not the pandemic. It's not random that governments advocated social distancing and not physical distancing .."
1,"It shouldn't, but it feels so embarrassing to even admit that you feel lonely"
2,making  friends after highschool is hard
1,"Wow, the entire video was an ad for merch.

Can't go out and do ""fun things,"" whatever that means, living in the middle of no where and being broke and disabled. This stinks."
1,Damn yall really called me out
1,"But social circles can exclude quite thoroughly too, and we have no control over being excluded because of A, B, or C.  My own circle of friends is about 3 people in size."
1,If you had to search for this video instead of it being trending im with you crying_face
0,i feel bad clicking on this video
1,"And you see, this is why I don't use tiktok"
1,"I had to forget/move on from 7 friends in the past 2-3 years. I tried for so long. They just didn't want it, regardless of work, girlfriends, job, college, they had so many chances. Very little reciprocity. Im 24 so I know some of this is normal for growing up, but still....c mon man...... I held on too long to most of these connections and finally dropped them. I feel lighter and better for not having ""all that"" weigh on me."
1,Where does the social energy come from tho loudly_crying_face
1,I'm here just to learn English ' ͜ '
2,No but the thing about making good friends with me is that it’s easy but usually I don’t like their personality or their close friends so I just separate myself. And usually I need an only 2 other close friends relationship because if 2 of them get distracted there is always a third friend there to help but more than 2 other close friends is too much because then the better friend gets more attention
2,It was like this was the soln I was looking for
1,"This is the first tme i dislike one of your videos... very ambiguous usage of subjects that targets WEEK people with depression or on the contrary confusing people that are absolutely Independent  an absolute LAW of Individuals.. that is  
it is an absolute lie that YOU ARE SICK If you love beeing alone and cant find subjects that can be considered friends
NO you are not sick as this video could make you feel... jesus"
1,"I don't know about all this. Starting a friendship with a stranger is risky. You don't know their mental state, life situation, and intentions. You might end up being tied to a person you don't wanna be around."

1,You are perfectly average.
2,Who want to be my friend?
1,"Bruh how u know I got lonely this week ?
I'm feeling chills ngl"
1,"My daughter (technically stepdaughter) is battling this (granted there's lots of other factors as to why she acts the way she does): she can only do 1 person at a time, but that person gets 100000% of her attention (good and bad). She will literally say they are ""my best friend"" then after about 4-6 months (max) we never hear from them or see them again, not even a mention. And more often than not, it ended over something pretty lame. 

Sometimes I think: does your generation even know what ""best friend"" means? Do you know it actually takes work? (You might be friends but it IS a ""relationship"") If it was that easily tossed, were you even really friends? She seems to have friends as convenience (most of them anyways). 

The flip side (ie me): out of all of my groomsmen, the SHORTEST friendship I had was 14 yrs (high school). Even my wife doesn't have friends like that. She says it's weird, rare and super cute lol

Like I mentioned before, some things happened before me as to why she is how she is, but (like the video states) SHE has to put in the effort as well. You cant just sit back and expect people to come to you.

As simplistic and general Nikes slogan is, it's the truth. At some point you have to DO IT (starting off, it's probably something really small too)"
2,"naw, im okay with being alone. thanks."
1,I need this tysm
0,24 and lost all my friends. been too depressed to do shit.
1,"this is aimed at teenagers and honestly this is too optimistic and i can come up with the same principles by myself... look, i had two crews and a pair of single friends, i dumped all of em, why? bcs people are shitty, the main problem is not that you're shy or a weirdo or else, it's that you rarely find genuine positive people, for istance i just dumped a really old friend bcs i realized he became an idiot, he did ANYTHING is the opposite of what this video suggests to do to retain friends, being an ass as well... people bad treat you, the world is way more complex (and also simpler) than this... places to share your interests? maybe only if you live in a city and in the US... right now i just dwell online and have occasional ""single portion"" friends, meaning that when i find an ass i'm fighting with i need to give him just little time and pass over (thankfully)"
1,My prob is all my freinds talk like 1 hour without stopping and talks fast so I don’t understand and another 1 is absent like 5 days a week so I can’t communicate with him aaaand another 1 just 1 year not in the same class another year in the same class that’s what my BF did to me when I was with him this year he changed class just cause the ppl that were with us last year are in another class so he MOVED
1,"""Meeting people"" and ""making friends"" are the two most painful self-help topics for me.

Mostly because, like in this video, literally nothing they say hits the mark for me. Everyone's different and my life circumstances are such that I don't have the chance to even talk to another human being most days. So it's rough to see a video like this, which really makes it seem brutally easy to remedy isolation, while offering no usable advice.

It basically amounts to, ""Just go make friends,"" and I look around and there's literally no one I can have a conversation with anywhere. If you aren't east asian, south asian or white people in this town treat you like you're a transient, like you're not supposed to be here. I can't leave because of family illness. So when I see a video like this, I get angry because people apparently have such easily solvable versions of my problems."
1,"OOIIIIII loneliness girl is back and she has a new problem! lets comfort her by, idk, fanarting her?"
1,"okay but props to the store name ""Roll model: Model railway supplies"" rolling_on_the_floor_laughing"
1,Ah yes. Mine is perfectly average.
1,Not me having done 2 years of community college completely online and needing this video so bad lmao
1,Thank you for this video! Its interesting because i have only 3 friends and i play only online with them. I am going to school 3 times a week (because my autism) but the live 20miles away so i only see them on school and because i dont go to school very much i dont speak with them.. but i hope i can fix it now. I have be depressed many times.
1,"""So the most important principle of making friends is to regularly spend time with people in the real world"" 
Ah, darn it!

Tho in seriousness, I luckily don't feel the need to have more friends than I already have. 
I'm still watching this video, not just because I watch everything Kurzgesagt makes, but also more a just in case thing"
1,Am I the only one seeing the Peter Lustig waggon ?
1,Me the silent kid at school: im speechless
1,"this is so scary, how does kurzegesagt keep making the videos of things i'm interested in the most at the right time?"
1,"Saying this as someone who was an introvert with high-functioning social anxiety and had to expand her social circle this year after lockdowns: You can ABSOLUTELY make more/new friends! You just have to put the time and energy into it. Make sure you're not confusing ""party"" friends for ""chill/deep"" friends or that you can find a group to do both. I have more friends now that I'm almost 30 than I did when I was in high school and wouldn't have it any other way."
1,"I've been a loner since middle school and I'm still a loner in my junior year.

I have this thing when I'm friends with someone either online or in real life, I've become bitter towards them. And when I don't have anyone, this feeling goes away. I don't understand nor get what it is but it feels as if my body got used to barely or no human connection that it refuses to accept anyone else. 

 I guess this is what being alone does to you in the process, huh?"
1,Thank you Kurzgesagt. I was literally pondering this as you released this video
1,For me it's cos I'm too bust in survival mode I have no energy and I hate I long for my school days were i saw my friends all day we all had little responsibility lots of energy and freedom I was studying subjects I liked I had so much hope then the real world snapped me out and showed how not all in life is fair and sadly money and how rich the family you were born into matters a lot hate it here
1,I feel personally targeted.

2,Thanks for this video I have been seeking how to make friends cos been very lonely for over 2 years
1,"Its quite hard to make new friends, especially if you live abroad. Im in Dublin for my 7th year and never really made any friends. Just working, spending time with my girlfriend and online with some old friends. At least I have a comfortable job and a roof over my head."
1,"This was very insightful to me. I was struggling with loneliness this year as the community and girl I liked was lost and ever since I felt like I couldn’t make new friends. I miss the people I once knew but am afraid I’ll never get to speak with them again, they asked me to leave them alone after a rough breakup earlier this year, I still see those friends online but am afraid to text them and struggle to move on"
1,I reckon this video rekindled a lot of friendships. Top stuff.
1,"Thankyou youtube video, I will take this advice to heart"
2,"Beautiful!!!! Thanks!! We really needed this topic, so glad you made it guys! You are the best!!"
1,I don’t feel like I want “more friends” I feel like I want to be able to express myself genuinely and have more authentic connection. “Having friends” means nothing if it is not on your own terms. Often it is autopilot or out of security or convenience or whatever.
1,Kurzgesagt never fails to amaze me with their videos
1,see this is why i dont have tik tok
1,"I realized early on that my energy levels couldn't sustain the average friendship. I have limited mental and physical energy to even sustain myself, muchless constant attention to someone else on top of everything else in life. As a result I found making online friends so much more preferable because then I could take the time to find people who genuinely were okay with the abilities I do have to be a friend. Now I have people I've known for decades and no matter how much time passes, there's a mutual agreement we'll always be on each other's side whenever needed. As it turns out, I think knowing that you're not on your own in this world is what some of us truly want rather than someone to constantly entertain us."
1,"I had a very close friend before the pandemic. We had been friends for most of our lives, and i really enjoyed spending time with them. The pandemic tore that to shreds. While communication with them was difficult on account of our parents not being as close as we are, the pandemic basically eradicated any chance i had to spend time with them. I haven't seen them in a year and it hit me really hard, as it was way more difficult to interact with others knowing that it could end so abruptly."

I've had to distance myself from people that used to be my ""best friend"" because they did something that is my red line, just awful things... of course differing opinions is fine but there are somethings that I will not stand for & abuse is one of them."
1,Did he just roast you
1,"Something this video didn’t talk about is ‘Toxic Friends’. 
Your desire to make new friends might blind you to the fact that the person, or people you are trying to befriend are toxic, and not good for you self esteem and mental well-being. 

If you find yourself continuously excluded from social events, or chats, or find you’re always the butt of the joke, or the stand in friend when no one else is around, the people you’re trying to befriend may be toxic, and not worth your time. 
It’s not always something you can see right away, and your desire to have friends might blind you to it, but everyone deserves true friends that care about you. 
So never stop trying to make connections, and make true friends :)"
1,"Ur never too old, akward, or weird to have friends. There will always be someone in the world who wants to be close to you, sometimes you just have to be willing to give some effort"
2,Welp let's play after this vid that I can get friends
1,Been dealing w this issue for what feels like years now
1,"My whole life people told me I need to socialize and make friends. I was always asked why the heck I have no friends and am always alone. I was told that there are health and mental problems to being alone. I am now 30 years old, happily married and have no friends and barely leave my house, unless I need to buy more wood. I spend most of my days perfecting my hobbies and creating stuff, but I never had a yearning for social interactions. As long as I have my wife I have zero need to ever talk to another human being. And I am perfectly happy and healthy and thriving. Although this life is not for everyone I think it is important to realize that hermits just exist. They can exist even in populated densely packed cities in which I live. It is just that no one can do research on a hermit because they are happy being by themselves and no one will ever really see them. So due to that if one is depressed because they are not social, research is being done on those and deduction is made that, hey these lonely people are suffering and it is because they have no friends. And I do not think that there is any health issues related to being alone as long as it truly is what one desires and is comfortable with. So lesson is, be comfortable with yourself and try to be best version of you that you can and spend your time dedicated to creation rather than consumption. Get off tik tok and youtube and just create and learn and live. Social interactions are optional."
1,"Good video but no acknowledgement about making friends online some of which are my closest and I've never met f2f. Assumption you need a board game,  club or bowling alley nearby is a serious generalisation"

This really looks like kel, right? And the flowers blooming... maybe I'm looking too far into it, anyways this was a good video!"
1,nice vid. It partially inspires me to have a little more faith in humanity--it's just so often in my experience that people are so fickle and insecure (not completely counting myself out of that camp at times) that we ruin it before a mutual dynamic is even fully formed. Either that or folks turn out to be exploitative weirdos with no respect for boundaries.

1,"For an introvert, I am quite friendly with people but I guess that I still put walls around me that makes me look reserved and unapproachable to other people. I like talking with people, but I am unable to do that for too long with people I don't know. And my sollege studies are stressing me out which is another reason for my reserved nature. But I do reach out and do my best to help people when I can. But real friendships are so worth our time, so let's not give up and do our best to show the people we care about that we care too."

1,"I am the singular cyan dots at . In elementary school I had a best friend, then in high school I wasted too much emotional energy desperately trying to keep in touch with him as he made new, better, cooler friends as we both aged. When I graduated high school I decided to never give him the light of day online again until he reaches out to me. This was the case with all of my friends; I was everyone's 21st, 33rd or 40th friend but no one's primary friend, and no one was my primary. I fucking loathed every second of high school and I wouldn't go back if I was offered a billion dollars."

1,This was very much needed. I recently left a cult  I grew up in because I don't share their believes anymore and all the people I grew up with shunned me. Now I only have 1 friend in real life.

1,"The problem with some is they start sharing their live stories or how their day was shit, ask for big favours without thinking about others, always talk about money or money problem, always engage in one or other activities and try to involve other even if the other is not interested in that (It's true for most extroverts). 

Then they say all my friends are fake bla-blaa, yada-yada, ""loneliness"" and post all over social media as if others don't have any problems (and remind other about their problems). Which they think will somehow give them some kind of a relief but instead make them less attractive or let others think ""I better not be too friendly with this person"""

1,"this video was made especially for the discord users out there, incels and losers because L + Ratio and skill issue, just join hustlers university and stay on the grind, that is the only thing that will bring you happiness if you aren't a beta male."
1,"I just want to point out that it doesn't work like that after thirties. Virtually all people you meet when you're thirty-something, regardless of the commitment you want to put into the relationship can at most be ""acquaintances"" not ""friends"". Friend is somebody you known for the majority of your life, like a relationship formed back in school, maybe for some at the uni, tops. Later in life you can have a group of people you casually call ""friends"" in the skewed american meaning of that word, but you'll never be as important or as significant to each other like the people you literally grew up with. That means that after becoming an adult you already have a set number of friends, which can only go down from there. Some friends decide to unilaterally break contact, some move to the other side of the world not to be seen again, others get locked out of social interactions by their toxic spouses or die in accidents or from diseases. Over time your pool of friends only diminishes and you can never go back in time to form more of the same high-quality bonds. Sure, you can try to fill the void with new people, but it'll never be the same and frankly, going out for drinks, doing sports or watching movies once a week is not friendship, it's a fake facade put by people in similar situation trying to push meaningless interactions to plug the void they fill."

1,"I’m in my sophomore year of music school and it’s so hard sometimes. The music major is so small that there’s only about ~100 of us total, so once people find their groups is really really hard to get into social circles. Last year I only had one friend and she’s off at basic training now. It’s hard. I’ve been very sad about it BUT I decided I was going to work really hard and try stepping out of my comfort zone to make friends. Two days ago I went over to a friends house where she had her friends that I didn’t know at all and I played games with them. It’s definitely something out of character for me. But it was fulfilling to connect with people again. It has made me hopeful."

1,There's also something to be said for the quality of friends you surround yourself with. If you have friends but they make you feel bad then you probably shouldn't be friends with them and you should use the tips from this video to find some who do make you feel better.

1,"All my friends left me. I had a friend for my whole life whom I could go to, she distanced herself from me, ignored my texts, and left. That one hit hard. I recently found a friend, and we had lots in common. One day she said that she didn’t want to sit with me in class, and stopped talking to me, and answering me. I cry myself to sleep, I feel like no one wants to be my friend. I feel unwanted, not needed. But maybe, I feel that maybe it’s because I’m not pretty, or even average, I’m fucking ugly, and maybe… just maybe if I wasn’t, I’d have more friends. Now I turn to books, and writing, because they’re always there for me, they don’t leave me, they don’t care what I look like. Maybe it’s just me, but I just can’t seem to win. I just want one friend, ONE."

1," Friendship does not require closing someone in the prison of school. You can meet someone for a minute and be friends for life. Friendship and bondage do not come together. If you need to be locked to fulfill social needs, you lose your natural ability to make friends"
1,"This was a really touching video and I appreciate the effort going into his animation and the music in it.

I've had to move a lot of times in my life and I end up following out of older friend groups. The time we are able to hang out together is more limited and I usually end up feeling left out when they're still able to hang out with other friends we knew but turn me down.

I did make a couple new friends after moving and I hope I'm able to get closer to them and make more friends. It's kinda hard to maintain them when you have bad anxieties and feel bad for asking them to hang out with you. It does feel like I'm bothering them."

I feel like at some point I gave up and now I go to work and go home and repeat and allow Netflix to take over the weekend. I need to make a change cause living like this is terrible. I have a fiancé and child but they are also living in Colombia waiting for me to bring them to the states so it is extra lonely and heartbreaking not to have them around only restricted to the visits I can make wile her process advances. I can’t believe I’m writing and tearing up realizing that although I know many people I am so alone. I definitely know it’s mostly in my part and that I made it more difficult than it really is, I feel like depression has something to do with it as well. Hopefully I’ll try to do better and meet new people as I am well aware that as soon as my wife arrives she will start felling what I have been feeling all this time. At least by then will have each other. Sorry so long but writing it down hear helps for some reason."
1,Finally!  An answer to my troubles!
1,"[Confused stare]
Why would I want to make friends in the first place? 

(The below has strong ""me"" vibe, but I don't have the experience to write a generalized comment, so ""me time"" it is)

The video says about the investment of time and effort, but what are the benefits?
The point is presented like having friends, and more friends is absolute necessary and undisputable, and frankly, I don't get it.

I mean, it looks like a lot of hassle to try and interact with someone on semi-scheduled basis while trying to remember any meaningful details about them.
Sure, I do meet with people to do some meaningful things (art performance, game modding), but at the end of the day its just another kind of 'work', then we go our ways. I don't really know much about them except vague 'these two are twins', 'this guy learns trumpet', 'this guy made xyz software thingy'.
It is hard enough to remember the immediate family and cousins - what they do for living (that could be useful to me), birthdays (can only remember the month for 3 of 6 of them), and please don't ask me their spouses names...

I find it an extreme idea to try and meet more people when interacting with current set is hard enough. The video says to make friends, but doesn't explain what for. And what is friend actually?? Is the bunch of nicknames I chat with on discord and can vaguely remember personality traits 'friends'? Then yay, I have like 10 friends (who are in fact 15 different people, because I just mix them up).
Or to be a friends you need to actually ""know some secret about each other"", like some cartoon said, and maybe actually meet from time to time?
I don't feel that invested with anyone, so my friends set has total count of zero.

Does family count as friends? I can actually mostly remember how they look like, which month is their birthday (kinda), what they work as, how many kids they have and what kind of car they drive! (Its null, null, sedan, truck, sedan, sedan)
(Given I tend to not learn a work teammate name if they haven't been on the project for several months, that must mean I care, right?)

Not trying to troll here, (well maybe a bit, to gather some feedback). Given the tone I'm writing, I'm wondering if I'm trying to be autoironic, asking for attention, or just realizing how bad at social interactions I am."
1,This channel just gets better every video! And the make friends idea is awesome!
1,"hi, does anyone want to be freinds?"
1,these kinds of videos always confuse me because the most popular people I know usually have none of the traits people say you need to be popular
2,I am loving the music in this video
1,"I haven’t had any friends since junior year of high school, This video opened my eyes to a few things, yes. But it’s a lot harder nowadays to make friends than this video specifies. It is correct about TikTok, though. 100% correct."
1,only now have I realised how many friends I actually have and how much I actually have in common with them
2,Glad Im done with that trash.
1,So um...who wants to be friends? Hi I'm Shaniaslightly_smiling_face
1,right
1,"Yeah the pandemic definitely broke a lot of things. The years forced to go online we’re probably prime social life time, and while I was part of a great group of people I loved before it, online definitely brings some drifting. I’d still consider myself close with a couple of them but all those years online really must have broke something in everyone’s head because once we all came back things fell apart between people pretty quickly. Im still friends with some of them, and even close with others, but the group as a whole is done for. It sucks a little to see almost found family broken up like this but I guess it wasn’t my first time so it’s just…whatever. A bit bummed. Ah well."
1,i am surprised this isent this guys most popular video already
2,I have all the friends in the world thank you very much
1,"Theres a difference between being alone and feeling loney. Realisticly,the less friends you have,the less chances of betrayal. Because your enemies wont betray you,its your friends that do that."
2,I need more friends weary_face does anyone want to chat?. I’m over 18 so I would prefer adults. Just want friends to talk to :(
1,"The bit about ‘social networks’ reminded me about how my parents and grandparents wistfully remembered older times in Germany (as recent as the 1960’s) when no one would travel further than the nearest big city their entire lives. Most families apparently had four generations living within a few miles.
America doesn’t quite have that... and it’s a shame. Familial friendships are, in my opinion, some of the strongest out there; and when you only see the other person one or two days out of the year, they fade into the background. What a shame."
2,Thank you. I needed this.
1,The hardest part about loneliness I've found is believing I deserve friends.
1,"Wouldn't it be great if all the people in chat complaining they don't have friends,  became each other's friends. If only we had technology that allowed us to contact each other that was cheap and easy to use.  Oh well, it was a nice thought."
1,So accusing
1,"Easier said than done...(especially when I have Asperger's).  Also, I will reiterate what I said (iirc) on the Loneliness video:  Not all who are alone are lonely."
1,There are snakes everywhere broken_heart
2,I joined a fraternity in college. I’m still friends with guys from there. After college I joined the Freemasons. I’ve got so many friends it’s hard for me to keep up with them all.
1,"As your said, it takes a lot of energy to keep friends... yet I've put in a lot of energy into my friendships and my friends have been ignoring me. I feel isolated no matter how hard I try"
2,"we’re all lonely here, anyone wanna be friends?"
1,It's like if you watch this you don't have many friends. I know that i have friends but they aren't like my great or best friend so i get left out of a lot of things they do in the group. I don't have that easy time opening up to pleople as well since I'm introverted and shy. It's quite tough to be honest and i have 0 friends that are girls unlike other's in my friends group.

1,"I ran a sports club for years and didn't make one lasting friendship. Not only that, the club got stolen right under me by 2 a-holes. Just to be clear, the club wasn't ""Mine"" in that I started it, it was an established club that had a change in leadership and I stepped up when no one else did, growing it to twice its size with two other awesome core people. I eventually got voted to president, I thought I could put my feet up a little. WRONG. It's funny and ironic, what it taught me was why dictators/CEO/Bad boss do what they do. Once you accumulate that much power even accidentally, if you try to democratise, not matter how good your policy or systems, without an iron fist and do bad things to maintain your hold, you will get taken out.

The worse thing about all this wasn't that I didn't make any lasting friends, it's that the club kept me sane in the dark times and after putting that much effort in that hurts the most."
1,"Don't trust these guys, it's a trap, they're on the globalist agenda's payrol, they're spouting crap that will probably sink you to even more depresion. Want to have friends and be happy? Go about the old ways back before the 2000s, before internet and mobile phones, social media was invented, make real human connections, and don't be afraid to challenge and get challenged by people, that alone will make you dozens of REAL friends, not fake virtual BS ones, and do the same when looking for a partner, and you'll see changes REAL in your life, but for good."
2,This is a really interesting video well done! POG

1,"Learn how to live alone and you won’t ever feel the need to have friends in order to escape loneliness. Plenty of shit to do on your own.

Out of my Friends I only have one I actually ever met in person. And I can’t even interact with him because he lives far away from me. And most of my friends are online. Sometimes I find friend interactions more valuable than holidays.

1,"It's not that easy though, is it? It's *never* as easy as motivational videos like this make it seem. What about a genuine lack of time? Inability to choose things like your work? Or, worst of all, crippling social anxiety, *knowing* that the other person doesn't want to talk to you even if a rational part of you knows it's not true, you still can't convince yourself of it. And if the other person doesn't actively try, you're screwed."
1,...I feel like YouTube is trying to say something by reccomending me this
1,"This was written by an extrovert, obviously."
1,"Yeah, but what if I'm actually just an unlikeable asshole?"
1,Me watching this knowing damn well im not going to try and make friends anytime sooneyes
1,"For an ""introvert"" like me I find myself pretty open, or so I think...
I don't fear rejection at all, so long as there's a common topic at hand, I say a few things (never had I talked about the weather). 

From what I can tell by 'observing' myself, I _think_ I'm good at starting but never maintaining.
I ignore the majority of online messages and I hardly go out of my way to reach out if it isn't convenient. As stupid, selfish and unreasonable as it sounds, I also want to blame them for not reaching out to me most of the time.
So everything just becomes ""Talk when only talked to"" and so everything related to online messaging hardly becomes personal.
Even the slightest physical segregation is enough to sever it, a simple difference in class designation is enough even if our classes are beside each other. Those who have gone even a slightly different path from me would just be split like that and we've never heard of each other ever again.

I can't help but to feel like I've only made ""close acquaintances"" and not exactly ""friends"".
Maybe it's caused by my lack of presence? Maybe I don't have a desirable personality? Maybe I didn't open up enough so they still feel unwelcomed?

Oh well, I probably am thinking to much anyway. I have a simple friend group that's active on Discord and everything isn't ""businesslike"" so I can start from there.
I have friends."

1,"Space marines are for gits!

1,"There was a point in time where church was a perfectly reasonable place to find friends, and this may be the fault of many churches, but too often is it just a place to go before going elsewhere, so there's a very small window to actually socialize. I'm also willing to bet that a lot more churches would have it more together and be more convincing to their own members if more of their members were actually friends with each other, and not simply friendly, regardless of doctrine.

As it stands, churches are terrible places to meet people even though people regularly go there. Or maybe that's just me speaking as a Catholic, because that's how a lot Catholic parishes have been. Can't say if the same is true for many protestant communities, although I hear some of them do an excellent job of making sure any newcomers have plenty of opportunities to socialize and engage."

In the past many people, ( Girls ) would say good about me and love me,respect me,guys would be cool with me as friends also,BUT not all  Girls loved me ( many would say you are ugly )  well not my fault. Now i feel soooo left out and surrounded by negative energy at all times. So if anyone wants to comfort me here I am."

0,What if I want to be lonely?
1,i am alone i dont really have friends just people i know. i just feel that i cant trust people like i tell things to the people i know and they just tell other people i dont know. sometimes they tell to people i dont know somtimes personal which i wont tell to them. and i feel that maybe i make a bad first impression.. i guess because i have gotten used to being alone and dont know how to keep and start a natural conversation. it could be that i am a introvert so people dont understand that and they think i am boring i dont know maybe alot of factors at play. sometimes i guess i wish i had a best friend but i dont. to do things with i have thought that if i were to get married who would be my best man.. and i dont have a answer and that makes me sad. i guess i could go out more there are places i know but i dont know. i guess there is alot to talk about with me..

1,Nah. Let's dive deeper into the genetic manipulation tech and find out what make solitary animal solitary. Isolate the core factor and modify ourselves so don't crave or need friends. This way we will truly ascend from being filthy apes.
1,"Before I watch this I'm going to say my thoughts. I think friends can be a paradox, they are harder to make when you have less, but at the same time, the more you push yourself out of your comfort zone AND the more hobbies you push yourself into, the more friends you will make. Also worth noting that number of friends should not be important, but the quality of those friends and the quality friend you yourself are. Common interests are important, especially for males in my experience."

I've been moving all around Europe (and a lil bit to Canada) in the past 7 years and now that I'm 30 I can feel how disconnected I am from people so this hit close"
1,Good video but everything in here is common sense doesn't anybody get that

Me: And I took that personally... and proceeded to watch the entire thing smiling_face_with_tear"
0,I hate people...
1,"Don't be afraid to call old friends! In my experience, it takes no time at all to lock back into the chemistry you had before. You'll be surprised how easy it will be, and you probably worry too much that it won't be the same!"
1,"I love how this was posted the day I was about to text a friend and tell them how burned out, lonely and unfulfilling I've been feeling"
1,You're never alone being lonely purple_heart
1,"Meeting new people and making friends are two of the best things for me. The last few years with the pandemic has been rough but I'm moving to Norway in a few months and I'm really looking forward to all the new, interesting people that I'll come across. Whether at work, out for walks/hikes, or with other hobbies like tabletop gaming, miniature painting, photography, or board gaming. :D 

Seriously though, if you're in Bergen, hit me up!"
0,Lose yourself on mindless activity: Facebook Reels
1,"In high school I always wanted to have more friends, but I never wanted to have things like snapchat or Instagram because I was afraid of not knowing how to use them and embarrassing myself. I also blame my actual friends who left me out of everything outside of school for a reason I still don't know. They're no longer my friends, but in college, by studying abroad and allowing myself to work in public areas, I found a friend group that appreciates me and allows me to have fun and feel like I belong."
1,"If you're bored you're boring 
If you're lonely you needs to learn self respect. 
You don't need friends just like you don't need pets. Both are nice, but if you can't exist without them that's a failure of character."
1,"Have been struggling to make friends or even be around others since classes started back in person.
This brought a tear to my eye :')
Ty Kurzggesagt"
1,"*_1_* From the time we are born, we are heavily conditioned by society, tradition, and customs.
*_2_* We must teach our children at a very early age to think on their feet, to stand alone, to not follow the crowd, to not bear bullying and hazing, and to not act like robots.
*_3_* The self causes most problems and all wars—self-importance is our doom.
*_4_* Happiness is within us, not in the society we live in or in the company we work for, not in how many friends we have or in how many followers we have on social media.

1,not kurzgesagt calling me out...smiling_face_with_tear
2,Great video! Hope you guys know how much we appreciate your videos!
1,"Kurzgesagt feels likes my parent talking about life while saying ""research shows"" alot"
1,"Honestly when I got notification about your latest video, I feel like you made it especially for me."
1,The meme potential is endless
1,Kurzgesagt making self improvement videos lately and I love it.
1,"I get what the video is saying, but I live in rural Mississippi where the average person is a knuckle dragger.  I have a master's degree in biochemistry and spent a significant amount of time around people who were much smarter and easier to talk to.  Trying to make friends here is impossible because I cannot relate to these people."
1,"I was super tired after work today and didn't feel like going to game night, but I went and I'm glad I did! My friend invited me to an amateur theater group, which is an opportunity I never would have learned about if I stayed home tonight."
1,why'd this literally drop in the middle of the night while I try to sleep thinking about where'd all my friends go :')))
1," 
I can say this statement is crap.
People don't give a crap about you which I have come to realise in the past few years and decide to ignore you even when you try."
1,"New word We learned today: truel 
Also the astonishing information by the Kurzegaestred_heartlink"
1,"Jurassic duck?
I wanna see that movie"
1,I dont know if its a coincidence or kurzgesagt is spying on me but this video came out right when i got to the peak of me feeling lonely
2,i lost all my friends because moving to other country
1,why don't I rip up grass at my dad's?
1,"Having just moved to a new city, this is at the forefront of my mind. This meetup could not have come at a better time. Here's hoping some life-long friendships spring forth from this experiment. =)"
1,Thank you for another valuable video heart_exclamation
1,"I moved to a different country for love a year ago and in that time hadn't made any single friend, not even casual. I am very aproachable and friendly person but it seems like everyone has their group of friends and applications to those groups are closed. For the most time i feel like there is nobody for me in this city."

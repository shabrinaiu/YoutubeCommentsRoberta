1,i like to play video games but when i play alone i feel empty and unmotivated this is my current problem that affect my daily routines too
1,POV- u watched this video instead of hanging out with your friends face_with_tears_of_joycrying_face
1,Kurzgesagt really calling me out with this video loudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_face
1,How to make new friends? Just dont by ugly... Blackpill is brutal
2,Why wouldn't lonely people meet to become friends?
2,"No birds :( 


jk cool video tho"
2,Coworkers are NOT friends!! Don’t ever forget that!
2,The fact that this was in my recommended says a lot lol
2,Ok i just want to now why i click on this vedio
0,Can you make an episode about anti-black racism and why every race/nationality seems to hate us?
1,Dang I wish you could do the friendship meet up again sometime in the future I’m 3 months away from being 18
1,"“Why you are lonely…”
HOW DO THEY KNOW?!"
1,"I'm a 24 year old hermit :) Everyday, i got to work, i play videogames, and then go to bed, And that's okay because thats pretty much my comfort zone"
1,although I feel like the first and last 20-30 seconds are unnecessary
1, Looks like an undercover minion found his way into the video.
1,"Your lonely because stay inside all day, don't communicate with people, don't try to socialize in public spaces , Don't try anything new or exciting"
2,I like the proximity thing. Its cool
2,why is this recommend to ne i m not that helpless to need  a youytube tutorial to make friends
1,I moved to the states recently and it's actually super lonely here. It's not just me. I see hundreds of people everyday who put on fake smiles. I can tell a lot of these people are super lonely. This world is cruel man. But I suppose there's always the bright side to things too. Maybe I haven't seen it yet.
2,Nice roasting face_with_tears_of_joy
1,What I need is family not friends... I want people who actually live with me and have a history with me. A bunch of strangers that don't get me or where I came from doesn't help loneliness it makes it worst.
1,Everything outside is either boring or awfully expensive
1,"I saw this video at the right time, I'm 25 now, I never really made an effort to be friends with anyone until now, but I've always been curious about people in general. Great video for viewers of all ages & backgrounds! Keep up the good work!"
1,Bro this video was targeted man
1,"We are doing a lot of meeting now in milan, but we are 19 girls on 305 members
So saad"
1,"OMG I JUST texted my friend seconds ago that I can't seem to make any friends in college, and then I get this notification loool"
2,LOL because i am youtuber always making content or editing lol
2,Alright Kurzie. Not cool for you to blatantly call me out like this
1,"Without watching the video, I'm guessing it has something to do with: Social media. People living and showing fake lives online. A lack of actual, in person community.   Being preoccupied with things you can't control. A fractured culture. 

Am I close?"
0,So depressing yet entertaining
1,I'm living proof that you don't need to have friends to be happy
1,So related
2,"Very important video!

Caring and sharing is key!"
1,"Bullying by your own parents also exists, speaking from experienceunamused_face"
1,"I have literally none, not even online. 

Due to the pandemic, i couldn’t go to a normal school and had to go to one where there is literally no socializing with other students. You do your school work and you leave. 
Im really fricken lonely man loudly_crying_face"
2,Who here agrees that having a small friend group with nice people is better than having a larger friend group with *okay* people
2,I'm glad that I watched this
0,might be the most depressing episode
1,"I cried during this video :,  )"
2,"Just wondering, is zero too few? Asking for a friend."
1,"*_""As we grow older, we start realizing that most of the people we used to call friends didn't have much of any significance in our life""_*
- Harsh & bitter truth"
1,"I used to have a decent friend network and it all turn to crap to the point im just too reluctant, and reserved to talk. Ive alwahs been an introvert but now im just anti-people."
2,I am tire to keep friendship because too many argue when meet again. But make new friend is ok.
1,I love this video because it doesn’t make me feel alone just of all the views who are having trouble making friends makes me feel that am not alone and am not the only one with this problem
1,"How to make friends? Easy
Stop being toxic, and people will want to be around you
I guess it's nearly impossible though, for people who grew up entitled/dysfunctional."
0,No bitches?
2,"Bold of you to assume I’m lonely! 







I mean I am, but still very bold"
1,Now this is getting personal loudly_crying_face
2,I love all your videos but this was one of the best ever
1,This is a particularly hard topic for me and I never ever thought I would cry with a kurzgesagt video. Thank you.
1,im happy to say that i do not have to watch this video. this would not have been the same  a few years ago. good day
1,I thought this was a fake channel and that this was one of the joke videos.
0,Finally when close friends whine about being lonely I can send them a link to this
2,Wow. This is so perfect
1,This just made me want to not be on this earth even more than usual....
2,No thanks im good.
1,"well at least someone knows what is up,.. how can I live in close proximity to friends with covid-24 around the corner? less masks, more connection, no more bullshit, lets get truthful about our lives."
1,"Sometimes, there is a huge battle of ego. Like ""why should I be the one to reach out and make plans all the time, why can't the other person do it too"", or ""well that person hasn't contacted me in a long time, so why should I contact them"", etc.
Making friends would be easier if both parties put in the same amount of effort into building the friendship."
1,"Make friends or spend valuable time with the one you have gets pretty hard when university crushes all your time and you need marks for fucking scholarships because you're poor and need to escape that situation and AAAAAAAAAGH. This sucks. Also sucks losing scholarships, being thus confined at your conspiracist parents' home to study, unable to start the therapy you'd have started while living far from them the decently sized city you study in. Especially sucks when all the friends you made during uni are there."
2,Love your stuff man
1,The rise in people working from home scares me because I think a lot of people are gonna struggle to make friends without heading into a shared workplace.
1,"how much CATAN did the illustrator played 
Never seen so much of it to define board games"
1,If you suffer from lonelyness put down the phone quit twitter stop posting updates on hating men touch grass go to school talk to your step parents lifeis a miracle that twitter takes the faster you understand the more life you get dream isnt gay the earth is real just as you being a human being can be but you can be a human just PUT DOWN YOUR PHONE DELETE TWITTER
1,"Alright, I feel violated by the title"
1,"I was lonely for most my life and later got jumped. I started boxing for self defense, but every time i got my ass kicked the other guy would help me get better then we would be friends. 4 years later, Now I’m in TKD and meet people all across the country. I thought not having friends was ok and I just wanted to be strong, but without the friends I made I wouldn’t have gotten stronger. 
Whenever I see a new white belt teen who started because they were being bullied, I make sure we always practice with other white belts and kata with higher belts. They get friends and I get to feel nice about myself. My two cents but I found my best friends were the people who could kick my ass and take a beating too"
2,Bro I just couldn’t stop laughing when I saw this in my recommended
0,"damn, why you spying on me like that?? flushed_faceflushed_face"
1,Fun fuct : there are more people that you know than boats in the sky
1,"Nah, outdated information. We are slowly (for human perception of time) evolving into a non social species and you are delaying the process for some reason. Check your priorities Kurzgesagt!"
1,Oof I’m currently in a completely different country very far from the few friends I had lol. I guess this is one I should listen more than once.
1,This video couldn't have come out at a better time in my life. Thank you so much for making this video <3
2,people love me and I love them and am really good at communicating( I can talk about almost any topic with confidence) positively all the time. Big fam so kinda grew up in it. Good luck you'll where all out here together and we should always be there for our fellow brothern and let them know there not alone.  Emotional support really helps with mental health. Best of luck to you'll journey
2,"This is the best timing. I’ve been searching for a point in life since i changed school and lost all my friends, but now i’m motivated to do new ones. Thanks. You’re really helping me out."
0,No I don't want friends they suck. Unsubscribed.
0,How did u know I’m lonely.
0,Bruh I feel insulted that this is in my notifications
0,Reported for this vicious self attack!
1,Imagine being so lonely that you re watching this vid(im watchin too)
1,"Learn to like being alone, it will not be a waste of time at all"
1,other thing that people need to know is not taking things personal i know is something that has been alredy said but i think is something very important that yall need to understand
1,I like the Catan easter egg.
2,"I needed this, thank you!"
1,Science more that not this nerd_face
1,"The problem is that, some people, no matter how much effort they put into making friendships, no matter how much courses they participate, how much time they workout, no matter how much they practice socializing to create connections, they simply won't be able to do so... Honestly I'm not sure what happens, is that an aura thingy, or perhaps they never learned how to properly socialize when they were children, or something in their appearance/behavior only allows them to make acquaintances at best, or they are easily replaced/abandoned for other people... Wish I could know why though."
1,"it's funny how i'm practically incapable of starting conversations with others but if one is started i could talk for hours, if it's about something i want to talk about"
1,The pandemic didn't stop people socialising. It was the government rules.
2,"Another good advice I was given once: If you struggle with contacting a friend you haven't seen in a while because you fear rejection, think about it. Would you hate it if an old friend sent you a text out of nowhere ?"
1,"Im stranded in a country since covid started thats how im losing touch with my friends. Now im only meeting people in online games, my job has very few colleagues who are completely not in the generation as me"
1,"The sad part is that for most of our history this was not only completely natural and obvious, but required for survival.
And now... it's still required for survival, but we've somehow convinced ourselves, as a society, that we can replace these hard-won connections with others with simple, immediate-gratification machines. 
Like, nothing in this video is complicated or unexpected. But still it's not something a lot of people actually prioritize, despite having the desire to have friends. (Indeed, prioritizing much of anything beyond the immediate moment has become seemingly impossible for a lot of people.)"
1,Damn 1.2 million views in only 10 hours…
1,"genuinely... give me a horse a dog and the means to care for both and I don't need another human to be my friend, I could not see another human in my life and still be perfectly fine."
1,Looking at the responses and new meetups happening on Kurzgesagt Reddit thread is truly amazing. It just shows the world is full of lonely souls waiting to be connected. So let's try to get off our lonely island and meet!!!
1,This channel is basically documentaries now
1,"I would like to know if anyone here have actually made a friend after finishing school or college. I'm really skeptic whether it's possible. I have some good friends from school, but I mean friendships which have already been tested by the hardships of life. 

People these days have this habit of calling ""friend"" people who they spend time together in some way or another, but the first problem they have or you have, you find yourself alone once again, maybe they flirt with your ex, or any trust breaking stuff like that. 

So my question for anyone who might want to respond is:
Have you found a real friend in your adulthood? (but please say yes only if this friendship have already been tested, not if you just trust the person with all your heart, because in this case we have no way to really know)"
1,Today I realised that Kurzgesagt uploads in 60fps
1,I haven't gotten a kurzgesagt video notification in a while and I feel like youtube is calling me out
2,I got caught offguard with that notif lmfao i expected like some random space vid but this is good
2,"Kurzgesagt, is this a personal attack or something? XD"
1,I left my local friends it had been 5 months and then my doorbell rang there they were and were fully worried about me. thats when i learned about the importance of friendship
2,"Finally, a good tutorial."
2,Kurzgesagt never fails to guess what topics I need XD
1,"Sorry for my poor English.
I reached out to some old friends in an attempt to break away from my loneliness. However, I failed to close the social distance with them. Depression and the resulting excessive self-protection make social reintegration a major challenge, and experiences such as the aforementioned turn it into an even bigger problem."
0,I feel attacked by the title lol
1,"I never had a lot of friends but since 2019, life forced me to left my birth country because it was geting imposible to survive there, people there almost don't have access to internet so I lost contact with a lot of them, since I arrived to my new country I've been doing this routine, just going to work and back, I literally don't know anybody here, maybe if I finally move to a bigger city I'll have more luck"
1,"What about when you go places, talk to people regularly, interact with them during that activity, etc. But they never *ever* are interested in doing anything with you outside of that. And I don't mean they don't like you, they will talk to me at the next event, etc. But no one has *ever*, and I mean ever, asked me to hang out with them outside that activity. Literally never.

I don't overshare or anything, or under share. I keep t up for months or years.

Yes I've tried asking them if they want to go somewhere. Again always no..

I'm 28. And at this point I think it's just clear that some reason no   one wants to be my friend."
1,"I've tried to make friends as an adult and I just can't do it. I don't care about real life, only the internet. Every gaming guild I join... kicked. I even became a youtuber for the sole purpose to make friends, and yet I have none. I learned I am simply too far gone to connect with anyone not also as far gone as myself. I have no idea where to look. I've tried every ""bad"" part of the internet to find like minded people, and still no success. Maybe that's just how it's supposed to be."
1,The trick is to find people who arent so closeminded that they only enjoy people with the same opinion as them. You could try telling psychos on Twitter to stop being psychos
1,I got this notification while I was reading about making friends face_with_raised_eyebrow
1,"what's the point. we are all going to die due to climate catastrophe, and that is ok, according to you, no?"
1,This feels oddly targeted at me and i don't like it
1,"It sounds certainly difficult, I may pass on this one."
1,"That's exactly it. I'm kinda tired of people assuming I'm on the aspergers or autistic spectrum because I struggle making friends. Granted I do have some of the symptoms, I have ticks and social anxiety, but honestly I just feel really unluckly. I did have friends at school, but I was admittedly a bit weird and unsociable, I didn't hang out with them much after school or make any attempt to be popular or pursue hobbies outside my home. But then when I did decide to be more outgoing, I realised I really lacked social skills. I can talk to people, I have the confidence to do things myself and approach people, but usually it's a case of the right person, time and place and I feel like an awkward outsider. All my old friends have moved on with their lives, and where I live there's nothing for young people to do. There's few meet up spots, bars or social clubs, and even people I do talk to say it's hard meeting new people and they don't even really go out, they just have house parties with their friends from school or college. I've made some attempts like going out by myself and going to the gym, but nothing's really come of it. I decided to go to uni for further education but also to move to a new city and mingle with like minded people. I made some friends, joined some societies, and lost my virginity, but it still felt like I wasn't really included and accepted, it was always on their terms and people rarely talked to me, I was just kind of... there, and the few people I did have a connection with were always busy, made excuses, or ignored me entirely for no obvious reason. Covid restrictions limited social interactions that wouldve normally happened, I didn't even meet most of my classmates face to face and get to know their names and shake their hands until second year, and even then people's attitudes seemed to change and they didn't want to go out as much or meet new people, and all uni students are into is clubbing, which I hate. I'm introverted and I like a drink, but I much prefer to go to a chilled bar and work my way down the cocktail menu or go visit a museum, hiking or just a cafe than high octane stimulus activities. Now I'm back home and I feel despondent and aimless. I've got a job now, and I'm good at making acquaintances, but can never seem to becoming friends with people, even if we seem to have a connection when we see eachother. It just feels like people don't care about me and if you're not just like they are, or fit or attractive or charismatic, then they're just not interested, even if you show an interest in them and are friendly. I honestly don't know what to do. I might be moving to a nicer area soon where there are woods to explore, country pubs to enjoy a grog, more social activities and job opportunities, which I'm very excited for, but right now I'm desperately lonely"
1,How to: don't have expectations? Or to stop overthinking/ worrying a lot about everything. Any advice?
1,"Ever since high school, i pretty much had my number of friends drop into single digits, around 3ish. Another issue, is that I can't seem to be able to remember people's names and tie them to their faces anymore now. Before, I used to end up knowing everyone's name by the time school ends, around when the current semester/quarter is bout to end. Now, I can't. 

(Theory of mine is that, before high school, I could remember everyone's name because we're all stuck together. Elementary, all stuck in the one same class, middle school, all stuck in the same periods as each other. Come High school, where we're not stuck in the same periods anymore, and there's a new person in each period, and blam.)"
1,"Listen, i don't talk a lot, but making friends is easier than you think, engaging in a small talk can immediately help you feel less lonely"
2,Is the information age making it easier to make friends or harder?
0,i feel personally attacked that i was reccomended this
1,"The reason is because people make friends on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram which in my opinion is a complete waste of time. I remember the days when you would walk around your neighborhood and you’d actually meet people or your parents met someone and they decide to introduced their children to each other."
1,"HAHAHAHAHAHAH tnx this gave me a good laugh, can't believe someone can be this much of a loser that it would warrant making a video for them"
1,"FRIENDS, the ones who are out to use you. And take what's yours. That's my life experience."
1,I give up on making new friends after my ex-friends left me to hang out with a bully. I'd rather be alone and now i just don't like people.
1,"I was just thinking about this today, how since I've moved abroad my old ""friends"" they don't seem to care about me anymore. So I genuinely think I manifested this video, you're welcome guys."
1,"Is it coincidence that The Happiness Lab podcast by Dr. Laurie Santos also just released an episode about ""The Secret to Making Friends as an Adult"" and all about loneliness and its detrimental effects on our health? I would highly recommend everyone to give it a listen! Her most recent episode that was released Sept 5, 2022 :)"
1,I’m waiting for this dude to make an app now that’s just nerds talking about weird science
1,Bit unexpected topic other than science and space but worthy as always Kurzgesagt
1,It shouldn’t be too surprising that Kurzgesagt knows its primary userbase is comprised of Redditors.
1,"jesus christ im starting school tomorrow, just in time, are you watching me through my webcam????"
0,"Nah, I think I'm just going to kill myself"
2,"this one was cinematic,,,,,loved it"
1,"Yeah. Wow, I really feel this. I only have 4 real friends, 2 are my roommates, and we spend a lot of time together, and the other 2, I really only see once a week. I like a small circle of friends, but yeah, I'm still pretty alone, and lonely. It's really hard meeting new people and making new friends these days."
1,holy moly its less than 24 hours and it went from 11k in 10 min then 127k in  24 min to 1.5m damn
1,"I don't think this is the case for the majority of people, but for me, the first problem of friendship is that you don't find someone who's like you. As a teenager, it's pretty hard for me since I'm not like the average teenager's sense of humour, emotions and interest...


Edit : when I say someone like me, it's not an ego thing, it's just that to have close friend, I personally need someone who's close to me on humour, mentality etc... To have great time."
1,"I can't believe the timing man...I began college a month ago in a new city, and I was just asking my friends from hometown on how to make friends."
1,Doing stuff and going places sounds exhausting
1,And I took that personally
1,"as an introvert, i can relate."
1,"i'm so sad, you didn't put italy among the western european countries. :("
1,"The fact that a girl or woman was at the center of the thumbnail speaks volumes about the gynocentric attitude. I generally admire and appreciate your content, but this is a garbage move. Exponentially more males or men suffer from chronic loneliness than women of all people, so painting them as the majorly affected population group is absolutely absurd and reprehensible. It's an affront to the suffering of modern men!"
2,Friends are for weak
1,I'm fully covinced this channel is stalking me
1,"By looking at these comments, it’s great to see a video help and relate to so many people, including myself.
Keep doing what you’re doing Kurzgesagt!
We all truly appreciate it"
1,"By the way, when is it good to ask a acquaintance for their phone to chat with them more or ask a fellow worker to hang out?  Another quick question;  is it okay to ask for someone u just for their number so that way you can chat with them more as friends in the future?"
1,"Kurzgesagt: ""dust off your Space Marines...""
Me: ""he gets it!, HE GETS IT"""
2,Is It wrong of someone has no desire for Friends?
1,"This only works if you aren't furry, if you're a furry you destinated to be hated and ignored the rest of your life.

Believe me, I know it."
1,"I am blessed to have the same friends for the last 15 years of my life. I’m 30 now and over those years I’ve kept friends from Highschool, middle school, and college. Our group has slowly grown and we help each other out, call each other, cry together, laugh and life and love life. I’ve seen some of my friends have children, get married, and go through other life changing events.

We don’t see each other in the past 3 year as often but we talk over the phone, through text everyday. Our brotherhood is one of the most important things in our lives. 

I challenge everyone out there to put in the effort to talk to the people you love. Find out what and who they love, offer your ear to them. Make yourself available for those people, to play games, or to talk, or hangout.

Cheers everyone."
1,The animation though
1,Check check_mark
1,Broooo I’m starting high school today without any friends I need this
1,"loneliness has been hitting me super hard especially the last couple days. Over the summer I decided to take a gap year but just changed my mind now that it's too late and I have to wait for next semester. Even after watching this it really hurts that I just don't have any kind of routine right now where I could develop friendships, nor do I know what I would want to do to try and have an opportunity to meet people."
1,"I'm only 17 and for my whole life, I have always been an introvert. I only had a few friends and the few friends I had, I never hang out with them outside of school ever and I rarely hang out with them in school. But I'm choosing to get married in the future so I hope I could find a women who is also an introvert and doesn't have many friends and can match my personality. I'm an Aries btw."
1,ugly crying
1,"I moved to NYC a year ago and haven't made any new friends and all my college friends are in different states. Even my boyfriend is long distance. It's either impolite or dangerous to even try make eye contact with people in this city. I had multiple friend groups in college, it's so tough to approach people. School was easy for that because I was already in a space where I knew everyone around me was guaranteed to have similar interests in art school."
1,"I'm convinced that my dorm is just cursed because i have barely seen the people the people who live across from me, much less become close friends"
1,"I never knew people felt like this. I have always been alone, but never really felt ""lonely,"" the way it's described here. It's interesting seeing this perspective."
2,"""I don't need friends, they disappoint me.""  LOL!!! face_with_tears_of_joy"
0,"“The worst loneliness is to not be comfortable with yourself.”
― Mark Twain"
2,"Great video, but where are the birds?"
1,"K bro, this is getting too personal"
1,A video that's made for me!
1,This is so well timed...red_heart
1,This video made me feel good more that any other motivational video.
1,"It's also okay to be alone. I've been living alone (only I'd say 2 friends and my parents with whom I communicate regularly) for years, and I've been having a very comfy life, with few surprises. Please, if you watch this video and are about to talk to an introvert to do a good action, don't push them or say things like ""man, this is not a proper way to live"".
Well, this is the path I have chosen, and acknowledging that this is the way I'm built just made things tremendously better."
1,"Sounds archaic. 
I prefer keeping my enemies close.
(They're more fun.)cowboy_hat_face"
1,"Me: I have no friends 
Also me: never answers the phone or replies to texts"
1,I have lost my best friend at the start of the pandemic. He was really the bridge to a whole pool of people that I connected with at the time. But I did not engage with his friends enough to stay in  this social circle beyond his passing. This and my unhealthy media/drug consumption really through me into quite a dark place. At the beginning of this year I started doing fitness and bought myself a bicycle. Even went with it on a week long trip cross country. I highly recommend picking up a sport as it gives you a different state of mind. Especially when you are too much on your phone.
1,"I am not even sure what a ""friend"" is. I know what sitcom friends are, like from that show himym, that is someone you hang out with all the time and can always call. But such relationships are no more real then Santa Claus, it is a lie that parents tell their children to make them feel better. The truth is that friends do not exist, only acquaintances exist."
1,I'm disappointed the subreddit pages are gone. I made a post the day this video came out and got some responses. Last month I sort of forgot about it though and only now remembered and was going to reply to those posts. I didn't realize there was a time limit.
0,"damn, who the fukk of thought of this?"
2,I have watched 2.37 seconds of this video and I have already gained 4 new friends
1,"One thing that I have always stuck to is quality over quantity when it comes to friendships. Having 2 friends that would go out of their way to be there for you is way better than having 20-30 friends who don't know what you're up to. But the question often is how do you actually find this quality? Honestly you can't plan for it - and anyone who says otherwise is talking complete BS. The closest friends are always unplanned, spontaneous and no expectations. 

Ofcourse you can play the old numbers game. The more you socialize, the more chances you have of meeting quality friends, but I understand it can be exhausting. That is why it's really important to follow your interests. For example, I love sports and I found some of my closest friends playing football or studying the same courses. Eventually you'll find people like yourself, I promise. 

It can be a painful process and a lonely time. But honestly, in the periods you feel lonely, its best to focus on yourself. Read a book. Work out. Learn new skills. All these activities will take time away from you feeling lonely. Ultimately, the more free time you have, you'll end up overthinking, having expectations and feeling bad for yourself. Just learn to love yourself and everything will come in good time!"
1,Very uplifting
1,I needed this.  I have needed this for a long time.  Thank you for the reddit experiment.
1,"Wow, I never realized that retaining friends is an actual job that takes time and energy."
0,Didn’t work I’m still lonely :((
1,shoutout to the purple haired girl who’s been going through her character arc since the dissatisfaction video
2,I want a friend to go and eat a meal with  and talk to
1,I think the universe is trying to tell me something
1,"Anyone else feels like listening to Parliament, Bootsy Colllins or Sledgehammer after watching this?"
1,I wrote a paper about how social media will distance people over time back around 2008 and my professor thought I was wrong. Hmmm
1,"The best bff are part of a family member, either siblings, cousin's or distant relatives because they are the one who can help you in times of need. Family is the most important smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes"
1,Seems to me you’re making a lot of assumptions about my life…
1,"My personal dilemma is that I can make friends very easily. I know how to crack an introvert's shell, and I know how to tolerate an extrovert's energy. However, I want to become close friends with specific people I interact with, but I always end up in the acquaintance zone (or whatever the friendzone equivalent for friendship is)."
1,I'm guilty from knowing the fact that it's hard to make new friends from the hit of pandemic. Now I need to take a little step to do something.
1,"Who needs friends? I like being alone and by myself. The friends I do have are on Facebook and I rarely am on social media. I just don't like being around people much anymore. I tolerate them at work and that's about it. Once I'm done, leave me alone. Is it wrong? Maybe. But like the old saying goes 
We're born alone. We live alone. We die alone
I never was the one to make friends or have any relationship. I'm introverted and damn proud of it."

Probably not, but it would be neat."
1,"if you are reading this in 2022 don't blame yourself for not being able to prioritize friendship as much and feeling lonely, in this global economy rn, just surviving is all that most can manage day to day."
1,"Dear Kurzgesagt Crew, 

I have been having trouble retaining friendships, retaining information from school, finding motivation to keep going, and in general my life seems to be spiraling. I feel as if, if I were to go one more year trying to endure the same monotonous, boring, disengaging, stressful mess of information that is school, I would surely snap. I know you all are mainly science and sociology, but I have to ask, and you guys seem to be engaged in your community, but what do I do? How do I steady this spiral? I feel so powerless knowing my life, wether I’m on the streets, or in a mansion, is decided by these classes which I find so horribly dis-interesting. 

Sincerely, someone who thinks it’s a good idea to contact a YouTube channel with millions of subscribers, in the comment section."

2,Why do people struggle with making friends
2,what materials do you make friends out of? friends made out of rocks are kind of stone faced
1,"I had a 'friend' when I was living in Japan,  but for reasons I'll never understand they just decided to ghost everybody when they left.  Of course, I wasn't aware that they ghosted other people and thought it was something I'd done. Spent a while convinced I just wasn't worth it -_-"
1,"First time kurzgesagt didn't convince me, I never found making friends easier when spending time together at school or college, and i really doubt that shared schedules is more important than similar interests. I think most ""friends"" we make the way they said in the beginning of the video are more colleagues than friends, real and more profound connections made way easier when we have similar interests and world views. most of the friendships i made at school just by spending a lot of time together were shallow and to be fair, pretty boring."
1,"Another thing for all of us to practice is to be available and reliable. A lot of times we try and plan things with loose friends we’d like to hang with more and they’re very non-committal, flake out, or just never make free time available.  Pretty tough to be a good friend doing that."
1,what is youtube trying to tell me..
1,"I am the only one in my friend group who hadn’t had a face-to-face class for college. I stay indoors for school and all of them were on their different universities, gaining new friends, having fun with them and forming bond. They now spent a lot of time with them and when we met, things are just not what it seems to be before, they just talk whatever happened on their friend group to me. I don’t know if they even wanna hang out still. I feel like since they have new friends I was never there and they just got to remember me if I’ll reach out. Idk this thoughts could really hurt me to the core"

2, Catan! haha love you guys thanks for the great video! :)
1,my biggest problem is that I want friends and want people to talk to me but whenever someone tries to talk to me and be friendly I cant help but be an asshole and not want to give them  my time of day
1,"when they shut down schools for a year and a half so you and your weed buddies make the next leap to the medicine cabinet out of curiosity & boredom. yeah, it was a fast year and nobody went to online classes after the first couple of months.  misuse of substances ruined literally all relationships so the lonely feeling is all too familiar & anxiety prevents me from talking to new people. I go to the gym every day and have a great physique. I'm just much shyer than I used to be before all that went down in 2020."

1,"I moved to a village last yr and I hardly know anyone here.  A lot of my friends when I was younger have kids and are in relationships, and just getting them to spend time with me feels so hard.   I try to talk to people at social events, rarely do I find people I have anything in common with.  Hoping for new connections to come this yr"
1,"I’m telling you people, bumble bff is amazing"
1,"Thanks for the video, but I just wanted to say that I would appreciate more SCIENCE videos on space, astronomy, human civilisation, positive stuff ... and less sad videos about not having friends, changing life, civilisation collapsing, and how we're all going to die. Cheers <3"
1,"This is a nice effort to shake things up and it's the best you guys can do but really there is no cure for this, this phenomenon of loneliness is driving people crazy, me included. It all depends on what cards you're being dealt with. You have a few chances at making friends in school, high school and university but beyond that it's incredibly rare. If those three fail you will struggle for the rest of your life. It gets worse with relationships. I haven't been able to find a loved one in all the circles I've been in and it's killing me. I hate how in order to satisfy my primal self I have to literally hit up on women to have a chance, I love slowly building up relationships and using shared activities for bonds but nowadays it's just impossible. Modern life is killing our social life. I chased a career my whole life and when I have it I have no will to live because I don't feel in the right space. I just wish we wouldn't be hard wired to meet people, at least let me be at peace when things are hard."

1,"I won't watch this video because the title is condescending and it blames the person who is lonely for not having friends instead of others who may have mistreated you. The title also suggests that Idk how to make friends/be a friend. Well, I know that it's not like that (by blaming the victim). You have a lot to learn about building rapport through mutual respect."
2,I JUST started a college and this was really helpful! Thank you kurzgesagt- perfect timing
1,Delete tiktok. Probably the easiest way
1,Make video about how to stay lonely and prosper.
1,"Now I know why I don't have friends. Because I'm poor, not because they don't  want to be friends with a poor like me, it's just, I don't have the time and money to spend with friends. Spend time with them? I can't! I need work! Share commom activities? What? Washing the  dishes? Bussing tables? Oh what a joy. :("

1,"But what bothers me is that....In school There is good people that I know, but I just don't want to be with them. I socialized with them because I wanted to improve their experience since they were all alone and scattered, near the end of the years I had created a whole group. I did not intend a long term relationship. I want to not be with them. I feel very selfish and lost. I Don't know how to approach this problem. I hope time will figure it out."
1,I love Kurzgesagt not just makes scientific videos but aslo psychological :D
1,"As someone who has always had a very small group of people that I would genuinely call my ""real friends,"" I think the pandemic hit people like me especially hard. I wasn't ever one of the ""popular kids"" in school, but I knew a lot of people and was acquaintances with them because we went to school together for years. I've always been a relatively introverted person and mostly a homebody as well, I'm the type who would much rather enjoy playing video games at home while on discord with my friends than go out to a bar and get pissed drunk on a Friday evening. So it was essentially a double whammy for me, I not only lost all of the shared meeting places such as classes, school events, and just seeing people around campus, I've now been physically and emotionally separated from the people I call my ""real friends"" for a while now too, and it's kinda weighing heavy on me. I went from talking and hanging out with these people on an almost daily basis to nowadays all my friends are pretty significant distances away from me, we've all got school and work and other things to focus on, we rarely even play games together anymore, and our discord calls have gotten more and more infrequent, it's rare for us to talk more than maybe 1 or 2 times a week. It's been weighing on me a lot thinking about the fact that maybe after over 10 years of friendship that maybe me and my friends have just drifted apart. The thought of potentially losing those friends after so long is terrifying, because I've hardly made any genuine connections to new friends in years."

15 years ago there  was a FLGS near school where I could just go after school, and it was free to just enter and play there.
Now a days the wargaming club is two bus away from home and you have to pay to enter."
1,"My girlfriend is suffer from lack of friends, and in fact she tries very very hard.. And she's biggest problem with this, that nobody nearly has a soul deepness like her, and everyone around her has simple, and shallow mind... She looking for ppl to share her deep toughts about the world, and have deep long talks about basicly anything, and everytime she meet one, she get more and more depressed, and dissapointed about the fact, that nobody like to talk about theese kinds of things with girls for example, bcs they are only interested in typical things like drugs, alcohol, and partying all night. She even tried to reach out another guys to make friendship with them, and most of the time it wents well, until all of them suddenly fellt in love with her, and she got even more dissapointed, cuz she knows, that girls arent in these thing, and man only does it to get some girlfriend, or easy hookups... So she decided, to dont give a fuck about it anymore, and focus on me, the human, who gives any of her desire. For example long and deep talks, and everything, what she cannot do with anyone else. So my opinion is, that its isnt that simple, like its seems like... Be carefull ladies, most of the guys dont want friendship, but anything else, and most of the girls arent open for soul deepness. Sad it is, but you can choose to suffer for a whole life, or accept the fact, that you are crazily individual by your deepness and mindset, and most of the ppl simply cant do anything with it."

1,"- You make friends with people around you, who you spend time with (why it's easier to make friends at school/university)
- Proximity is a better indicator of future friendship than similar interests. Being in the same room as somebody creates empathy and connection (even without interaction)
- #1 Principle to making more friends = regularly spending time with people in the real world
- Number of friends isn't important - different numbers are better for different people, and optimal number may change as you get older

- Why do people struggle with making/keeping friends - people don't prioritise it until they realise how important it is to their wellbeing. 
- It falls behind in the priority list behind work and dating, unlike at school.
- Keeping/making friends requires regular investments of time and energy
- In younger people, too much time online instead of in real life can lead to lack of real connections

- Friendships may collapse due to lack of regular investment of time/energy in real life
- They may also collapse due to moving for work/family, or a breakup, or if a node in your network moves away and you lose their connections

- New friendships can develop over a few weeks and become a close relationship after a few months.
- The biggest impediment is time and quality of interactions
- Intentionally meeting people with similar interests/values who are open to new friendships is best
- Understanding yourself is a good start. Pursuing your own interests in a connected environment (volunteering, hiking groups, sports clubs, book clubs etc) will make it more likely you meet similar people.
- Work can be a great place to make friends. Consider the type of work you do and whether you're likely to meet similar people there. You might consider this when choosing a career.
- Deepening a career with colleagues can lead to great friendships, especially when there is no power imbalance.
- You may be able to revive an old friendship with a simple call or meetup. 
- Invitations to events you create can kickstart new friendships.

- How to develop deeper connections = sharing and caring
- Open up about your interests, goals, and thoughts on your own life and the world. Share your experiences and personal life. But don't overshare too quickly. 
- Demonstrate a genuine interest in getting to know your friend and learning about their interests/goals"

1,"damn, I'm extremely introverted, always preffered reading books than talking... now as an adult(26) its quite hard making small talk with others, i usually try talking about Netflix shows as most don't like reading books here in Spain.

I grew up mostly without internet too so... i have a lack of knowledge of old memes, i remember i had to go outside the hospital to steal wifi to send high school works sometimes when I was younger, now i finished university as a computer engineer and a master in Motion Graphics, yeah your high school friends you wont see them again, i managed to keep some university friends thx to my gf being good at socialising, master friends nop, they always invited to drink beer but i hate beer, and i get way too nervous starting conversations, a karaoke would have been better, i love singing.

This is kind of a rant at this point but oh well, saw on Stranger Things from Netflix the Dungeons & Dragons game in Cantabria, it looked fun, at least on the show...thinking_face

1,“Why I need to make more friends” yeah fuck that. I had a friend group of over 30 people in highschool and I went out of my way to get rid of all of but 5 of them. They where nice people but I’m not a ir type of person that wants to talk to people period so I saw no reason to keep them. All they did was inconvenience me “do you want to Hangout” they asked me all the time fuck no I just want to be my by myself something I have a hard time understanding why they don’t get so I did whatever I could to get rid of them. My end goal is to go off grid and talk to no one.

1,it is so easy if it wasnt for my social phobia/anxiety
1,People don't like the intensity of which I take into every activity I engage with. That's why I have no friends. The price I am willing to pay to be good at things.
2,"Thank you, brother. I need this."
1,Well dealt with bullies...never again
2,Because of where I live I am stigmatized in the community so I made friends here where I live and it’s good enough for me and as high functioning as I am at least I don’t have the attitude feeling like I’m better than them.
2,"Quite an idealistic and glorified view on friendship from the very beginning.
- Wrongly implying that life is not bearable or fun without friends.
- Friends is a source of sense of meaning and purpose? What about deciding on meaning and purpose for yourself on your own? No? You are dependent on others for that?



Friends (real) is a social support net construct no more, no less. Of course, you are better off having that. But let's not glorify it, because good friends, just like good marriages, is not attainable by everyone, especially idealized ones like in this video. If you have them, that's good luck, if not - no need to wallow despair, you can do fine without them."
1,anyone in the comments wanna be my friend?
2,I used to have one friend and she basically just ignores me now. I feel like i was tricked into a friendship.
2,"There is a difference between having casual friends and real friends. I think real friends are those who will visit you in the hospital if you are injured and will pro-actively invite you to something to cheer you up when things are tough. Casual friends just can't be bothered. They have their own stuff to do and other priorities. It's very hard and very rare to find real friends, and unfortunately I don't have any, after years of trying to cultivate friendships, they simply crumble too easily."
1,"What about the friendships that always require you to message, call, coordinate stuff - and when you don't do any of those, you don't ever hear from them?"
2,lol nah i love being away from all of you people

Everyone does get lonely from time to time, but when you weigh the options of having to trust again and again  and be hurt over and over, it just becomes easier to be alone."
1,This hits so close to home.. the ending made me tear up
2,"instructions unclear, am now stuck on a ceiling fan and have less friends than what i started with"
1,I am 25 and we use to move a lot when I was a child so I never made any friends. And so far I don't have any best friends or close friends and it seems perfectly fine to me and don't feel the need to socialize too. I guess its okay as long as you don't feel lonely.

It literally has every lesson I've learned in the past year and I'm literally crying because it's affirming that I did things right. I only wish it existed sooner, please if you are in the same position of being alone try your best to take this video to heart, especially when they say not to beat yourself up over it, or compare yourself to others, and be patient; those are honestly the most important three.

I find making friends rather difficult if I'm not approached first, my location also doesn't help considering I'm different from everyone else and my views and opinions are incredibly different from people in my country. So proximity isn't really an option and considering the people with similar views are out of my time zone I just don't seem to be to successful."

1,"Absolutely appreciate the topic of this video, as it has been relevant for many people here, including myself. 
A few years ago I went home for professional pursuits and the entire year built up to the move; I got home and couldn't connect with anyone and didn't feel and couldn't be myself. I ended up having to leave and made my way back to the country where I had been living, but now to a smaller city. Then COVID hit. A combination of the two things (smallness and COVID) left me awfully lonely on the back of a hard year, but even after certain measures were lifted I never could connect with where I was living, it was fine, but I never really made friends, so like two and a half years without having friends by your side. Over the summer I've made a move back to where I was living in the first place and it's been amazing, I've felt more comfortable, I've met more people and been able to try more things. I haven't made friends, per se, with everyone I've met, but just getting back out there and meeting people and having a laugh or whatever has been very refreshing, as I felt at a loss during my time back home, then where I ended up living; like it made me question who I was. 
I look forward to meeting more folks going forward and wish you all well in your own pursuits for friendship and similar too!"

1,A tutorial on how to make friends? Says a lot about society today.
1,"It's worth mentioning that this is why Ghosting is SO harmful to deal with when trying to exit isolation and make a new social contact.

Ghosting provides the other person zero information for improving their chances when attempting socialization again with someone else. Having less control over success or failure generates stress, as stress is inherently just the lack of choice & control over one's own circumstances.

Ghosting not only disconnects the person from their attempt at a social connection, but it also psychologically discourages the investment of time in that activity as a while. It pushes them to need to reduce stress of isolation and rejection by actions OTHER than socializing as a coping mechanism — like scrolling social media. That's why people get trapped in isolation and it gets repeatedly more difficult to exist isolation the more often that occurs, as Ghosting generates a feedback loop that continually makes those actions more difficult and stressful the more it happens.

While it may often seem like an easier option than communicating with someone that might lead to a disagreement, it's just burdening the other person with that stress and becoming blinded to that as a means of causing harm. This is because stress amplifies both aggressive and submissive behaviours, so the two negative responses to Ghosting both give positive reinforcement to using it again, rather than giving a discouragement.

The submissive response drops contact without resistance making Ghosting feel like a safe and amicable option, because the negative impact on the recipient is never seen by the party doing it. The aggressive response makes the other party seem overly hostile to perceived conflict, reinforcing the belief in the necessity to use Ghosting as a form of self-protection.

The person doing the Ghosting gets a positive reinforcement for offloading the anxiety of communication onto the other party, _even if the net effect of those actions is completely negative for the recipient._

Especially as people struggle to find time in busy lives and can forget to reply, it's important to communicate in a way that distinguishes honest forgetfulness from intentionally ignoring someone. The fewer social supports people have, the bigger the impact of that type of stress is, and everyone is most sensitive to it now more than ever after a pandemic and other stressors have been added to all forms of socialization as a baseline. Everybody needs a little extra sympathy and compassion."
2,"Cool, may we all find true friends are described by St. Thomas Aquinas.

God bless, Rev. 21:4"
1,"What about if you are financially trapped in a region or state whose population is the opposite of your sociopolitical makeup? How do you make any but long-distance friends on line? Even if you aren't horribly alienated by where you live,  if you're trying to avoid long covid, repeat damage from covid infections, or being a vector for a vulnerable person who's one of your FEW friends (the closest of my three [long-distance] friends is immune compromised, so I want to make sure she doesn't get infected through me on our rare get-togethers), covid is still a huge roadblock to meeting new people and going among strangers.

Still, even before covid, I was already in a hell of loneliness and alienation, because I am financially trapped (sleep and PTSD disability) in a region where people like me are exceedingly rare. I can't afford to relocate, and therefore cannot afford to change the environment I live in. This video brought tears to my eyes, but did nothing to help resolve my situation, and I suspect that's the case for a lot of people who are, like me, outside the status quo/median of society (whether by ""choice"" or not)."

1,"Having no friends or family hurts so much and is so hard to deal with. I can't even enjoy things for myself anymore. I don't see the point. I've tried to reach out but no one is interested in what I have to offer. I hear people say all the time that there is a community for everyone, and if you want to find friends there is somewhere you can feel welcome. I have not experienced that to be true in my case. This video honestly made me feel worse."
1,"Me Personally, My trauma from failed friendship/relationships has got me to the point where I don't care for social interaction, or to connect with other people. Because 9.95 times out of 10, people only care about what they've got going on & their needs. My favorite is when you call them out on that behavior, or dont feed into how they're  feeling, then they start to feel Upset. And anything pertaining to you at all, is insignificant.."

1,"I like to think I don’t particularly need friends. I go to the movies alone, I don’t enjoy celebrating birthdays (never have), and I’ve never been sad where I needed comfort. I talk to people at work enough for my social interactions I think. Maybe I’m weird idk"
1,"I'm a 27 year old introvert and been trying to make new friends through college, but never happend. Then there is the ""people should not be trusted"" mentality that I have started to believe in, so I just accept my lonely nature for what it is because loneliness is all I got."
1,How did they know
1,"I'm 29 now and all the friends I had have either moved on, or got sucked into the Canadian opiate epidemic and I just had to get away from them. I definitely get lonely sometimes, but other times I kind of enjoy it. I'm sure if I wasn't a heavily introverted personality then it would most certainly be more difficult. I'd probably have an easier time making friends too."

1,"One thing that was repeatedly mentioned throughout this video is that the best way to maintain friendships / make new friendships is to hang out with people in real life.
However, most of my 'closest' friends are people who live very far away from me, people I met over the internet who play video games.

So, I have to wonder, how important is meeting people in real life anyway?"

1,"As someone who has not gone to college and started an early career as a programmer I have struggled a lot with lack of friends. But the most challenging aspect was definitely dealing with people's egos.

2,"Thank you, I just gained confidence :)"
1,I’ve been stuck in a toxic situation for years and want friends so badly but it feels like no one wants to know. Maybe it’s because of my autism. I can’t even make friends online though…maybe it’s just me.

2,This video was Amazingly helpful! ngl I have zero friends lol
1,"Nobody will see this comment, so I'll use this to vent a bit.

I wish I had close irl friends. I genuinely think I'm a pretty interesting person, it just feels like I have no opportunity to meet anyone. I honestly feel like an outcast just because I want to make friends. Everyone else feels so closed off and dry. I have a friend group from high school that I'm still in contact with, but none of them click for me. When we hang out irl we all get along, but I just wish I could hang out with people I actually feel connected to? Two of them are dating and mainly care about themselves, one is my ex who I dont click with anymore but can still hang around, and the others I just dont think a closer relationship would work. It's hard to explain 

I have one online best friend. They are everything to me and are the reason I'm still pushing through life. I met them when I had nobody close irl or online, so they definitely fill an emotional gap for me. Unfortunately they live across the globe and I'll never get to meet them. I need irl connection badly.

I go to college, but unfortunately my major is held in a tiny building separated from the main campus down the street. I only have classes for 3 hours on Monday and Tuesday, with a low amount of people in them. My pool is very limited, and everyone there just doesn't seem very approachable.

One time last semester I did walk up to someone since they were talking about a game I really liked, and we exchanged discords. Turns out this person was very self centered and was only interested in convos if it revolved around them, so I had to drop them.  Other people have tried to intiate friendships with me (online of course, I don't know them irl) but when this happens I never feel like our personalities click. Or they're only interested in talking about themself. Eventually I have to leave them on read and I feel really bad for it, but I'd rather not give them something fake

I'm just, tired and don't feel like trying anymore"

And it has engraved in my brain that nobody cares about me and I'm cursed to forever drift across the darkness of the void without the warmth of having someone to talk to."
1,"You guys failed to realize the biggest and the only real problem - urban planning. It is the biggest hindrance to socializing, cities designed for cars not people. Everyone is forcibly stuck in their own anti-social bubble called cars, because the government and planners decided being on foot and mingling with others is not on their agenda.

Shifting blame on individual for not going out isn't going to help though."

1,"This will likely get lost in the comments, but here's what I did post-university (graduated in 2001): Left my country entirely. I'd saved up enough and found a job abroad. Being forced to make friends/connections is a great motivator -- and, especially because foreigners stand out to other foreigners, those connections become a little easier. 

It's definitely NOT for everyone, but if you think you might be able to handle it, I say give it a shot."

1,"This video is really helpful but i found myself saying ""but i can't do that"", and a lot of that is due to my disabilities. Does this mean i can't be a good friend? Because I'm not always able to show care the same way others do and not always able to do shared activities due to inaccessibility or just general disabled chronic illness getting in the way"
1,How did Kurzgesagt know that I just got back to college?
1,"I got backstabbed by the only two friends I had in my teens and that was it for me, I never made any new friends.

They went off with their party-animal friends and left me behind who would die for them.

I remember towards the end of the relationship they just refused to hang out all the time, Like I used to see them everyday, then  every 3 days, then a week, then two weeks.. 3 weeks.. then months past they just kept refusing and saying that they were too busy.


I used to live a life where I was outside every single day, and there was nothing more I enjoyed than being with my friends outside and spending time together, Even if we had no money..

Now I am so introverted I hate going outside and I hate talking to people, I prefer to live in isolation.. It has been 12 years afterall, And they forced me into isolation by leaving me behind..

I saw they showed their true selves online, And in real life they just kept up some fake image with me.

Since then I never made real friends again.

I just freeze when someone talks to me with my extreme social anxiety, I am someone completely different to before.. Entirely different.

I never talk to people myself too. I can't even order things at a restaurant or take phonecalls."

1,I am incredibly lonely and doing my first therapy session today
1,"I’ve found that the first two weeks of school are the best times to make new friends. 

Everybody in class is just as out of place and wanting to belong as you. Most people are on their phone so they can mentally be somewhere more comfortable. Stepping just a tiny bit out of your comfort zone to ask a question or say hello to someone early on (before habits of where people sit and who they interact with are set) will go a very long way to making lots of new friends. 

Not too sure about making friends as an adult though. I just stayed in touch with the people I wanted from school."

1,"Thank you Kurz, now I have enough peoples for my death tournament."
1,"As with any extravert (or a successful introvert), kgs seems to think people are lonely because they don't know what thing to do is the right thing. It's wrong. People aren't all stupid, and most of them know perfectly well what they should do to get what they want. What they don't know is _how_ to do it. For example, what good is a ""conversation started"" when you don't know how to formulate an invitation? How do you ""reach out"" when you literally have no idea how to have a casual conversation? If you just ""go with the flow"" like all charismatic people suggest, you get nowhere, because there's no flow for you. Best case, you're somewhat useful to people with similar interests. What specific words do you have to say to incite the transformation of usefulness into interest? How you do compose a phrase the right way? What even _is_ the right way to compose a phrase?

Asking for a friend.

1,"I may feel very lonely and in need of social interactions a lot more than I like but when it comes down to making that step, it's difficult. I've been away from basically everyone for so long that mustering the motivation to simply stay in contact with an acquaintance who could become a friend is hard. Each year, the energy to befriend someone becomes less and less yet my need for one becomes greater. This video helped a little, but it sadly did not help with this problem. I just don't know how to stay motivated anymore confused_face"
2,I’m 14 and I’ve lost touch of my old school friends. I have new friends from my new school but it doesn’t feel the same as when I was with them. I used to genuinely laugh and enjoy myself but now I feel like I’m laughing because I have to go make them feel happy
1,"It's difficult because I am social, but I'm aplatonic so I don't get the feedback I need with ""friends"", but I get lonely really bad. I find D&D helps because I get excited by that, but I still have difficulty feeling like I'm friends with anyone in the group."
1,sad this got over a third of a million views in just 3 hours
1,"What about the issue for people who have all the time in the world, but no one to share it with. Asking for a…"
1,Me: Clicks in a notification with light speed beacuse i want to have friends.
1,"I've tried so hard to make friends or keep my friendship alive but usually I end up with toxic people who are usually there when I'm able to provide them With something in return for their ""friendship"" and the ones that are not toxic aren't my ""kind"" (hobbies, humour) I feel so lonely and depressed I can't anymore"
1,"I have no friends, and am just waiting for the end.  I still watched the video though."
2,recommended
1,i think this is probably kurzgesagt's best initiative so far to push people to make friends!
2,Your best friend is yourself.
1,"My problem is that I get no joy from activities, I've tried bowling, pool, painting, drawing I've been to parties 
I have no hobbies. I have a hard time making freinds because I don't go places."
1,Is it me or did this hit a little too hard...
1,"my college just started and i had no friends due to which i was all alone at a new place
but as per your advice  and a few more things which i did to improve my self confidence
like i gave time to my classmates and hanged out with them, did running , grooming  and learn more about a
how to converse to people
 and in just 1 week i have made three friends
i cannot believe it as my whole life i had been an introvert with just 2 friends  from 7-8 years and it took me just one week to improve it
i am feeling more confident and happy now
thank you again kurzgesagt teamslightly_smiling_faceorange_heart"
2,Why is this recommended to me
1,I mean how does one socialize when the built environment is doing everything in its power to stop you.
1,"Just after lockdown, I literally dusted off my space marines, found a hobby store, and made some new friends. It totally works beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes"
1,Why did this video make me cry?
1,*you guys just changed how I see life*
1,"loneliness has been my fav track of all the ones I've heard on this channel, took me barely a few seconds to recognize it"
1,"Guys, you guys created an amazing social constellation here on Internet, connecting people from so many parts of the world to openly talk about science or loneliness. I feel thankful to find this kind of content free on Internet. Cheers! sparkles"
1,I was expecting instructions on how to build a friend... no blueprints or materials lists or anything. :D
1,"Im at a very lonly point in my life. 9 Months ago i split from my partner, lost my friend group, job and co-worker connections. Ive never had a constant in my life and feel lost. This video has helped in giving me direction. Thankyou"
1,Kurzgesagt really know what's up
2,literally perfect timing more me
1,didnt think an educational youtube channel could roast me like that
1,"Ngl some of this isn’t particularly accurate, being quiet doesn’t make people pity you they just don’t bother"
1,"Get a small group of close friends, not a large group of shallow acquaintances."
2,"Hope my friend doesn't read this
please no"
1,i can't believe it took me 9 months to watch this
1,"this channel helps a lot of people like me, who feel quite lonely too, and it's kind of discouraging when you feel that, only you care about relationships yourself, can seem selfish think so, but unfortunately I don't have anyone I can count on currently and I hope things get better for everyone :) (I don't speak English this comment is translated sorry for any mistakes)"
1,"Me trying to catch friends

1,"I’m moving to a new city for a new job and I was absolutely terrified over being alone. Especially since I’m the youngest by far at my job. I dunno, I’m always afraid that going to clubs or meetups won’t find me the people I want because those people already have friends"
1,Lot of pathetic people in the comments
1,Sucks when all your homies starting families and stuff
2,Anyone in Singapore want to be friends?
1,"i relate to the aspect that is not caring as much as you get older. a big eye-opener was working at a large aerospace company this summer: i was living in luxury and worked hard, so i’d get home to my own place after waking up at 4:30am every day and simply wanted to rest and ft my partner. i didn’t have the energy or need to talk to people around me, and i was happy without them—socializing during the day at work was just too exhausting to keep at it with other people afterward, not to mention going to sleep early. i did, however, make some of my best friendships w people who i am in class with of work alongside in my student org, and i’m at the point where i’m used to not seeing my closest people for months on end, until i’m back in my hometown"
1,"It sucks when you wanna talk, but nobody wants to talk to you"
1, yeah... relly easy to do when you need to work shifts...
2,"Friends, how many of us have them"
1,“Friends” are useless they’ll just leave you after a year of using you as their personal wallet
2,"Thanks Kurzgesagt!
As a person, who has very few friends, I appreciate it a Lot."
1, thats so Me...
1,THIS IS A OVERCOMPLICATED WAY TO SAY THAT YOU ARE LONELY
2,I wish I had friends lol

0,Why does this feel like an insult but isn’t
1,I think the fact that watching this video makes me a little bit emotional is a signal I need therapy
2,"We want to be part of your friendship journey, so we’ve created a few things you can share with new and old friends: https://kgs.link/shop-166"

1,Watching this right after sending a message to my sister who I don’t have the best relationship with. This was very encouraging to watch!
2,"My problem is too few dollars, not too few friends. Anyone care to help me out with that problem?"
1,Woke up and didn't knew Kurzgesagt was gonna do personal attacks today
1,Keep doing what you do..... I really like it thumbs_up_light_skin_tonesmiling_face_with_hearts
2,"A friend among foes, a foe among friends"
1,Whats worse than this is targeted to me is that it isnt. Its just such a massive problem.
2,Love the mighty ducks Easter egg
1,I think people's loneliness is even more a struggle against compulsively viewing their misfortune as a natural cause of life experiences than a lack of ability to make friends.
1,im starting uni in 4 days and this makes me really less anxious
1,"Oh o

I do all the right things to make friends but I still hate everyone

1,"Bro, I realized the only reason I had friends was because I enjoy sharing something in common with them, which was skateboarding, outside of that, there was nothing to communicate about."
0,so much doom and gloom from this page recently. byyyyee
1,I too have been lonely and somewhat depressed for some time. I just can’t really pinpoint what’s making me feel all sorts of emotions. Currently I’m not doing well. There’s just a lot going on in my mind that’s bothering me.
1,"I can say that this guide it's very good and i say it as a person that can be called ""social butterfly""( and for highly sensitive person is somewhat high achievement)
It's very good not just for finding friends but love in some ways too and i could learn something from it so thank you for this video,it was probably very time consuming and had hours of research so i wanted to say thank you for every animator to person writing script because sometimes people forget how much people work for making our life more pleasant"
1,"""Do not cut off (mutual relations)."" ~ Sahih Muslim 45/28"
1,"I'm sitting here alone watching this recalling all of the hard effort I put into friendships only to have been taken for granted and put aside by 'friends' when better things came up for them.  One such 'friend' would do that and then be upset when I wasn't receptive to their half-hearted invitation, having not seen them for months, and chilling out at home, after doing physical work all work, was better for me.  Had they called the day before and asked if I fancied going out I'd have went to bed earlier and prepped myself mentally.  But nope, I had friends who'd drop in and drop out when it suited them and be bent out of shape for not being at their beck and call!

1,"Im an introvert and making friends is much harder than defusing a bomb
This video really helps me how to conquer my fear of making new friends and its a great timing since im about to enter college"
1,This might be considered a shameless plug but I made a podcast talking about IRL and online friends and how there is no difference between those two since your online friends will become your IRL friends on the future.
0,I don't want to make friends I just want to deal with difficult people at work and go home
1,Why was this recommended to me after getting off the phone with my girlfriend?
1,We held a meetup in our local area and had loads of fun and met a lot of cool people. Thanks for setting this up. <3
1,"Good news for everybody and suggest others to do same (i wasnt watch video yet) - setup tinder and inform clearly and without doubts that you looking for friends, add pictures that shows your hobby or stuff that you enjoy to do. In 2 months I already made some great friendships - something that I  try manage in past 7 years"
1,how did he know i dont have frinds : (
1,I’ve never had someone I can truly open up to. I don’t want to trauma dump or ramble… but I hope that changes.

1,Right at the start of a new semester after the last was awful for me. Perfect timing
1,Got hyped by the 40k reference lol. But then got even more hyped about the meetup subreddit. I feel like this video was directly made for me. Been struggling with this lately. I thought this was an incredible video and super helpful. Thank you guys.
1,Alonso needs this desperately
1,Bro really had to make a video on how to make friends
2,I'll be your friend : )

2,"Man, I love Kurzgesagt videos about social/society problems."
1,"I get that Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell really wants people to get out there and make friends. However, Kurzgesagt forgot some bitter truths about humanity. They put getting out there and making friends up against - jealousy, envy, greed, and the need to simply h8te and the toxicity of the culture in which those individuals who go to school or work together are in and what those cultures PROMOTE within the even smaller circles within the larger school/work environment. Thus, leaving a lot of people in the comments section to be like well....who needs friends. There is a high toll and/or cost to maintaining those relationships which you won't say are beneficial or not. They won't always be reciprocated. So with making friends you are usually up against environment*lack of (this or that) in a society that PROMOTES (a social norm ) that may be toxic to garnering new friends. Thus, one winds up with making more colleagues and people to chat with, but not anyone that they truly truly truly went through the rough with. Those people would be the 1 friend or 2 friends who became friends after a long long long long long time at least more than 10 years. But there are always issues in tribes of trust(which one needs in order to make a person a friend). Most humans don't have it. Children do far more, but adults lose all trust. Soooooo most people create families as a sure way to have ""friends"" because why? They created them with another human being and built out from there. Beyond that most people don't have friends is right."
1,At 57 I have few friends. My wife has passed and my kids are grown. I sit in a corner of a pub and await death.

2,Lmao wtf is a frien
1,One only needs to be lonely a few times to quickly realize the difference between being alone and being lonely.
1,Just moved to a whole new city for college and this popped up
1,I hope to learn something here today... could really use it...

1,Every Kurzgesagt title sounds so passive-aggressive.
1,"How to make friends? Come on men, i am not going to waste my time."
1,"I'm lonely as hell. I used to have so many friends and was so social. Ever since the pandemic and at the same time I broke up with my ex,  I just changed and became more isolated. Everyday it's just me. I might talk to a family member every other day or so. But at night, after I go home it's just me... pensive_face"
1,That's you I really needed this becuase recently bad stuff was happening to me and this helped me alot
2,"This video was super helpful to my life at the moment, hope I'm not the only one."
1,We live in a society.
1,"I won't go into detail, but suffice to say this video showed up right when I needed it. Last night was particularly rough for me and it's easy to feel like you're the only one experiencing the isolation when you are in it. But just taking a quick look at the comments already posted here I see that it's not just me, and now I feel motivated to go out and find some of these potential friends. Thanks Kurzgesagt."
1,im an int5roverrt and i likek spicy food this video is wrong i demand you make an amendment tht says i specifically am introverted and prefer spicey food pls n thank u
1,"I lost my closest pet, with whom I shared 18 years of life, food, time, seats and blankets, 2 days ago. Some people said ""I'm sorry"", some even were bold / cold enough to say ""I can't help you with that"" and my relatives don't even bother keeping me company while I'm sobbing my eyeballs and heart out. My throat even ached like I had a cold from all I cried yesterday. All I wanted was someone to tell me it's gonna be okay, or hand me another roll of TP to brush away my snot, that my baby is happy beyond the rainbow bridge, that life is still worth living. I can do all of that on my own, but it's much harder when I can barely breathe or think. I have never felt so lonely in my life. I'm no one's priority, not even my own parents's, just because I'm single and an adult, thus should be able to stand on my own. It's mind-blowing how people in a similar situation to mine can feel this lonely with 8 billion people in the world."
0,I hate people
1,"If you feel lonely and without friends:
1) Get offline and go out and join in real world activities.
That's it.  There's only one step, but it requires cutting the online addiction."

""They were just really really good friends"" -Some historian, probably"
1,"As an introvert, I don't have any issue engaging with people in a social environment, but I just prefer smaller group in a quiet environment for quality time. I'm not a big fan of clubs, bars, concerts or any of those other events that are crowded with people because they're too loud to me. I prefer having one-on-one conversation so I can focus on one person at a time, instead of trying to give everyone the same attention and focus, which can be exhausting overtime. 

On the side note, playing games online is an easy way to make friends. Since I don't really like to go out to social environment, I have met a lot of friends over online games that we have talked and played together, especially if you play a MMORPG type of game such as FFXIV, because the FFXIV community for the most part are very nice and welcoming people. It's easy to engage in those conversations because you do dungeons and raids and share the same story experience together, and they're just there to support you through your experience that they once had. It's also very easy to make friends online since there's no expectation or any pressure. You just ask them if they want to party and play and that's it or vice-versa. Or if you get stuck in a certain part of the game, you can always ask them for help and that's a very good way to start a conversation that can lead to a friendship later on. I have met a lot of friends because of this reason, and I am very grateful because I have met these wonderful people online through a game."

It's hard to think about it but you never really know when you need something until it comes to you.

And it impacted me... and is impacting others.

2,This is so great!  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you...

1,Damn… Kurzgesat seems to really know it’s audience
1,tldr don't be an introvert lmao le sigh
1,"As someone who has struggled with this, I can tell you that it gets better. One of the things I did to get back into social situations after the pandemic was to literally make a list of all the things I should do. I started with “text a friend” then “call a friend” then “ask a friend if they want to go bowling” all the way to a point where things perpetuated themselves and I no longer needed the checklist. The biggest advice I can give to people is that the biggest mistake you can make when getting to know people is to not even try, so try it for a while and see what it does for your life."
1,""" . . . The worst they can say is ""no"", which will sting for a few hours . . . ""

1,never will happen. i will be friendless for life.
1,"Dear person reading comment section, I wanna emphasize something in the video!  Developing *a large array* interests and hobbies helped me a lot.  In college, I could listen to someone for about 30 minutes before I've got a strong connection to some hobby or another.  Art!  Composing!  Writing!  Video Games!  Movies!  Computer Science!  Dungeons & Dragons!  Politics and philosophy, even! I'm not particularly focused in any one hobby, and enjoy them moderately.  But, this is much better for making friends imo, since I'm not hoping I get that one friend who's a perfect match for a single hobby I enjoy alot.  I'm not saying to give up a hobby you're in love with, just branch out more!  

In addition, don't look to friends as a replacement for self-esteem or a substitute for happiness - though it does help!"
1,"This was such a needed push to talk to people. For me, just hearing 'get out there and make friends' does nothing. So the reddit posts and forums, along with actual ideas, really helped!"
1,"me thinking i finally escaped being a outsider
my youtube algorithm:"
2,Jokes on you I love the alone time. To much drama and fake people out there.
1,"I had a lot of friends from my school and college. I use to really care for them and was available for help anytime they call up. But one day I tried an experiment and quit my every social media platforms and decommissioned my phone number and stopped making contacts with anyone, and made a totally cut off from everyone of them, but didn't changed my residence. Now it's been 5 years running, none of them even cared to find out what happened to me, why am not seen irl or in social media. I'm happy, I did the right thing. It's better to be alone than with the people pretending to be your friends."
1,"I have friends man, but they are all my teachers who are twice my age. Being more mature for my age, having autism, and an introvert by nature, it is near impossible to be good friends with anyone my own age. 


Personality really matters SO MUCH, and I feel like maturity is the hardest thing to find in common with people."
1,"Correction, our relationships were not hit by the pandemic, for the virus didn't lock us up in our homes, but the excessive and tyrannical measures did. But hey, at least grandma lived 3 more months on average."
1,thank you so much for making this video
1,I think I need to put my mic in more when I’m gaming.
1,I was really sad over the news I got today and this video dropped. This is just the best thing ever
1,"Interesting that so many people seem to have a problem with that. I havn't really left my house in months and don't have a great lot of friends, but I don't need many. A handful of true one's is plenty."
0, damn why you have to hit me with that so fast?
0,“Take a look at yourself” well now I’m more sad
1,"Another video meant to provide advice that cause a profound existential crisis. I'm not finishing this, I can't take it anymore, the worst part is when he said that people prioritize romance over friendship, it means that nobody prioritized me. Human beings are truly shitty creatures."
1,Shit @  I feel this on one of those gacha games. Fxck you FGO.
2,How many of use have them… friends
1,"I've always been the ""weird kid"" becuase i was never into trendy things in my country like soccer and gymnastics. I enjoy spending my time behind my computer screen with stranger online because they treat me better than my classmates. I'm in 2nd year of high school and have no real friends. I don't try to make any and they dont be mine."
1,Noice DND shout out!
2,Friends Overrated rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
1," whatever study that is, is territory wrong. I don't speak at all and people are the furthest thing from sympathetic to me. They get offended/butthurt over me being private and shy. Like how dare I for being an introvert."
1,"I don't feel lonely necessarily. Even when I really have just one friend in school. I don't know people. People know me. I was that kid with green hair, that kid who activated a fire extinguisher, spent a lot of time riding freeskates on the street and teaching strangers how to ride them. Now I'm that guy who has a really long hair and doesn't say much and sits alone in class. I'm the one who likes math and chemistry. I'm the one who never talks to anyone except to teachers just so i don't get bored during class (I'm used to asking some questions). And yet I'm perfectly happy with how i am. It's not sad."
0,and who the hell said i’m lonely?
1,avoid uni to get friends that's my advice
1,"I have too many friends, I want to spend a weekend at home and I can't"
1,I wish I could follow this advice but I'll never manage lol. No way I'm good enough
1,"I've never actually had a friend group, or much friends at all in general. I still don't. I only have my close friend who's stuck with me since I met her, back in freshman year. She's always been with me through everything and that's something I'm incredibly grateful for. I've never really found myself looking for other friends or anything, I've been incredibly content with having her in my life and I haven't felt lonely knowing that she cares for me and I care for her. Even if we aren't with each other at the moment.

Don't think that you need to have more friends or people in your life if you are already content with who you have dear to you. If you are happy with having many friends in your social life, that's great! If you are content with only having one or two friends, that's great too! It was briefly mentioned in the video, but there is no need to compare yourself to others. There is no goal or standard to reach. Whatever you are content with in life."
1,I feel very bad for people saying they suffer from loneliness. I've been an extrovert my entire life and to see people scared to even talk to others is purely terifying to me. I wish you guys the best!
0,The fact that this was in my recommendations is depressing
1,Thanks for posting this. It's _exactly_ the video I needed to see right now.
2,"I have no friends in class :( 

But I have online friend but I feel lonely..."
1,Im mostly lonely..
1,"Something that i felt left untouched upon is self improvement. People like others that are actively improving, whether that be mentally,  a hobby, or health. It can also become a shared new experience in which a common goal can keep people inspired to continue striving for it. The point being pushing yourself can become a mutual event to strengthen bonds or even create them."
1,"Life hasn't treated me the best, so unfortunately it's inherently impossible for me to make friends now, because I cannot trust others. I have none.

But I hope many find their way with what this video shares, because falling on this hole is not a good experience, and changes you forever. Make noise, let others know you are there. You can be happy, and make others happy.

Thank you, Kurzgesagt, for making the world a better place, or at the very least, striving for it one grain of sand at a time. Kudos."
1,My recommended targeting me a little too much
1,"Thank you Kurzgesagt for this video. I lost touch with a lot of my friends since the pandemic began. People I thought would be life long friends, all because there wasn't enough physical social interaction and ever since then I have dealt with anxiety, depression and loneliness. This was an unexpected video but glad you shining more light on this topic."
1,"I have plenty of freinds, maybe even too much, but dam that video was still pretty informative!"
1,"too many people, not enough ducks"
1,"Currently in a dorm and the first 3 minutes of this video made me wanna cry because it's literally the opposite of my experience, sure I'm an international student but only one country south. If only it WERE that simple."
1,My problem with finding/having friends is that most of the people I have contact with most days I do not have anything in common with them. I love playing video games and being a 28 year old father it's kind of hard to find anyone who is like that. I dont watch sports and I do not like to drink alcohol. Having a child with a second one on the way makes my personal time even more stretched. I've tried to make friends with other parents and it normally doesn't work out. I would like to have to friends that play the video games I play but trying to find someone who is able to play around my schedule is really hard. The last people I considered friends were only friends with me because they wanted to get at my wife. Right now my only friends are my wife and my daughter.
1,"Dear Kurzgesagt:
Please stop calling me out on such a personal level.

And well, this video came to my life just right"
1,"I have graduated from school and haven't really been a friend with someone, I wish I can make friends when I will study in the university.
I hate being alone all the time.."
1,"Never expected a Kuzgesagt video to make me cry, but here I am."
1,"This channel is a foundation for a better future, an treasure for society"
1,Is this addressed to the andrew tate fandom?
1,"I can’t dedicate the time.

I don’t really like doing a lot of stuff. I prefer intellectual conversation, and as polite as I can put it, it’s not exactly easy to find someone able and willing."
1," This reminds me of that Coke bottlecap social thing, there are two different bottlecaps and you need to connect them together to open the drink. That will be the perfect drink for the Kurzgesagt meetup I think."
1,Way to call everyone out
1, lies nobody wanted to be around me.
2,nice timing..:(
1,I look up ONE Radiohead song and this is what I get suggested…
1,maintaining a friendship has so much more energy needed for initiation
1,"Nice timing publishing this video at the start of the new academic year! 
Thanks for another cool video :)"
1,Me : I already know bro no need to tell me again.
1,"Video has 200k plus views for being posted less than an hour ago, just shows how many people are affected."
1,Need subtitle Indonesia
1,The animation in this one was on a new level
2,Does anyone wana be my friend ?
1,im not tho :-)
1,"Lol I wish it was that simple as to just reaching out. I'm constantly checking in with my (long term) friends, invite them or ask them for a meet up, but all I get is rejection and cheap excuses to a point where I've become tired of always being the one putting in the work. I feel like I have given friends too much priority in life to a point where I've worn myself out and now I feel I'm better off without them."
2,Thanks to this I now got friends.
1,Making friends in an era where each one of struggles and begging for money? The lolwut ...

1,"Since megafauna exctincted, you can't really feel real friendship"
1,"Lets get real, there is no such a thing called ""friend"" or ""friendship"" at this point of time, but rivallary and clash of interests which even torn apart families with strong bonds. As someone said, If you want a friend, get a pet."
1,Why should we make friends in this current toxic society.?
1,"I have a one year old kid, have been a nomad for a decade, and have maybe one proper friend in my city.  Having the responsibility of a one year old daughter doesn't help this, but mainly there is a person in my life who are actively trying to limit my time with companions."
1,Damn I didn’t know kurz was spying on me
1,"Yoo, where's my fellow introverts with an extroverted sense of taste? Lol."
1,"Damn, I'm such a loser, even YT's algorithm's roasting me."

1,"Social media really is poison. The most socially connected generation ever, is also the most lonely generation ever."
1,I was struggling with this and then kurzgesagt come in clutch
2,"This low key has been the greatest video ever. What I’m truly struggling right now is this, despite having a great friend networks as a child. This is just the perfect emotional check. Laying this video out will help more people then any other. Thank you"
2,why this video is so relatable XD
1,I am lonely because the political agenda wanted me to be...
2,Im lonely i need friend. Do u want to be my friend?
1,*Ahh just what I needed*
1,"Purple hair gal is my favorite reoccurring ""in a nutshell"" character"
1,"finally, i can be no longer a rando"
1,im 25 soon and i havent had any friends in years. i wouldnt wish the feeling of loneliness and failure like i do. i know i made my family embarrassed for the fact i cant be normal like everyone else and be worthy of having friends. things are getting more tough for me and i know it would be easier if i had friends but no one ever wants to be my friend. ive tried everything to be liked/ even tried hardly anything. i just want to be myself and feel like people want me around too
2,Perfect time to watch this.
2,Want to be friends? I think I really need some. -_-
2,"Subtle recommendation, YouTube."
2,no friends = shorter life? maybe that's a good thing...

2,"Ok wow, There's no need for that"
2,"Your video made me reach out to  friends I haven't talked in a while and it made us feel so good ! I'm naturally anxious and really introverted so I don't seek attention or going out but it's always good having extra good company and it makes you feel loved and cared ! 

from now on I'll try to be a better friend, thank you as always smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes"
1,This is going to impact a lot of people’s lives in positive ways!
1,Damn my YouTube recommended trying to tell me something
1,"I should have been shown this when i was younger because growing up with autism made it hard to socialize and put myself out there, and i was so self centered and against how other people lived their lives i wasnt even aware of how important friends are for me back then,now and the future"
0,I feel attacked face_screaming_in_fear
2,Perfect
2,"It's not about making friends, it's about making good friends"
2,Have friends they said. It'll be fun they said.
1,"No friendship ever seems sincere to me. It might have to do with the fact that whenever I finally established friendships, my parents found it perfect timing to move far away from what I accomplished after years of struggling to make friends.
To me, it had made clear I am not allowed friends. The few I have I consider associates at best. I simply cannot register their extremely rare occasional selflessness as sincere.
In fact, even my own family I cannot sense any sincerity or selfless interest. They were never around, always at work, always at school, always at sports, never any memorable family moments to speak of. Only when there is an emergency do they drop whatever they do to make time and effort for me. It's not friend or family anymore, it's just a function. Perhaps it is ungrateful of me to feel abandoned after 30 years of trying. Perhaps I have been the one abandoning myself lately. All that time and effort, for anyone else, yet never a return, not sincerely."
1,"i have no close friends a few acquaintances perhaps that i keep a distance with. i care about people and mostly i am open about stuff but when it's obvious that others don't do the same it's frustrating. it gets worse when everyone feels so odd and you end up as this weird mess that stands out in a not nice way. am i just straight up overwhelmingly weird or did i somehow find myself in a community that it polar opposite of me? i have no idea. i try to be upfront about these although it drains me like open throttle bugatti engine because i know people won't do that and i am willing to take the low end of the stick if it helps a bit. yeah um it doesn't it turns out.
i tried a lot because i know i am not good at this. at least people around me are no good either (i don't mean socially, i just don't like them). i value being open minded a lot and i won't change my values that i care about because of some people but i also will not activately push myself out of my comfort zone just for sub-mediocre acquaintances. i just ride my bike, do sports that don't require more than one person because not even a single soul cares about such thing and just do my stuff."
1,"Oversharing is my problem. I'm a very open, honest person and have been told on too many occasions i share to much or that they didn't ask, etc, etc. I was never one to have friends as a kid and when i left school i didn't keep any of my old friends. Growing up in my early 20's i was absolutly fine not having friends and prefered my own company. I'm now going into my 30's and feeling i want more friends. I have tried reaching out online but it hasn't worked, So now i'm at a point where i'd like to try and make some friends but i'm also okay if i don't. I think i need to check out some local events, see if that has more success than online. Fingers crossed"
1,I used to have some friends but I lost most of them along the way. And the reason is that I can't be the only one making an effort in a relationship. I want the other person to do the same. But they just never reciprocated. And now I am at this point where I actually don't even meet new people anymore due to working remotely and being too introverted to start going to places for the purpose of making friends.
1,I am lonely not because I cant make friends I am lonely because I decided to be alone. And I feel lucky to be alone it increases your thought process and you'll be stay focused on your goals.
1,Nah mate dis bullshit I bond over meeting people with the same conditions as me.automatic bestays
1,this ad had some good points ngl
1,"Actual guide to make friends (specially if you're between 12-20)
Don't be yourself, be what others expect you to be, try mirroring their personality and interests even if it means lying to them and to yourself about who you truly are.
Don't try being friends with people that have an easy social life and a stablished group of friends it never pays off.
Sometimes being alone is just better people are too annoying and complicated."

1,"This made me so sad but so happy too. I was really going through a tough time over the weekend, but I found new purpose and I started subconsciously accepting invites and having more fun with people. It’s liberating, and it’s also scary, but so much fun too"
1,"funnily enough, I rekindled a friendship with a guy I haven't spoken to 3 years after we graduated high school. When we hung out it was like the vibe between us hasn't changed. The timing on these videos are always on point. Keep up the great work my bird overlord. I been loving the content since middle school <3"
1,Thank you for talking about topics like loneliness and how to overcome it. It's not talked about ebough even though tgere is a huge amount of people who are suffering from it every day it shortens your lifespan and can even lead to suicide
2,I'm super introverted smiling_face_with_tear! I'm afraid of making friends slightly_smiling_facepensive_face
1,Friends are nice to have but not particularly necessary for me. I don't really make many despite not having any trouble talking to people.
1,"Great video and this explains perfectly why I don't have almost any friends left: I just spend my time on other stuff because I've become quite an unsociable person.
Do I regret it? Well, sometimes I do but even if I meet new people and make new friends, I just end up getting bored and go back to being alone with my dog.
It seems my +30s have made me love more my loneliness than the people but well, thanks to my dog, I still go out and talk to people but once they start talking to me way too much, I just go away...
I know, you don't care about it but well, maybe there's someone outta there who feels just like me.
Have a lovely day,
Matt"
0,#2 on trending that really sucks
1,“Well maybe it’s-just because you’re ugly”
1,"Genuine and wholesome friendships don't exist anymore.  We live in the age of the ""look at me"" generation where the number of followers you have on social media defines your social class and self-worth.  We have become a cancerous cesspool of pretentious degenerates thirsting for validation and acceptance so badly that we've turned the concept of friendship into a popularity contest driven by ad revenue, sponsorships, donations, discount codes, and referral links.  Even if you do miraculously find someone that doesn't care about your social class, there's a very high likelihood that they'll have any number of other deal-breaking flaws like being a smoker, drug addict, alcoholic, and suffering from pandemic-related mental health issues."
1,"Man, this vid hit pretty hard, having an avoidant personality disorder is an added loneliness bonus, ...great grinning_face_with_sweat Thank you for the vid though, I'm 41 now and things only seem to get harder, so I needed some of this advice! slightly_smiling_face"

1,The way schedule is pronounced
1,"So basically, I can try to be a quite kid that is active at class but doesn't talk to some people. thanks kurzgesagt."
0,Friends are a burden. Regular life is burden enough to then have more people you voluntarily have around that expect things from you. Fuck that shit.
2,The Princess of Friendship
1,"""The good news is that human brains are hardwired to seek connection"".
Wouldn't that be the bad news? After all, without it, there would probably not all that negativity of lacking said connection."
1, IS THAT THE SILENT PRINCESS FROM BOTW?
1,Remember that 5.1m people are here .you are not alone dealing this we all are together.
1,"Most of the times I am feeling that I have the opportunity to make new friends whenever I want, but for now I am focusing at my close-future plans that requires my full time contribution, and having friends means having free time to spend with them, but I hope after I'm done with my plans, I can focus a little bit on making friends and also spending great times with them"

1," nope, we were created by God and the first relationship was between God and man."
1,I'm guessing this video will have lots of views.
2,Kurzgesagt is the only chanel that can make both smile and want to cry at the same time. What a great video sparkling_heart
1,This is one that many will relate to.
1,I’ve literally just had a breakdown to my mum about how lonely I feel in the new town I live. I feel like this is a sign thank you so much.
1,Why's a Kurzgesagt video got me choking up??
1,Wow. YouTubes algorithm is giving me hintsface_with_tears_of_joy
1,We need a video about the moon
1,"The main problem you guys didn't touch on though is the soul crushing and cratering feeling of having no self worth or reason that anyone would want to get to know you. Presumably the product of sensualized and intesified charactures we see in television and the internet i guess. But it sure feels like i've got nothing to offer anyone.

Love you guys by the way. And your video on loneliness being the new epidemic was good too."
2,I’ve always been so grateful for my friends.
2,"I left my best friends and friends in NYC. I'm doing extremely great without having teachers, co-workers, friends & high school friends. 
I like learning alone.  No distraction.  Just finish where you can't finish."
1,"I was about to sleep when I saw this video popping up so I watched it. And now I couldn’t sleep.
Being someone who struggled to make friends since childhood and experienced countless social traumas in school, this video pierces through my soul.
My biggest problem currently is probably about how to start and maintain a conversation with new people without making the other person feeling weirded out. So to save all the trouble, I ended up not interacting with new people at all if not necessary, and that is killing me from the inside.
This video helped me a lot when it comes to pointing directions that I could take, but I guess the rest is up to me now."
1,"If you NEED friends or a friend, ( like this idiot narrator is trying to make you believe), its because your..........weak.
Low self esteem....low self confidence...a follower....all these and more.......you dont NEED a friend or friends, you WANT one,but you dont NEED them......there must be something in your character that people aren't attracted to perhaps your unattractive or worse,BOTH!...... whatever the reasons are....just do YOU,,,,be happy,content doing things that make you happy,,,,,dont look to believing that you need a friend for happiness, you dont.......if your ugly, have hobbies that are fun and healthy to you..exercise and get a good body if your ugly......if you have a quirky personality, or weird,or even not attractive, then accept how you are,,maybe change a few things IF YOU CAN,( As long as its within your nature)..... dont be weak and look to others for your happiness,,,"
1,I got social anxiety :D
1,"I like your videos but I can't believe you made the mistake of writing a video ""why you are lonely and how to make friends"" and then proceeds to talk about people that have friends and aren't lonely."
1,"Hey guys This is a request , You Made a great work....!!!! , Awesome Explanation , i know you have extended your channel in various versions of languages but , i need you guys to extend many more as well , like tamil , Malayalam, ....... and so on ...... I hope you take some action"
1,"I was listening to john and hank green’s podcast this morning and john likened getting older to a city bus becoming an express route. It goes the same distance, but there are less stops along the way. Being around the same age, I completely get it. Time moves faster when you’ve seen more of it. So much more time has passed than I realized since I’ve let go of some people."
1,The fuck you think you are calling me lonely... I cant get away from people. Just for that I will proceed to pollute the environment by existing
1,Lets be clear. The pandemic did nothing to young peoples social relationships. Our governments authoritarian measures did the damage.
1,"Kurzgesagt, I realy like you. 

I realy do :,)"
0,It s the video most saddest of this channel how to have friends
1,"What a nice vid...totally ignoring, that there are people out there, that will use anything you reveal them of yourself for their personal gain, abuse you to make their life easier and leave you if there is no more use for you...
What a pity..."
1,I honestly thought this was going to be a shit post
1,"Missed opportunity to write ""500% surcharge to single people"" on that theater sign."
1,"Unfortunately, being neurodivergent makes things a good bit harder. A lot of the thing you said, neurodivergent people struggle even more with this"
1,You don't got to call me out like this Kurzgesagt!
1,"the older u get, the harder it is to make friends"
1,i just wanna say to people with few or even dont have friends that you dont need to have a lot of friends to be happy. the norm of the society is telling you to have friends or else you will feel left out. but i think thats not true. i dont have friends but im not lonely either. i love solitude and i am happy about it. i just wanna slightly disagree to this video.
0,I hate youtube for recommending this.
1,How did you know that i need this-
1,"For everyone: ""The process of making friends is hard coded on an instinctual level in ALL humans."" So don't worry about not knowing how to do it, only worry about what makes you stop doing it."

0,I hate everyone.
1,"I cried through this video and I dont know why but right now am happy. I just started high school and am trying to get friends but as someone who hast had litterally any experience making friends since 1grade its very hard. Thank you for those tips I will try them out. Also , you guys also play Catan?"
1,"I have the opposite problem - many people want to make friends with me but I am too reserved and have weak boundaries so I tend to help others at my own expense, leaving me much more exhausted than without friends. Even having tea with a friends makes him excited and energetic but I am left completely exhausted for a week."
1,"i have an idea for the next video. 
Wat if we detonate a super nova next to a blackhole?"
1,"That is true cause i would do ANYTHING for my family and friends. I want to be open and make new friendships! No one wants to be alone during hard times and i still be in contact with my friends even when i moved away from school, got a job and do my therapy group. One of my fears is being alone and disconnected since i'm autistic so i'm trying my best to make awesome friends and cherish memories for years to come. God bless you Kurzgesaght! (Sorry I couldn't spell your name hahahaha!)"
2,I like how the video assumes we are lonely
1,"One time I was in a class with a couple friends. I noticed that a certain girl was always sitting next to us and I started making sure to leave thay seat empty. 
My friends often over slept, so I would strike up conversation. 
Friend +1"
2,a kurzgesagt that didn't give me existential dread? WOW.
1,"I needed this so much, it's so hard to put it all together and go for a move, and your video was a final push for me to go for it. Being currently a 9 grader, I've never had long term friendships myself, but third wheeled in any relationship i had with people, and knowing how it used to be back then, it became something scaring me till the very day im living in.
 It's all about overcoming, and never about giving up. I hope to get a use of the things i say for my own good, and i hope to get to have homies be by my side. Thank you so much for the video, kurzgesagt <3"
1,"if youre really young and reading this, make as many friends while youre not socially akward, please"
1,You should be more than just a youtube channel. I would love to have actual live Kurzgesagt events or Kursegesagt Coffee in my city.

1,"I go to conventions and actually set up a panel of ""How to make friends at cons"".

1,Are the reason we are alive
1,Bruhhhhh youtube doing me dirty for recommending this to me….
1,Couldn't have asked for a better time on this video. Just flew out of my home country for the first time to live and go to school with people I've never met.

1. Be attractive.
2. Don't be unattractive."
1,Anyone wants to make a new friend - you are welcome to message me
1,Lol this is one step away from “how to get in a relationship” if you have to watch a video on it you’ll never come out of your shell. GO OUTSIDE! GET OFF YOUR DEVICES! NO INTERNET! Lol
1,"I really think this video missed the mark.
The sunshine and rainbows perspective on making friends is iffy.

I do all the simplified steps you lay out and then end up with the self assessment im the problem.
In reality people are drawn to those who are popular, people detest that which is different by nature."
1,"It took me almost the whole video to realize that it isn't food residue on that one characters face, but a beard instead..."
1,"I’ve been struggling with this since I graduated college five years ago. It’s really hard to meet people when you don’t have structured time together and the same people constantly being around. It felt like there was always a chance to make a new friend in college, especially on weekend. Shared classes, school events, and radompy bumping into people around campus makes it pretty easy to start a conversation. But I’ve gone years without connecting with a new person since then."
1,It's very good to live alone
1,i just had my first day of school today and i was feeling really lonely. this video actually encouraged me to text some old friends and try and make new friends tomorrow. thank you!!
1,Anyone here from London eyes
1,We are living in an era where social beings have to learn how to make friends
1,"I just want someone who will be excited to watch ""Lord of the rings"" with me"
2,Perfect video for discord mods
1,I swear kurzgesagt knows when we feel down
1,"I'm going to be completely real, the USFG government wasting 2 years of our lives trying to force everyone to not socialize really did numbers on eliminating avenues of connection for tens of millions of young people in the USA. The problem increases as social media apps seek to get kids addicted to that instead of real life bonds"
1,Youtube algorithm calling me out...
1,I'm actually quiet alright with it.. I didn't have any friends for the last 10 years.
2,"Why not set up a Kurzgesagt Friends app .. it would make it easier to join and find local friends, and would be easier to organise meetups and get notifications about activities."
1,and then in about a week you'll see they just wanna sabatoge your life. humans smh
1,"Workplaces are honestly the best way to make friends. If you have an office job maybe consider giving up a Saturday evening to work in a pub/ bar and I'm sure you'll make some friends and an extra few quid.
Such great teams in the service industry"
1,"Looking around at these people in the comments make me realize I'm alive and in a bustling world. I have a lot yet to explore, internet friends are good and all but, never meeting them cuz they live on the other side of the planet means I have no ""irl friends"" at the moment, or at least I've drifted away from those I had in my childhood. Thank you kurz crew for enlightening the masses! I take your advices to heart with every video <3"
1,"What about the power of not caring about people much? ~~~ I imagine that having maybe only one close friend can help you get ahead in life easier, saving you money, just being gamers even helps the climate more too, and save for a house too (with your day job).
I'm in one of I hope are many nice Discord channels out there with people who can't help but share and care somewhat, and it's less carbon-producing, and you can learn quite a lot of helpful stuff from such groups by sharing stuff (links) and asking questions.

2,Making friends in this comments section ghost
1,"I wish it was way more acceptable to be frank with things... but unfortunately it's a signal of your (lack of) social aptitude and that you're potentially a weirdo at this point.

Would be great if you could say to a potential friend, ""I like hanging out, wanna intentionally stay friends?"" Maybe someday that could be more normalized. Most of my personal struggle is the indirectness, subtlety involved in not trying to come on too strong, resulting in not coming on at all."

1,Where the birds go ? pleading_face
1,Pfffft.  I found trying to make the effort to make friends made me loads more unhappy.  Just who is there out there to be friends with???  Most people you talk to them you can quickly tell their mind is completely gone.  I can't remember the last time a stranger told me absolutely anything that was both truthful and true.

1,"im happy you made this video as school just started for me, i constantly move schools, and making friends and being able to keep them is hard, but recently i feel like i've met some really chill people, and hope i get to know more about them :]"
1,"But it doesn't work. I am trying, so hard, but no one wants to get to know me. I do something wrong but I don´t know what"

1,"my google crashed and logged me out
apearently this video is too good for me"
0,this unironically makes me even more sad
1,pretty sure breathing air is a mental health issue nowadays. waah wahh wahhh
1,"The hardest part of making the first step is when you are willing to care and share with your friends but still you don’t get the response and attention even when you are trying your best, which probably is the most common scenario of being lonely."
1,"Girlfriend recently cheated on me, never felt more loney."

1,this upload couldn’t have been timed more perfectly
1,"At the beginning of the year, I felt more lonely than ever when my longtime girlfriend left me. 
But now, months later, I feel like I have more friends than I've ever had and I feel less alone now than I did in that relationship. 
Has anyone else had the same experience?"
1,I noticed how the german version came far earlier then this one.
2,"Great video. Also, be confident and believe that you could genuinely be a good friend to people who you want to be friends with."
1,Only reason I need a friend is for their pickup truck so that I can move a couch and mattress when it's time to move.
1,"Looking for popularity is among the wrongest, most stupid and pointless values you may have ever aimed for. You can get popular when you do something people like. Popularity comes like a side effect, a bonus. But it cannot be a goal. Because if it is, you will fail guaranteed."
2,i was watching and my friend just sent me a message.Thanks for your magical luck!
2,The Emperor protects.
1,I don't think I needed this but I just watched the whole damn thing cause it's Kurzgesagt. =D
1,"My girlfriend has been feeling lonely with less friends. I watch every single video you guys have made. I’ve learned tons and today I’ve learned I need to introduce my girlfriend to new friends. Thank you!

I hope the best of my journey. Bless you all with friends. Hold them tight. There are a lot of lonely people in the world. I for one don’t have any friends. I’ve lost them over the years as growing apart has spread us apart. I’ve been very happy without having any but I see how much she struggles without friends. Best of luck to anyone else seeking friends. Take care strangers. heart_suit"
1,"I'm that person everyone forgets about, so I decided to assume the effort of making invitations.
It's great when it works, but sadly I could see how some people prioritize the smallest issues over some time with me (even in my birthday lol)... At least that way I also shifted focus on the people who actually show up.
It's still kind of sad to let the unresponsive ones go, but inviting demands more energy than it seems - I just can't keep wearing myself out by insisting on them."
1,"nah this was posted too early to when I was talking to ppl online abt how I struggle to make friends, somethings up lol"
1,"This video could not have come out at a better time, i don't have many friends and getting called ugly on a dating app for sure adds to the lonely feeling, top that on low self esteem and self confidence"
1,You're gonna make me cry Kurzgesagt
1,"Most of my friends started with me just saying some one liner, and somehow it turning into a conversation."
2,Me who make more friends all the time…
1,Years  ago out of no where I just randomly stopped talking with my entire group of childhood friends. I literally don't remember why or how it happened. Crazy how we hung out everyday for years and just randomly stopped talking. I guess some of the reason is because they moved to highschool while I was still in elementary. We were a combined class but they were a grade ahead of me.  Never take friendships for granted.
1,Lets make a new friends in the commentsmiling_face_with_open_handswaving_handwaving_hand
1,"Extroverts listen to Parliament, and introverts Sade? Yea, sounds about right."
1,"""regularly spending time with people in the real world""...  nope!"
1,100% Spot on! Beautifully made and thoughtfully put together! Loved that Introversion was separated from shyness as the two are not mutually exclusive.
1,I hate the fact that I search “how do I make friends”crying_facesleepy_face
1,"dang, my YouTube recommendations are getting more sad to look at"
1,"I've been a full time human for what feels like a while now, and I really can't understate the power a deep friendship can have. There's very few things that fulfill me as much in life as spending good quality time with my friends. The advice of ""be yourself"" is  said so often nowadays that it fails to mean anything, but seriously, the weirder you are, the stronger your friendships will be. Weird people appreciate weird people. And if you're not weird, that's fine too."
1,I would like to thank the media and society for making this harder than it needs to be for everyone.
0,i want to but my government block reditloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_face
2,This is too wholesome. Thanks.
1,these videos make me feel so warm
1,"We humans, like most living things, are diverse within our own species. Some are red-haired, some, blond; some are tall, some, short; dark- and light-skinned; and so on. And social affinity also is diverse. I have never been happier than during the COVID19 pandemic, alone at home for many months. Unfortunately, it couldn't last long enough."
1,Finally! I really needed this
1,"As a 19 years old I am extremely introverted I lived my whole life in another country then I moved to another on my 16th birthday in a country where I Dont even speak the language they speak and they don't speak the language I speak then I joined 10th grade made some friends and the  pandemic ruined  it all last year I graduated from high school what made it worse I joined that last year abit late because financial problems the sec the school year ended I feel like I didn't make any meaningful friends I don't
Just feeling empty"
2,"My family provide me the best friendships I could ask for. I can only hope you can have thay kind of family and if you don't, then don't give up, keep working towards your goals."
1,"I don't want to get into what happened personally over the last 4 weeks, it was a little intense to say the least. What this video does not account for perhaps at least up front is the sheer amount of narcissistic and abusive type of people this attracts looking for victims. I ended up going from 1 week of an amazing time to being bullied to near suicide off of discord entirely by a group of people who decided to run the show and harass myself and several other people, and... yeah it just did not end well. This is like honey for abusers seriously and then they are able to prey on people who are unsuspecting. Thankfully I have my partner to lean on and get through this but I'm not okay right now. I truly hope everyone who participates is alright but I fear my experience won't be the last of its kind."
0,Trust is the greatest weakness. They can destroy your life dont make friends.
1,"Worst thing is, i've enjoyed solitude for so long and pushed friends away for so long that i've reached an extreme state of loneliness. It was addictive, now i'm trapped. Getting out of this horrible place is very hard."
1,"I see you guys decided that subtle subjective existential dread wasn't enough so you're switching to direct attacks. Still, very good content, keep up"
2,Wow what strange and perfect timing <3
1,"Why is it that when you make these videos on loneliness and isolation, you depict it as happening to women, when men are the ones more likely to deal with lack of friends and isolation?"
1,"It would've been a bit funny if for when there was that scene of playing jokes on your friends, instead of writing on his face they were performing open heart surgery."
1,Can you make a video about breakups and what mean to us?
1,"As an Autistic adult, a lot of this confuses me. I'm extroverted and love being around people, but I'm confused precisely by that boundary between sharing too little and oversharing, or between caring too little and stressing myself out over other people's problems. It gets in the way of friendships more often than not."
1,I really appreciate that Sade cameo.
1,Thankfully my brain is wire-ed weirdly and I have near 0 social quota - cause friendship takes way more effort than I'm willing to spend
1,And are you talking about when it's always the same people who reach out for the other friend ? Never reciprocating relation?
1,No birdies? Amazing video though :)
2,boardgames are a great hobby to keep friends close!
1,"Just started at college and I really suck at going up to people and talking, this is nice to see."
1,Maybe if I am crying while I watch this video I have a problem...

1,"What a coincidence, started college and needed this lol"
1,When is the Jurassic Duck coming out? I want to watch it! Is it about Asteriornis a.k.a. Wonderchicken!
1,You are lonely because you are an atheist without a purpose in life
1,"Recently an empty nester and feel very lonely.   I have no friends, I've been too busy raising children.  Divorced 20 years ago and threw myself into single parenting and working.  Finding it  difficult everyday to fill my days with activities that are stimulating.  Having friends seems like a foreign concept, although I use to have plenty years ago."
1,"I appreciate this video, although I'm slightly surprised there wasn't more of an emphasis on context at both the micro & macro scale.

At an individual level, sometimes people are held back from relationships for reasons that contribute to them feeling stuck in their situation (with varying degrees of control) like being in an abusive relationship, or medical diagnoses. At the societal level, some individuals might not want to be exposed to too many people if an airborne virus is still circulating while most protective measures are being dropped.

To sum up my point, forming/maintaining relationships (at this moment in time) would look very different for a typical healthy 20 y/o than a 30 y/o with autism, an autoimmune disease, & a history of abusive romantic relationships."
1,"Not trying to rip on the video, because I believe its virtual heart is in the right place - but we live in a world that has not only a cost-of-living crisis - but a discretionary time crisis.  The two are related.  Not to mention a violence/crime crisis. The need for more income in the vast majority of cases = more time working.  And I haven't even gotten to Covid and the fact that as of August 2022, the US is averaging 13 mass shootings a week according to an NBC analysis of data from the GVA (Gun Violence Archive).  We live in a world that isn't exactly primed for starting friendships these days."
1,But I am ugly and everyone thinks I’m always mad at my school which most of the time I’m sad because I don’t have any friends. What do I do if my appearance makes everyone go away? :(
1,"Why are you making me cringe like this, on one hand i can't just ""don't watch a video of the most famous science channel"" but on the other hand this is making me feel like i need a video to learn how to make friends. I am going crazy"
1,*Borderline Personality Disorder* doesnt help the situation either..
1,"I really like how you remixed the music from the first ""Lonliness"" video you made."
1,the second half was cut off and damn did i feel called out...
1,"Maybe everyone stop making YouTube videos and all other social media ,and people stop looking in their phones and go outside to havr new friends"
1,"I had 2 close best friends back then.  We would always call or play. Even when we sometimes argue, it would always be just for a few days, then we'd be on good terms again. When the pandemic came, we were still close. We planned a reunion from time to time, but it wasn't enough to keep our friendship together since we're in different schools now. What makes me feel hurt the most is when I see them both, still close best friends. Seeing their ig stories, them going to the mall. And the hardest thing I still yet to accomplish is to socialize. Ever since this pandemic, I never made new friends. Even now, I still feel alone. If you're still reading this, thank you. I really put all my emotions into this comment. I want you to know that you aren't alone :)"
2,The thing is that people can make fun of you and you hear them and it give you less trust in you.
1,"Ya'll might wanna double check that 'introverts don't like spicy food, outroverts do' because lemme tell you, as an introvert with multiple introvert and extrovert friends, none of my extrovert friends like spicy food, all my introvert friends do."
1,i know have the urge to go out and tell people they have nice abs
2,if you watch dream and thats the reason why your here like this comment
1,"As someone who is starting fresh in a new area, I want to say thank you so much for this. I've been feeling so many of the things you've outlined here, and I'm struggling. So, thanks! you're doing great work"
1,"Imagine everyone have at least 50 friends which can help each other, then how could capitalism exploits the workers by eliminating their choice and making them work long hours with low wages? Capitalism is not only against unionisation, it's also against friendship making."
1,"It's strange. I'm African, I've lived in Europe but moved back to Africa. Here, it's so easy to make friends. The culture makes it very easy to talk to, and meet random people. When I was abroad, people were more individualistic. I made acquaintances but not TRULY friends. Something about developed countries that alienates people from each other"
1,"If anyone is looking for a friend to play smite, dbd, vhs, or even dnd (haven't played before because I have never found interested friends) please hmu, i do have some few irl friends but none are interested in video or boardgames."
2,"This episode is so wholesome, and I absolutely love it."
2,And this is why Kurzgesagt is on top
1,"i gave up on making friends for sometime, i got tired of being abandoned, being made fool of, stoled, i guess im not a lucky person w friends cus doesnt matter how hard i try, they end up abandoning or replacing me w somebody else, i feel very frustat everytime i try"
1,Kurzgesagt knows its public...
1,"In history there was no such a thing as ""friends"", but now the one that control society wants us to be in a box that doesn't fit us at all, in general they want us to be something we are not, or aiming for a porpuse that we don't want to.  As you getting old you realise it's all lies, lies to sell you products, and this video ain't no different, 
They want you to be rich, they want you to have a dream, they want you to be smart and ""successful"", if someone decided to leave in the street without nothing, he is ""nothing"" for them. if someone is alone without friends, he is ""nothing"" and ""usless"" it's all abrain wash.
In history there was no friends because people were poor and thought only about the next meal, after they got rich they started to make you think you need money, and money will bring you friends too , it's all goes together you see.
The truth is that you don't need a purpose to live satisfing life, you don't need friends, you just need to be relax, the more you aiming for somthing the more you will push it a way and be misrable.
If you are a lone, start to be a friend of yourself, that is the only secret no one wants you to know, the structior of a family , love, nature, relaxation and simple life destroid because of this saientist that trying to tell yuo ""how to"", no need to do nothing or be nothing. don't believe them , that is why people getting more and more hateful toword sience, you understand?  because sience in one hand want to help you , in other hand make your life misrable by trying to fit you in their box, they can not accept you as you are, never."
2,Does anyone want to become friends
1,"Kurgzgeast: So the most important principle of making to regularly spend time with people,

Kurgzgeast: , In real life.

2,I genuinely love this channel so much :D
2,Who wants to be friends?
2,I lost two friends. Through those two friends I probably lost about 50 acquaintances.
2,I love this channel
1,"Instead of feeling better, now I feel worse about not having any friends despite I've tried a lot to make them. Some people would agree that this is not meant for everybody, there are some exceptions in life."
1,this is a very important question: could i make a black hole
1,"My fellow introverted college students, where you at?"
1,"I have always had a lot of friends but some of them are quite detestable and i dropped them this summer holiday and damn, it made me feel better, making me want to get better, for 2 months straight every single day except 12-26th of july i worked out for over 1hour (everyday not like 1/2 or 1/3days) i have made money cause they were stopping me because of how they were, assh*les, i even finally found out the job i wanted to do, it made me much happier leaving them, if you have friends like this you should do it, they probably will stop you from getting to your dreams, i never have found love because for them it was ""cringe"", i have found the perfect girl i could have ever dreamed about, that's all i have to say about this that relates with this video, friends are cool, too much is bad and stop you from pursuing your dreams."

1,Their next video: tutorial for life
2,I think it’s important to mention that you shouldn’t try to make friends with everybody because some friendships do more harm than good
1,"I love this video so much. It really helped me with the anxiety of looking for friendships. It’ll be nerve racking and I might be a little awkward, but I’m looking  forward to the connections I’ll make with others. I’m so trying the subreddit"
1,I can't help but feel targeted with this video.
1,"This comment section is also a social space. So here's a invitation for you, yes you, to send a message here if you'd wanna talk. Who knows, we can all make some friends in the process! :-)"
1,Thanks for the video! I don't want even imagine how much effort it costs to produce thumbs_up
1,"I'm not going to lie... I've done just about all of these and nothing has stuck. Some of us are just meant to be alone and that's the sad truth of the world. We find a person to ostracize and we do it without question. 

Honestly I'm done with it all. I'm so numb that breaking a bone barely phases me. I just dont care anymore"
2,"Since when does Kurzgesagt become happy and feel good and stopped with the existential dread episodes?
Not that I'm complaining, I love this, but, I kind of miss those episodes too. slightly_smiling_face"

1,Ah finally something educational
1,This literally came out at just the right moment
0,It’s just so hard losing friends
1,"This video hit me so hard. I am crying my eyes out. I have felt very lonely every since high school graduation. All my friends were accepted into colleges yet I was not. I was left behind. They said we would stay in touch but it feels impossible. I’m still struggling to get into college I am just afraid, all I need to do is make a stupid phone call and I am practically in, but that fear of rejection kicks in every time I look at the number. The fear of rejection is not just the fact I won’t go to that college but also the fact that I won’t be able to rebuild a social structure. I haven’t spent time with anyone except my immediate family for months, I love them but I feel it tearing me apart to the point that it’s hard to eat, sleep, and be happy. Every laugh, every smile, every action feels so forced as if those actions are like climbing mountains. This video has done so much for me. I am making that call tomorrow. I am finishing my last few applications tomorrow. This video has given me that motivation to actually try and get my life back together. Thank you, Kurzgesagt. Thank you."
2,I have a few thousand friends
0,is this a personal attack?
2,Perfect video for me?
1,Been going to college for years with no new friends
2,"TLDR make new friends by  finding someone with the same interests, make sure they pas the vibe check, and talk to them. it may be scary, but the risk is only them not being interested. the potential reward is a life long friendship."
1,"Hey, if you are feeling loneliness or have something that’s bugging you and want a dad to lend you an nonjudgmental ear. Reach out <3"

1,im not supposed to like spicy food?
1,I recently lost a friend when I tried to confess to her. She was the one who invites our friend group together. I feel like i have lost everything now. I still can't recover and I don't think i will make it.
1,Have to be honest here. These series with each episode getting more and more depressed . An observation
1,Why am I lonely? Because gladiatorial games are not being held anymore...
2,OK this video recommendation is way too specific
1,This video hits extremely hard.
1,"Dont have any friends by choice. Cut off all the childhood friends for not having any need for them. Havent missed friends at all in few years.

 Introversion can be an asset, i am all the people i need. :)"

2,"This is cool, but what is crazy is that I won’t be existing forever so who cares"
1,"You already made a video 3 years ago that talks about ""Loneliness"", so I guess this must be the sequel to the original."
1,I did not expect to get rosted by a science show
1,Quarter of a million views in an hour. I think I know what all the lonely people are doing…
1,I didn’t have any friends from 18-32 but I moved to a new city and now I’ve made some good friends. If you’re in the same situation maybe you also need to physically and mentally distance yourself from where you are currently  :)

1,"How to make friend's.
Step 1: quit being an introvert and be a extrovert.
Step 2: use social media often.
Step 3: make friend's
Step 4: don't get a girlfriend so your friend's doesn't get jealous or steal it.
Step 5: live a happy life being anti-introvert."
1,"There's a lot of assholes out there though, whose only goal is to make ""friends"" they can use or manipulate. This video is incredibly naive"

1,"I was looking for that video about loneliness literally 10 seconds ago, and this one pops in my face, perfect moment"
1,Remember:Just because you don't have friends now does not mean you never will. If you are feeling down or sad don't worry because there are other people feeling the same. And one day you will have friends who you can have fun with.
2,smh really Calling me out like that
2,"Friends, love, that kind of shit does not exist, unless you have money or looks. People do what they do for their own gains only, noone gives a fuck about you."
2,Lol playing games online with people is just as good as real life. Even better because I can make friends with people who have the same interests. Not who was nearby which is lazy as hell and leads to having awful friends you shouldn't have.
1,I've got a wife and a 6 months old daughter. I just don't have more space in my heart for people. Sorry!
1,"I have depression. I have been struggling with it for the last 15 years. It's not just social, but academic, habit based, activities, work related issues that I face on a daily basis. I can't bring myself to face the world on a consistent basis. My life is huge ups and downs. I compensate for my downtime, with vigorous energy when I am feeling good. 

I have good personality to make friends, but maintaining them is so, so hard for me. I need external impetus, to energize me. But then I lose it too, over time and fall back and go into my shell."
1,"Me, an introvert who enjoys loud music and spicy foods"
1,"It's way easier for me to make friends on the Internet - and rather not on the apps dedicated to it (the conversations tend to die pretty fast, and the goal ""you're here to make friends"" puts pressure on me) but on the websites, forums or discord servers dedicated to some hobby, like talking about a series or role-playing and writing. There is already a topic to start with, and we just know each other better and better naturally. On the other hand, it's hard for me to find people I'm vibing with in a school environment. It also takes me more time to be figure out who I would like to get to know better - people already have some stronger relationships at this time. And even if I do success to some extent, these relationships cancel practically immediately the day we graduate this school - because they existed only in the said environment. The only exception is when I actually talked with a person also after school. The problem is that a development like this happens naturally, and... well, it doesn't happen often. But how to help develop these relationships that are specific-evironment-only into something more? That's the hard part."
1,"This may be related to my autism, but I don't experience loneliness. I was pretty sure about that for years, but it was confirmed during the pandemic when I spent months without interacting with anyone, other than the occasional doctor's visit. I was able to focus more on my writing and published 3 books. I am slowly re-establishing friendships as the pandemic wanes, but I am consciously keeping that circle of friends small."
1,"Saying ""Global pandemic"" is redundant. PANdemic already means it's GLOBAL."
1,"Bold of you to assume I’m lonely






 (you’re right though)"
1,Am I being called out
0,"Im incapable of keeping friends
As they usually Betray me or i Betray them... Theres only one exception."
1,"I tried to watch. I could not. Maybe life works differently in certain social spheres, but for people persecuted by power structures (religious, discreet societies, etc.), concepts like ""love"", ""friendship"", ""family"" are impractical and a video like this it is an insult to my intelligence.

Everyone who comes into my life is paid for it. Or else he approaches me with the intention of gaining some advantage in the interaction.

Thus, there is not much to say about “friendships”, when there is a dirty and hypocritical game of interests under the table. Unfortunately, that was the only truth that life taught me."
2,i want a friend
1,To make it simple he's saying get out of your house the pandemic is no more and socialize
1,Bro you don't have to be alone to feel lonely
1,pov: you got called out by this video
1,Man I don’t need friends I have another person “scrolling”
1,"Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life. 943"
1," UNLESS YOU ARE BESFRIENDS!!!!!
then u can stay very long without interaction"
1,"Just started to feel lonely 4 hrs ago and now 
You gotcha firefire"
1,"Worst Kurzgesagt I've ever seen. ""It's not okay to like to be alone. That just means something is wrong with you and you're lonely."" Seriously?"
1,Really useful
1,"This is so nice!
I had to learn to make friends when I moved to a different country, it was a daunting task at first, but it made me realize that I can do it, that people like me and that I am worth <3 
Having friends and positive social relationship is really important and it should be a priority when deciding how to use your time"
1,"I shall now be addressed as ""The Central Hub of the Friend Network."""
2,Ayo who’s tryna be friends smirking_face
1,holy shet desktop youtube is sooooooo beautiful right now
1,Can i report this video for personal attack?  ( side note that was a joke people)
1,"When my best friend of 6 years told me he only talked to me because he had no one else to hang out with it absolutely crushed me, still don't have any real friends since then"
1,"Making friends it's easy, keeping them close to you for decades, THAT'S the hardest part! People grow, change, move, etc. 
After 20+ years I am still in contact with my best friends from childhood and I often invite them to my new city or go back home and we always meet, we often play videogames online, share memes, etc. the key is keep the connection, get interested in their life. I'm super lazy to get out, so I trick my new city friends and invite them over, they get free food/drinks and I get company, everyone happy! There are many tricks to make friends and keep them for a long time. Don't give up!"
1,Ever since I quit FaceBook my friend groups IRL have vanished slowly. Then the Pandemic hit. Then God laughed and I went on HRT. It's rough out there but the thing I learned the hard way was to be OK with yourself and you're never lonely.
1,"I needed this, I started feeling like I didn't need friends. I feel like I don't want to hang out every few days and I'm better off by myself. Maybe I will consider building connections after this video."
1,"I stopped feeling a need for friends some years ago. I am still in schools but don't have any friendships, but I feel happy! The only thing I am tired of hearing is other people saying I should socialize and hang out with people. I spend most of my day studying or learning programming. My parents are always saying ""Go out! Hang out with your friends! The world isn't in the computer!"" and stuff like that. But the issue is that being with people gives me anxiety, even with people I know like some of my classmates. I don't like to go to places, and sometimes when my parents inevitably drag me somewhere to their friends house, or when some of their friends ask me to fix their computer I get tired of that interaction. I also like a lot of nerdy things like programming, linux, computers and stuff like that, that makes having friends in a country like portugal (Where if you are a boy you automatically need to love football and every conversation is about football) pretty difficult. Then you'll say ""Socialize with girls!"". Yeah... about that... my classroom has 3 girls. And all three aren't really interesting to talk to... Is this feeling normal? Thanks people who scrolled this much until they found my comment!"
2,I was just thinking I wish I had friends.
1,"After a while, I think I am better off accepting to do things on my own. Friendships end, once the carrying partner becomes uninterested. 
You come to this world alone, you gonna leave it alone. You're the best friend you'll ever have.
Why bother emotionally attaching to people and spending so much time on something that might end in a day and wound you for months and years?"
1,"One of the worst advices from the pandemic was stay inside, not only was it ineffective because outdoors was one of the safest spots to be, the sheer isolation had caused incalculable harm."
1,Tik Tok is a disease.
1,"I miss out, this should happen again soon."
1,"I’m teen and have only two best friends, I can’t enjoy spending time with someone else actually. Now, I’m happy, but always worried about loosing them and being left alone since I don’t have a lot of other friends. I feel vulnerable…"
1,Yoo
2,okay but what if no one likes me how am i supposed to make friends
2,This video is full of copium and far from reality. Only weak need friends. In ideal world all people will treat all people equally. And for now with friendship as with love most important thing is money.
1,"I have a lot of good friends but I'm also very socially anxious. :v Also haven't had a chance to see them for a long time, but do still see them on occasion (but certainly less than I used to, since no one is local anymore)."
1,"whenever someone asks me this i just say ""i can't explain, it's bad luck i guess"""
1,"I’m an introvert with good communication skills, as a result I made many extrovert friends, but I struggled to keep on answering or meeting other extroverts because I was more comfortable on my own and didn’t want to move. But in reality that actually turned out to be a mistake and my reasoning in third person person perspective wasn’t because I’m an introvert, but because of lethargy, which might be true.

If you’re an introvert reading this remember if you friend wants to meet you then just go and meet them out of you comfort zone, as long as that doesn’t interfere with you life goals of course!"
1,"USed to have so much friends, now I can't even make friends online, this is horrible."
1,Learn to live alone and seek your goals ambitions and your full potiential
1,"I tend to push everyone away before they can hurt me.  It would seem paranoid if it wasn't true.  Loyalty doesn't mean much to anyone anymore, and it means so much to me."
2,Help others and you will help yourself in return
1,"Finding friends is difficult when people are shit. There's also the case that you need to ""compartmentalize"" a lot nowadays. Like, I can be friends with someone but then have to accept the fact that they have problematic worldviews. If you can't do this, making ""friends"" is next to impossible."
1,"I'm lonely because my government quarenteened everyone for three years and created a mass social divide, but thanks."
1,Being extroverted your whole life then developing social anxiety is the worst :>
1,"I used to always say/explain all of in the first half of the video to ""friends"" who told me they don't need to put in effort because real friends don't expect or friendships can last without one putting in effort. Thanks for making this video, making initially good friends change their perspective before I or circumstance turn them into strangers."
1,Looks at own desk... I still have a working portable cd player just like the one in the video!!
1,me relising why am i watching this...
0,Discord mods:
1,"Reciprocity has been my biggest issue. I can give and offer and provide my energy, attention, and care as much as I want - but if they don't return it then I'm basically just a fan. It's a huge energy sink face_with_rolling_eyes how in the world do you build relationships with people if they won't even talk to you?"
2,"Lmao it's impossible to make genuine ""friends"" thanks for the empty video Kurtz."
1,Too late now

0,I feel personally attacked
1,"Me, a sociopath taking notes memogrinning_face_with_smiling_eyes"
1,Me too lazy and too busy with other stuff to make friends.
2,you assume I can scroll through my friends to call them ... (joking though
1,How does this apply to exes?
1,"Personally, I think people should have less friends, but better ones. There's no use in having 10000 friends if you don't have close connections. Less is more here."
0,existence is a prison
1,Learn to be happy with your own company.
1,"I am always amazed how relevant your videos are to my current states of being. 
im an introvert quiet person but i work in the entertainment industry as a vocalist backing in a grammy nominated band and lead in my own and corporate projects and even though my job entails entertaining people and being approachable i find making friends like myself so difficult, i dont like to party too much as its my job i mainly like to go for walks, exercise, cook new things and watch anime/the Simpsons, (for that sweet nostalgia hit) when im not recording or rehearsing or performing and the people i meet think the way i code during work is how i am every waking moment. its hard to make friends when you realise you have been working during your casual catch ups. 

probably another topic for another video. 
coding for work family and social life and how to unify the individual you truly are to be cohesive with the various ""versions of ourselves"""
1,im bothered because how they manage 3D perspectives with this art style
1,I felt a little attacked by the title face_with_tears_of_joy
2,Sometimes your Friends start to become tired of you and finds someone else to become there new Best Friend. It is one of the greatest pains in life
1,Sad.  This is what it's come to huh.. having to make a video for people to learn how to make friends.
1,"Me: ""I need to get out and do more things.""
Le Friend: ""Hey, wanna go paintbaling? I'll pay for everything and drive you and literally handle everything, just put on clothes that day!""
Me: ""Ugh this is too much pressure gah I can't do this oh emm eff gee please save me from all the people trying to get an arm and a leg!""
Also me: ""Why do I never do anything?"""
1,Is the YouTube algorithm trying to tell me that I have no friends and am spending too much time on YouTube by putting this in my recommended?
2,you can’t call out your fan base like that
1,"27 and the only friend I have is my s/o. It's sad and I feel the weight of it nearly ever day. Every time I make friends though I seem to get stabbed in the back or they just leave. They either aren't who I thought, talk badly about me/the things I care about, or they just stop talking to me. I used to talk to people at work here and there but just lost my job of 8 years so that's not helping the loneliness. I just always feel like I'm the one prioritizing and no one seems to put in the effort which gets exhausting =/"
1,We're lonely because someone thought social media was a good idea. Thanks Zucc.
2,"I had lots of friends in high school and college. I was quite popular not for my looks or any status but for just how easily likable I was. But when I moved to a different country for work, I had a very difficult time making friends. 10 years of working and living in this country and I've only made 2 friends. I'm not even friends with their friends. Just these 2 people who are nice enough to talk to me or hangout with me. I've tried making friends with their friends but it just doesn't work. Eventually, I lost any interest and motivation in making new friends."
2,Bro stop making fun of me loudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_face
1,This video is long overdue after the loneliness video
1,Yesss i can finally make friands
2,Yeah I'm 19 and have 0 friends or interests lol it's over
1,"Hey kurzgesagt, could you do a video on violence? Been feeling weird and sad lately and wanna know what I have"
1,"I can't even describe How Alone I became now, I have Only my family talk to in daily life routine. I'm studying in college but I don't feel fitting with college mates.... I'm just on the edge of giving up if I don't have anyone whom I can explain openly what I am going through. My head hurts daily, thinking about my past friends and now they don't even text me or any type of contact tho I used to talk to them regularly...disappointed_face"
1,Bruh why is this on my front page I got friends nearly the whole class my friend group has over 6-10 people in it bruh I still tryna know why this on my front page
1,"I am crying right now, it was very touching yet tough to watch.

This video is the message I didn't ask for, but needed. Need friends as well!"
1,YouTube recommended me this 20 minutes ago…
1,Everyone's so busy and things cost money ;-; and people don't tend to like me
1,"All 26 years of my life have basically been wasted. I've had no good friends or had any experiences that i can share when talking to people. Didn't do anything through my teenage years. I suspect i'll just be alone until the day i die, a day that might actually come sooner rather than later."

2,But what is too few friends? Its natural that as one grows older they have less friends.
2,"from the bottom of my heart, thank you."
0,"There is no way for me to make friends. It was hurting so bad. I came up with a different solution, 60 mg of prozac solves everything. I like it when it doesn’t hurt anymore."
1,"It is very important to have a similar schedule, me and my best friend were in the same class and then he switched classes and we have really drifted apart since then, it has been hard and i hope one day we will reconnect, but it really has affected me badly"
1,"I had figured out the tenets of this video and found them to be true, but the single biggest social realization I've personally had is to be who I am as opposed to who I'm told to be."
1,I feel like there should be a separate video for people with ADHD and autism...
1,"I am a college student who almost graduate which is in final semester, until now I don't have a real friend. I try to make friends with my classmates but it's not easy for me, especially with my ego. I am too shy, I feel like I am the problem."
1,I don't have time anymore for these things. I don't feel like I need friends anymore
2,I have 3 friends and I’m only very close with 1 :/
1,I feel more lonely around people than by myself.
1,"This video couldn’t have come up at a better time. Right now is the loneliest I’ve ever felt, I’ve left college with a pretty bad relationship with my friends that were there, and I’ve just had surgery meaning I can’t go to university this coming year and I’m having to take a gap year to work. What’s worse is that the friends I did have a strong connection and my boyfriend are leaving for university in a few weeks, at which point I’ll be at the stage where I could start going out and having fun with them again, which now can’t happen. Apart from that, I don’t have many other friends and I am worried for the future

Although, the working with others of similar interests comment on this video struck me. Next year, I’m was thinking of doing an animal volunteering experience for a few weeks on my own, but then again, this would be a great opportunity to meet people with similar interests. Even if this is only for a couple of weeks, social media might actually help in this situation by having the ability to stay in contact with these people in my area. So all in all, I think this video has made me more inclined to do this. Thank you Kurtzgesagt for making this, you’ve probably helped so many more people today from the scanning I’ve done through other comments. Let’s see where the next year takes me :)))"
1,What if I'm just an asshole?
1,wtf kurzgesagt? this content is not what people come to see from you
1,"Thanks for answering a question I was too embarrassed to ask someone for a detailed response.
Love, an introvert"
1,Friends are overrated I literally pushed everyone away I have 1 friend only I see once in few months he is same as I am.
1,"Social anxiety has harmed so much of my life when it comes to friends. Today, while still lonely a lot of the time, I've made a few good friends, one of them my best, we've talked every day for 4 years,  and at no point have we gotten tired of eachother, we just communicate and talk about issues and work through them as we've both realised how rare and valuable what we have is, and it's worth keeping. I hope everyone can get a friend like that,  it's made life less scary knowing that outside of family, regular friends and romance, I have him and he has me"
2,I would like to have friends from internet growing_heart
1,Whaaa? Why does this come up as soon as I mention to someone that I am lonely? I moved to a new high school on the other side of the US a month ago and I have not made a single true friend yet. This is so convenient lol
1,"Some of it hurts but some of us needed to hear it. Thanks, Kurzgesagt. Truly."
1,"I was extremely social from my late teens until into my 30's, but have really reduced the number of acquaintances over the last 10 years or so. I value trust and respect a lot more as I age since it produces less problems when you can rely on those you share your time with. Remember that we accumulate wisdom with age, there's a reason most people's circle of friends reduce as we get older."
0,I guess we're all lonely
1," I've had many of these reasons happen in my life, some even multiple times. 
My parents moved a lot and large distances, so I never had many friends or for very long. I had a romantic relationship end badly, which cost me some very close friends. My father died suddenly, on whom me and my mother were extraordinarily dependent for our contacts.
I hate saying it, but life has not been kind to me when it comes to these factors in maintaining relationships of almost any kind."
1,"""Do things for yourself without expectations."""
1,we all need someone
1,In other words: touch grass
1,"For the ""Getting more lonelier because of the pandemic"" part. I'd say the opposite is the case for me because I've pretty much gotten more friends and I began to actually socialize more due to me being online and playing multiplayer games all that time. This was the case for me due to me being lonely during the previous school year because of my mental health during that time(and it didn't helped that my classmates were pretty much harassing me for being an atheist)."
1,"Oh you think I don't have friends, well...










I dont"
1,Americans do be taking an L though
2,Someone hug me crying_face
1,I really hope this video ends up getting millions of vinews and reaches people everywhere.
2,got this video in my recommended had to call me out like that
1,I am lonely because I can not have friends or normal relationships. This is due to the fact that everyone “knows” who I am before they actually get to know me. This is never not creepy.
1,So by Extrovert and Introvert at  im an ambovert? i like spicy food but i also have many properties of being an introvert.
1,Don't do this. Don't give me hope.
1,I feel personally attacked by this video's title
1,Introvert that likes spicy food here
0,I feel personally attacked with this showing up in my recommended D:
1,"why you are lonely? because capitalism, you are in competition with most of the people you interact with on a daily basis and that’s not the foundation for forming friendships"
1,"One of Kurzgesagt's weaknesses is that it cannot (refuses to) deal with the influence of neoliberal capitalism in various areas. A significant contributing factor to modern loneliness is capitalism's atomization of society - the ""century of self"" (to quote the documentary) which was encouraged by and exploited by neoliberalism.

People are being pushed into positions where they cannot form stable connections to others, because nobody except the top 5% of neoliberal capitalist countries enjoys the stability and sense of security to invest in lasting emotional bonds. Everyone is poor, indebted, and becoming worse off every day. While there can be some level of commonality at the lowest levels of destitute poverty (where people truly have nothing but one another), it is the people trapped within the great rig of capitalism within the working poor class (which now includes what used to be the middle class) who are emotionally shredded by the rat race."
2,"It is soo hard to make this montage
I can only thank this channel by liking the video and share it"
1,I can't even remember the last time I was invited to anything. I'd be so happy if anyone invited me to game night.
2,"Online friends better
Because you can always find their account"
2,"Me, a teenager, with few friends, who hasn't touched tiktok: ""interesting"""
2,Thank you so much for this one! There is nothing more important than real friendships
1,"kurzgesagt: the universe is going to end and here's how
also kurzgesagt: people want to be your friend :)"
1,I grew up without friends. Thanks to the internet I managed to meet some friends. I can't see them irl but talking with them like this is more than enough for me.
1,"""There are plenty of people who will be so happy to have you in their life""
sneezing_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_face"
1,Ty red_heartred_heart I probably need to touch some grass
1,"4 months back I had same condition, now I have 4 of the best friends I can ever have , we even lie down on grass watching the sky. And they are the best people I have ever met."
1,"I don't know, but I don't feel comfortable being surrounded by people. If someone called me a ""friend"", which happens so often to me, I know that I'm not a good friend, so I start to get further from them to safe place"
1,What the I guess you are in nutshell
1,"For a sensitive empath  an observant at heart, it is way too difficult to form friendship outside school, college and work where we are naturally together•"
0,What the hell is this impeccable timing
1,The biggest influence that makes people have no friends is mostly social media and phones and I think we need to move a bit away from these mindless activities and do something more physical and enjoyable
1,we need a video on how to get a girlfriend
2,A well timed video. Thank you ♡
1,Now a days they are making videos on very boring topics......
1,Haha I tried talking to a stranger and it was soo awkward.
2,Great video road to 20 mil
1,"'and a lock of social connection is associated with a number of diseases and a shorter life.'

Welp, guess I'll die in a few days"
2,"Okay YT, it was rude to recommend this."
1,"We went from why the earth is all alone and we will unavoidably burn into nothingness and black dwarfs will rule the empty dead void of space to how to make friends, and this is what we call character development. relieved_face"
2,"wow, i’m kinda lost for words, thank you!"
1,"Actually the worst thing about finding friends in school is the current friend groups. Ppl just dont accept new ppl to their groups. It kinda sucks. I was moved to another school last year and ironically EVERYONE had a friend group. I tried to say hi and chat with them but eventually they were like "" my friends are waiting I gotta go bye"". Like bro how am I supposed to make new friends when people are so closed to make new friends:/"
1,I like relatable videos but this is just to far man
2,I want to make friends but at the same I can’t be bothered
1,"I don't really understand the concept of being lonely as I have, from my best guess, always been lonely? The reason I say that is cause for someone to become lonely, they must first have known what it is like to NOT be lonely, then lose the connection and become lonely, correct? I have never been able to open up to people. I have extreme social anxiety to the point I can't talk to people at all. When people do manage to get to know me, they only know the version of me I carefully construct specifically for them. They will never know the real me, at least not intentionally. If there are people out there who are like me and would actually be my friend, the truth is they all would be doing the same thing I am doing and not be looking for friends at all. It is too much of a hassle to deal with and not worth the cons it comes with. And one recurring thing that has always bothered me is how people make their whole life about love, relationships, etc and it is all they talk about. It just gets so annoying hearing how sad and depressed they are because something happened between them and someone else, so now they need someone, or something, to support them in some way or another. Maybe a friend would be nice, but I honestly doubt it if it includes being depressed whenever I can't connect with them. I'd rather be lonely and happy, than to experience friendship, lose said friend, then become the same as every other person that cries and complains about how depressed they are and begin to use drugs or find other outlets to alleviate their woes. Maybe this all makes me out to be a horrible person, or a broken one, or both. Who am I to truly know."
1,"They had to post  this video  right this moment,"
2,A million views in 9 hours. Interesting.
2,Your videos are great!
1,"""being in a room together without saying a word might make others more sympathetic to you""

Kurtzgesagt's way of telling you only talk bulls***, Jerry."
1,"What if used to have lots of friends, and decided I like being alone doing cool stuff more, and having people around gets in the way?"
1,"Casual time is not available to those who have full time jobs, making it less likely to maintain relationships."
1,Sometimes the timing and topic of your videos... Are you spying on me?
1,bro I'm so scared. I used to hate school now it's the only thing that's keeping me together. I don't know what I will do with myself when I graduate. I'm scared I will lose all my friends and won't be able to find new ones
1,"Can u plz make a video on how to maintain ur frds, I have made frds but don't know which one wants me to grow really and which wants to drag me, plz help"
1,Kurzgesagt making all these videos that hit hard to my life... thank you...
1,Get off/stay off social media and meet real people like normal people.  Problem solved.
1, when the animators play Catan and decide to put this in the next Kurzgesagt video
2,"I want to make friends,but there is almost no one for me to *want* to befriend."
1,"this doesnt take into account that teens r  mean lmao, whenevrr im friendly and try to get close to ppl my age they r so mean and blatantly dont wanna pursue friendshios wirh me :/ idk what to do"
1,What a beautiful video. The animation and info was top notch. Thank you team for it!
1,"tbh i dont feel lonely, i got family that cares for me, i got frens online, who care about me despite if we were to ever pass each other irl we'd probably never know it, atleast some of em"
1,I feel that social media has made us lonely by increasing our expectations of social interactions. People are now expecting social interaction with anything they do.
1,"everything is wrong, real doesn't work like that. even If you get friends they will not be actual friends."
1,"The whole meetup thing is honestly one of the sweetest things I've seen held in such a long time. I took a peek into the thread for my local area and was grinning so hard at how many people were throwing out fun ideas to just get to see each other. In this day and age its easy to forget that people can just be super kinda and willing to meet with total strangers just for the fun of it! I've been struggling with this need to get out and do things again after nearly three years of keeping away from public settings, so watching this really made my night. This really is one of my fav youtube channels. Thank you Kurzgesagt!"
1,"I suffer from loneliness and hopelessness in making new friends. I feel that the fear of rejection from other dominates me a lot. I've been bullied in my childhood, so I grew as a shy person. I excelled in school and at my work as well now, but I feel I've failed in life crying_face"
1,A literal Vibe check 
1,Just texted my friends after a month or two… or three?

1,"Damn, I low-key feel like my workplace deliberately posted this to force us all back into the office!"
2,GREAT thumbs_up VIDEO video_camera
1,"uhh cant say i can relate at all... My absolute favourite thing is reading, and i would take it over anything else, if not work i would spend most of my time not interacting with anyone, being alone is so comforting, yet i cant say im introverted, i have no issue with going out and such, i just rather relax and read. I also enjoy metal and rock music, and i like spicy food as well, so either the studies arent exsacly precise or i am very different, which with so many humans in the world is super unlikely."
1,When i moved to another place i already forgot my childhood friends. And i regret it so much. I cant even find them anymore or know their full names. And i want to ask how they doing and ask me how's my life....
2,"I really love what you do, guys!
Thanks for everything you do!"
2,Thanks for defining this 'friends' entity.
1,"When I was younger, I had a LOT of friends, but as the pandemic hit, it made me realize that they were all fake. They didn’t care anymore and I knew I was just an idiot. I became homeschooled and had no friends and when I tried to make some, It didn’t end up too well. (It’s extremely personal) Since I kept failing, I got discouraged, I decided to stop trying to make friends. Thank you for showing me this video however! I think I may try to make friends now."
2,I don’t need friends when I got family
1,"I am 40 and I live in Moscow and I do not speak Russian. I have tried making friends here, but I have been exploited. Now, I am a content loner and I exercise, read and chill."
1,Why does the video assume everyone has fee friends
1,Are you kidding me? I'm here overthinking about my social life and now this shows up.
1,It's tough making friends when you're anglo and the city you live in is 95% hispanic. You're just never accepted.

1, try getting rejected quite a few times by dif people ; it'll sting for more than just a few hours :/
1,god damn this channel keeps calling me out chill fr
1,The last video that I watched was literally about making friends.
1,This video doesn’t show you how to get GF
1,"Friends are overrated.  Proof?  The video just said we don't prioritize them.  If the benefit of having friends is clearly better than the cost, we would give them higher priority.  I hate to reduce friendship into economic terms, but I find that is what most people seeking friends do.  They consider what sort of favors you can provide them, like helping them to move because you have a car.  Or, another often seen case, they want ugly friends or dumber friends so that they are the star of their clique.  Having friends based on you being you is sadly rare.  And these days something only a dog provides, and possibly your relatives.



Instead, have acquaintances.  You can get these easily with social meetup apps.  Acquaintances tend to respect boundaries more.  And there is no hurt feelings if you haven't seen your acquaintances in awhile, catching up is often a pleasant lunch or dinner.  They also fit into your busy schedule much better."
1,"So much bad advice in this video all I can say is, What absolute BS. Usually a fan of Kurzgesagt but they definitely dropped the ball on this one. Sounds like they Googled 'how to make friends'  and read from the list of results. The Title is misleading and does not touch on the 'Why' side of things, only giving a generic list of activities for people to do, ignoring the route cause or reasoning of the situation in the first place. Hope no one takes this seriously or they will be very disappointed in the real world."
1,Jurassic Park or Jurassic duck
2,I’ve been so worried about myself I haven’t thought about checking on my friends. I should do that.
1,"Nah, you don't need friends neither meet people, you're good for yourself they'll only slow you down, keep grinding and never look back at stupid things like relationship"
1,Taking a gap semester from college because I felt very alone even with social networks. Can’t believe this video came out so soon after that decision
2,I'm scared to make friends because every one I've really cared about just lost interest. I think I'm better off just staying inside.
1," : ""I have an armpit fetish"""
1,"""You're perfectly average."" 
I feel attacked.

""Open up a little.""
- I buried a corpse in my yard last night. Wanna see?"
1,"I have a small circle of friends of 4 with me included, .....since, high school, we know each other from top to bottom like a book and we love that, we find it tiring at out age now 32 33...to find new people ,we cand even thing about it ..."
1,Why I'm lonely? because I get rejected by females for trying to open up about me.
1,"This really came out at an interesting time for me. I've pretty much hit rock bottom after being lonely most of my life and no longing having the default interactions associated with highschool/college to be some facsimile of connection. As cheesy as it is to say, the world and all of its activities are pale without someone to share it with. My depression and anxiety are always far worse when I don't have someone to talk to. I've genuinely felt my mental and physical health decline over the years despite regular exercise and I know it's because of constant loneliness. 

I'm going to make this video the catalyst I needed to turn my life around. Start interacting with people despite my social problems, hang onto friendships better, do a better job of finding people. I encourage anyone in the same boat to do the same."
2,I don’t have any friends because I don’t socialize
1,"Really? not talking much makes people more sympathetic?,  In my experience its been the opposite."
1,"thank you!! I'm transitioning into the very early stages of adult life now and adult friendships are HARD - everyone's so busy! this has refocused my brain to a few things I can do to improve my friendships and potentially start new ones! I feel like the ""care less and you'll get more"" thing is something I needed to hear. Loneliness makes you desperate to get a best friend as soon as possible but I get now that friendships just need to grow and they will with effort and time. For now, I'll enjoy the experience getting to know people!"
1,"I feel like it's a huge mixture of things that prevent people from reaching out. 
The most common i've tken notice is being too busy/not having more social battery than for work. With the internet and seeing so many types of poeple, I feel like some people even build what an ideal friend for them would look like based on what they expose themselves to and it could be so unrealistic that you wouldn't be able to connect with others at all. With so many wanting to be unique, there are also some who prefer to only have someone that's very much like them or not at all. You never truly find people who are 100% compatible and I've met my share of people who will judge the smallest things about a person that doesn't even hurt them or others in any way.
For me, it has been rejection anxiety from being rejected so many times from the countless schools I've moved to. I've had to learn to adapt to the diversity of people with moving likely to more than 20 schools in my childhood. So many people don't really want to make new friends if they're content with what they already have and it could feel like you aren't good enough to fit in their group. I've also noticed that some people also prefer in person connection vs texting and calling since reading body language and tone are far more important than just words alone. I was not really allowed to go to social events or have anyone over due to my parents social phobia which really just worsened my ability to connect. I am learning more now about the importance of connection. It's hard to trust others that feel so different than you and what could be read as safe or unsafe. Some also I've seen always waiting for others to be the one to take initiative but I feel like so many people do this that most don't end up connecting even as acquaintances. Sometimes I fear what i share will potentially hurt or harm others since there are also trauma related factors for people and others with a far more sensitive personalities than average and it could be hard to put yourself out there when you don't want any form of negative confrontation. This is my long take on it. I repeated some things from the vid but that's ok, this was made to also process how I feel on the matter."
1,MAKE MORE SPACE VIDEOS I NEED MORE SPACE KNOWLEDGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Who else here feel like they’re always the one reaching out raised_hand

1," This bit hits especially hard when while I was still super introverted, I got adopted by one said central hub, and then years later when we went to university, went separate ways and I had to start from zero, I don't feel like I have a friend as close as them currently, but I at least made some friends on my own"
1,You just told me to touch grass.
1,"I like memes, science, anime, cats, mythology, scp stuff, and various other things. I'm a long haired gamer boy with the personality of a cat. Get at me lol."
1,"I've had such long-term trouble making and keeping friends that I just expect people to leave and I can tell I'm self-sabotaging and ""leaving before they can leave me"" sometimes but i feel like I don't know how to connect anymore. 

you're absolutely right, though. going out and doing things and meeting people face to face is a world of difference. but all of my hobbies/interests are solo, indoor activities and I have social anxiety and depression making it really hard to ""put myself out there."" Where do I go? I'm really hoping to get a job with a physical location so I can make connections that way, now that I've graduated college. (Not having my driver's license makes that really difficult...)"
1,That was beautiful
0,Is this a targeted attack on me?
1,I just searched how to make new friends.. I am being lonely in my entire life.. performing_arts
1,What happens if you are too sick and have a health issue that prevents you from being with friends? What's your advice?
1,I feel like the more advanced and connected society are. The more distinct each human between one another
1,There’s absolutely zero science in this
1,dunno if this could help my anxiety to start and sustain small talk but glad this video is not an existensial crisis
1,"Just so we're clear, this wasn't recommended to me nor did I search it... I swear I was just subscribed."
1,Please translate to Japanese
1,1st step... alright I'll try here. Would anyone like to be friends? I like video games and anime but also nature and learning and science just to share a few things.
1,"Just curious, anyone else had friends bail on them because they got into a romantic relationship?  This has happened to me multiple times, and I have tried to reach out to them regularly, tried to schedule things, but nope, romance is everything now, bye"
1,"Thanks kurzgesagt, I watch the German and the English version every time"
1,"Loneliness occurs when feelings of loneliness and uncomfortable social isolation go on for a long period of time. It's characterized by constant and unrelenting feelings of being alone, separated or divided from others, and an inability to connect on a deeper level."
2,Good timing
1,I'm sending this video to my friends smiling_face_with_tear
1,I love how this channel can make some of the most depressing / pessimistic stuff and then make some of the most wholesome stuff simultaneously.
1,I almost cry watching this especially knowing how much I've been struggle to meet new friends. It's such a wonderful video. I really do need this.
1,So am I the weirdo for genuinely NOT wanting to form connections and letting old ones decay? Having friends was fun when I was young but these days it's just inviting drama.
0,thanks for fueling my depression! <3
2,I feel like this is targeted at me
1,The video seems to imply that aloneness is the same as loneliness. Not everybody desires other people's company.
1,"The thing about joining groups, that I've found from personal experience, is most groups take whatever they're doing seriously, and it's all they talk about. A good example of this would be a football or hockey team, everyone there takes the game seriously, and if you're not as good as them, they will dislike your presence because you weigh down the team.

There are some groups, like hiking or gardening, where being competitive isn't an issue, but the problem with these groups is when there's a lack of competitive unification, there's an increase in small talk and the need to be interesting, otherwise you'll just be ignored. These groups are hard because if you're not an outgoing person, it will be hard for people to find your interests, and eventually try talking to you.

A good guaranteed way to make friends, is to join the Military. Because all of the people there are newbies like you, and they're all stuck in confined spaces, like you. You literally get assigned your own battle buddy, for Christ's sake!

So I'd say a good non military way to make friends, is to find a non competitive environment, where most people there are trying something/learning new. Because you all share the same attribute of not knowing whatever the hell you're doing! A few examples: Paintbal, airsoft, online multiplayer games, archery, painting classes, book clubs, the gym, etc. If you don't know what you're doing, then try to bond with the other people who don't know what they're doing. Or, if you do know what you're doing, try to bond with people who don't know what they're doing!"
1,So the reason why I don't have friends is because I don't bother to put time or effort mannn I guess I got to stop being lazy then again I get anxious whenever I talk to someone
1,Introverts: I don't have that kind of problem smirking_face.

1,"As a Korean. It’s really hard to get close to new people. 2022.Aug. 

Am I the only one who is stranger in Korea?
When I sit Next my neighbor they are watching their phone. They don’t begin to talk with new relationship.
May be I am not funny 
May be My wallet is not rich 
May be I am not good looking 

That’s why they don’t want to talk 
They cut off their relationships.

I felt that they are stacking big block on their life.


I am talking about typical peoples
As a factory worker. 
As a weekend delivery man.

 
My country has been soaked with full
of anger. 

My nation has been vomited interest of the other person.

My town has been light out with beginning of love. 

Honestly not at all. Around 17.5% peoples are get those threes. 
Especially young peoples.  

Who has been create this Idea? 
Who has been propaganda these Idea?

I guess that it has been created through out journalism. 
Who is behind the journalism? 
The power chasers.
They may want this systems. 


I am gonna tell typical examples of how hard to get make new friend. 

When I get interest to people.
I ask them as friend. 
But People felt chuckle.
So i felt embarrassed.
I decided to donnot interest to the other person.  

When I asked question what I wonder.
People vomit the anger with their eyes 
So i felt embarrassed.
I decided to donnot have a question what I wonder. 


When I had mistake. People use my dumb ass mistake as funny topic. 
For their superior feeling.


What I experience is not explaining the every world. It could be small part of The world.

But stacking theses three experience makes me feel tired to make new friend in S.Korea.


This video clip lead me into new direction and encouragement.

But I think collecting relation failure mission.
Collecting failure experience.
Those two things are Makes me sick with beginning of new relationship. 

Hopeless feeling is still hiding in my hope.
I will try again shit.."

1,"Just remember the politicians and governments that did this to you and your children. The lockdowns literally did more harm than good to peoples' health. Studies even show that more people died from the social and drug issues, and lack of seeking health checkups, than would have probably died had we not locked down."
0,I had a friend once. He died.
1,Just give up.
1,"I would rather see a video with a title ""Why you don't need friends and how to stop feeling lonely"""
1,"Meeting new people or making friends has always been hard for me because I don't put myself out there enough. My co-workers at my job are a bunch of seniors in their 60's who mostly talk about their health or their upcoming retirement, so I could never find a longstanding connection. It wasn't until I did some volunteer work at a little store nearby where I met people my age who I've become aquaintances with. I guess that now, I'm just struggling to perserve that connection because I can't even bring myself to contact them for fear of being overbearing. But, I suppose that just like this video said, I gotta reach out and figure out ways to spend more time with them. This is a serious commitment when we don't see each other during store hours."
1,"thanks youtube recommended, you’ve managed to give something other than a 10 second shit post"
1,are they NFTs though?
1,I don’t think I’ll ever be able to make friends …

1,"No
I'd rather die first than deal with human beings jaja."
1,"I've always been an introvert and a socially awkward guy. But since I was trying my best to make friends, I found a group who understood me. We've been together (all 5 of us) for years now. They gave me the confidence to be an ambivert that I am today."
1,"Yes but what if I actually DON'T care, what if I avoid people as much as I can... How do I understand if there's something wrong with me? ""Humans are hard-wired to seek social connections"", am I therefore ""not human"" enough?"

2,Why you call me out like that
1,"This is relevant for family too.

I've been drifting away from my sisters, and this will help a lot."
1,"What if no matter what you do. You just cannot make friends or getting along with people?
It ain’t like I try to be offensive or do anything to make enemies.
I just seem to have a target on my back.
Like the other day. I asked a security gaurd a question by saying,
Excuse me sir, I cannot grab the trailer that you assigned me. Would it be possible to unlock the gate so I can get that trailer.
The security guard unloaded on me. I felt so threatened that I place my hand in my gun. That was concealed underneath my shirt.
Thankfully I was able to talk him down.
I have lost so much because of this problem.
I have had 77 jobs in my life. Absolutely no stability what so ever.
I’m 39, never have been married or have children.
I literally witnessed an elderly neighbor die alone in his home because nobody gave a damn about him. I fear that will be my fate.
I would have helped him but he would always end up cussing me out. So I just avoided him.
It’s so bad that I have to carry weapons with me everywhere I go. Cannot tell you how many fights I’ve been in because people have attacked me.
I learned real quick to avoid large venues and in a restaurant always sit in a corner next to an exit.
I wish I had a normal life.face_holding_back_tearssmiling_face_with_tear"

1,Been in and out of the hospital. I have migraines and have been out of in person school for years. Hard making friends because I’m always in pain. Anytime I go out to see someone I have to leave because of the pain. I’m 15 and getting new treatment next week. Really exited; thanks for this video

I love them, they're the best, but I wish I had a bigger group, that everybody was chill, and wouldn't put me all alone in the group."

2,bro i just want a real and close friend
2,I joined a lightsaber dueling group. BAM! Instant friends!
1,"Probably everyone has posted something similar already, but this video feels like it was made for me right in this moment of my life.

Thank you so much, Kurzgesagt Team! This is truly helpful!"
1,"A problem that comes with age is that you may find that your friends have differences in opinions. At school or university you share same interests but later in life some people stick to the past and others change with the present. For me it is very difficult to be with friends who stay in the past. So I am losing my friends , and the older you get the more difficult it is to make new friends."
1,As someone with autism this is even more hard... XD
0,the problem with strangers is that most of them suck... why would i want to be friends with someone who sucks?
1,Trying hard to supress the urge to watch through the video so I can contine being lonely and complain about it.

1,We should all like this video so it is reccomened to everyone on youtube
1,"Time to dust of those space marines, I guess?.."
1,"Two reasons came to mind on why it's harder to make friends: 

1) We've normalized being anti-social. People are like ""Hanging out? Nah, being at home and watching Netflix >>>"" Nothing wrong with alone time of course, but it's made me sometimes feel crazy about wanting to spend time with people. Don't use ""I'm introverted"" as an excuse to being a negligent friend. 

2) Friendships are hard when you're the better friend. Yeah, I might sound full of myself, but I believe I am a better friend than most/all of my friends. They don't deserve me face_with_rolling_eyesnail_polish. 

Side note: Kurzgesagt's animation is the most blessed/cursed thing in the world."

1,"I’ve done everything in this video but am still chronically lonely. Joined groups, tried to hang out with colleagues, hosted parties and meetups, never turn down the rare invitation. I’ve really tried, but I still feel completely alone. I don’t think I’ve ever had a reciprocal relationship. If I want to see a friend, it’s always me reaching out. It’s led me to a very dark place mentally. I feel like a failure, a screw up. I feel like I’m too different for anyone to like me, but I can’t pinpoint specifically in what way. I feel like I’m the perfect combination of vices to make a definitively unlovable person. I’m sorry if I sound like a mope or attention seeker - that is not my intention, but this is honestly how I feel."
1,"Kurzgezagt: ""why are you lonely and how to make friends""
Me: How did you read my mind!!!"
1,What if even though you have them you still feel lonely
1,"I literally started crying because of how right this vid is, i feel like i try very hard to go out Irl, but so many people are busy that i end up finding myself very loney, def gonna try to take some of this advice"
1,The thing is im autistic so its harder for me to make friends. People think my interests are weird and im “uncanny” in their words
2,Friends are for the weak minded
1,i live in a society where money has more value than relationships. So you know it's not easy for me.
0,This on my recommendation hurts me a little
1,3 years later I get a Part 2
1,"As a lonely, single, unsociable, depressed, autistic type, erm, yeah, I'm apparently destined to die alone and probably soon at this rate, yay............. :\"
1,"All in all, well... I know why I spent my time lonely and I know that I know how to make friends too. The thing is... most people aren't worth it. Me included, for the most. I really have trouble seeing the merit in building friendship just for the sake of it as I approach my 30s. Practical, professional relationships? Those are a must, inarguably."
1,"People around me don't fit with me. What they like and what I like are different. How do they talk and how do I talk also different. More worst, they start to toxic to me. Honestly, I am loneliest person on earth confirm. Anyways I have no siblings and no friends. I still have Allah and my mother to talk with lol. I already been so lonely since I was kid. Maybe I just too arrogant."

1,"OK but what about the polar opposite - how to respectfully disconnect from people you don't have a connection with anymore when you've found your people, ie through social media, discord, video games, etc."
2,this helped me make friends
1,"Well, as an autism myself, I find it difficult to mix with my peers, because my personal preferences are very very different. Often time, even if I tried, many would just try to abuse the relationship. Guess I'll just didn't meet the one that truly cares yet."
1,The fact that this video was uploaded 11h ago and got 1.2 milion viewers is just sad
2,Very nice video have a great day and do some stuff and be happy
1,"between 12-16 i was more introverted, but had groups of friends i could talk to whenever i wanted to, now that im almost 18 i have 2-3 friends at a time and miss being able to have a group of people that all know each other, i miss being a part of that. Im heading into a new foundation course this year, and theres new people coming into the college i go to for it, and i am so exited not only because i can meet a new group of people, but also because getting into this course means i can go to university, and meet even more people"
1,"After watching this I looked around in my town for volunteer work I could do in order to get out of my usual bubble of family and coworkers. I found a group of really nice people at the local Tafel, a food saving and distribution organisation for which I now sometimes drive tours on saturday morning picking up leftover food, sorting it and bringing it in. I've met a few really interesting people through that so far, among them a former syrian refugee that wants to give back and a pensioneer that actually worked at the same company as I do currently. People were pretty welcoming, possibly also because it became apparent to me in what dire need they are for younger people participating.
There's plenty similar organisations that look for people that want to contribute, and most of these activities take less time than you think. Check around, usually the city administration hosts postings by such organisations. Maybe there's something you'd enjoy"

Also sucks that the meeting thing is on Reddit since I'm permabanned from there due to being too hostile towards fascists... But I guess nobody just likes ""leftist extremists"" and ""angry feminists"" so I'm honestly not having too high hopes of meeting new friends in more generic situations anyways."

I stay up all night, just to spend creative hours after everyone has gone to sleep and the requests quiet down and the phone stops ringing.  I don't feel like I need anyones approval or help, and I don't care about ""leaving a legacy"", but try to be honest about whether or not Im just kidding myself.  I have no interest in ""popularity contests"" or ""competition"".  The truth is, Im drowning in people constantly and greatly value the fleeting moments when my life is simple and quiet.  Maybe there's someone out there who needs to hear this."
1,"I keep switching schools over and over, and most times they were people with who had common interests with me and naturally became friends or those who for some reason are the most friendliest human beings to me, but I'm never complaining lol. Now that I switched schools for the 4th time now I feel like recess is a hell I need to endure for 20 minutes without my phone (phones not allowed) + almost everyone in the classroom knows each other while I'm the only one new."

1,"I've been struggling with loneliness these past 10 years and I just lost my circle gradually over the past 3 years. Even though I already have a wife, but things still haunt me till now, somethings just feel not right.
I am an introvert but I really yearn for meaningful friendship. I had them, but when I lost them, It really shattered me personally 
Your video just dropped at the right timing.
It may not be the exact answer, but I could systematically try to analyze why I felt this way
Thank you"
1,"I am an extrovert who had a lot of 'friends',eventually realized this ""friendship"" as society refers to is nothing more than a mutually beneficial  relation or simply a business  partnership.

Once one of the side stops profiting off of it,they simply bounces away.

Been feeling a lot of bit  lonely recently,
it had been like as if I am the one who has to uphold the friendship at the cost of my own peace everytime.

So,I decided to accompany myself from now on.I mean who would be with me in my grave anywaygrinning_face_with_sweat,so what even is the point of yearning for a friendship when I am alive."
1,no you can't just pesonaly attack me
1,"It’s funny. When I had 10-15 friends I felt lonely. Over the pandemic (and telling most of my friends I am not in fact gay lmao) it’s been whittled down to one friend. I’ve read up on stoicism, progressed in therapy. And now, after several years of being depressed, lonely, anxious and low self-esteem, I’m happy. I’m not lonely even though I have one and only one best friend. Self-improvement worked for me, but the beauty of loneliness and sadness is there’s almost an infinite number of ways to cure them. If anyone read this who feels lonely, sad, or any of that. You will be better, you will find a way."
2,Thanks for the subreddit red_heart
1,I wouldn't say I am lonely. I am happy being by myself and working towards my goals but I wouldn't mind a few more friends
1,"True story,

Earlier today when I was driving to work and my dad continued to ‘Backseat’ the entire journey. (I am still on provisional and my test is roughly 16 days away) he kept telling me that I was too aggressive and despite me saying I clearly wasn’t, he argued even more because he could tell by the way I drove which was no different to how I drove normally, plus I had several new hazards to deal with that I tackled brilliantly. 

Usually he just does this to have something to grumble about so he cannot say I am perfect, which is what he is looking for. He even had the cheek to say, “Don’t look at me, I don’t have anything to prove, you do!” 
When I arrived at work. That pissed me off so much that I’ve been in a pissed off mood all day and got very snappy towards some of the people from work. I relent from saying ‘friends’ because the security at work have said to me countless times that the people at where I work are not really my friends after 2 plus years keeping people safe from Covid-19.

I think it worked on my mind to such an extent that I have begun to actively resent the people I usually interact with at work. One colleague for example when she passed and I asked if I could help her, turned to me and had the fucking cheek to say to me, “Did I say I wanted your help?”

I chipped two teeth because I gritted them so hard because she said that to me. Never in 4 years had anyone talked to me in that way, I was shocked and appalled. After that I’ve literally not said a word to anyone, as far as I was concerned they could all fuck off and die. I’ve had plenty of mates before who fucked off and I’ve never seen again. I’ve also been friends with people for years who once school was done have yet to speak to me to this day. 

But on the other hand, perhaps the opposite of that is true, maybe they are just busy or moved on etc. 

But that sets a depressing idea that was I simply just a burden to people who they put up with and then cut all ties as though they no longer acknowledged my existence. That sort of thing destroys a man’s self-confidence so much that it’s no wonder I’m so angry and spiteful, they don’t fucking care about my feelings and start dictating to me how I should feel.

And again, it’s not as if they don’t care, maybe it’s just the tough love treatment, but even those that do are at least polite enough to listen. 

My problem sometimes is that I’ve made friends with not really very friendly people at all."

1,"Look guys the title ""why you are lonely"" is maybe too much no? I've seen the video and there's a lot of great stuff in there but why send that particular notification to a subscriber? Have you considered this scenario: a subscriber is mentally unstable.. you have just reinforced something that they may have been battling against and it could have a major impact on them. Being lonely is not the same as being alone.

Many humans are entirely capable of living full healthy lives without friends or family. Social groups are the norm but not always essential. Extremely introverted people are entirely satisfied with their own company and nearly everything that was said in your video does not apply.

Don't get me wrong, friends are great but don't make out that living a solitary life is torture because it doesn't have to be. Practice meditation every day, reflect on the natural world.. the funny thing is that often once you renounce friendship and companionship they will appear!"

1,"Im capable of making friends. I have so many friends im not actually alone I just dont like making friends because I feel like a target for every friend I make. I feel like i'm surrounded by people who are going to harm me at any second I feel unsafe around them even if they might be nice and im overly observant of new people. Its like theyre not actually there and the question I always ask, ""why does everyone always leave? Am I really a bad person...is it me?"""

This makes it difficult for me to comunicate with those around me since they might think i'm english and don't know norwegian. I've tried to speak more norwegian and get fluent in it again but there are so many words i've only learnt in english, even though i can speak norwegian fluently. My biggest problem is people just not understanding me since i might end up talking very quickly at times."

1,"""the main reason is that most people don't prioritize relationships enough""?? no. nice graphic design can't cover up for the terrible neoliberal analysis in this video. we are lonely because capitalism is alienating us from our lives and commodifying everything we do while destroying the environment. feeling lonely is a fucking rational reaction - why should we suppress it and pretend that it's our fault? the insidious advice in this video reminds me of thinking that ""social media addiction"" is an objective concept, instead of a convenient way to obscure that unregulated tech companies are very consciously creating addictive technologies and sucking the life out of average people to sell ads and make money...in other words, your loneliness is a POLITICAL problem, not a personal deficiency."

Thank you for making this video from the bottom of my heart!! Very helpful!!!"
1,"I wish you'd have uploaded this years ago!! I remember being alone for so long. I moved to a new school in the fifth grade and for the longest time it seemed like everyone saw me as weird when I did nothing wrong. They would treat everyone one way and then look at me weird or something. In middle school this only got worse. People were giving me the silent treatment or bullying me or telling me that no one likes me because I'm too talkative and quirky. I did have a girlfriend but she ended up turning bad and telling me I'm worthless. People also used and manipulated me. In high school people mainly wanted to talk to me bc I was smart so I could help them with work and because I had snacks a lot. I had some friends through all this time but it just didn't seem like enough and they weren't close enough. For one, his parents were too strict, but for the most part I was never INVITED to like parties and stuff, never exclusively included.
I grew very distrustful of human beings and fell into a depression for a while. I went from the loud, excited kid, to the shelled up quiet one who was the utmost uncomfortable to be around others. I always expected the same results, according to what had happened in the past; the people get to know me for a few hours or days, then after that they start treating me just like everyone else. There was never an issue with me, my family and my teachers agreed on that. It was only just people in my generation.
Luckily, I finally found a good friend during my freshmen year, and now we're still very good friends even as I begin college this fall. He is a real blessing. Through him, I was able to meet another friend I now hold dear. Via Instagram, I've met tons of other friends and we hope to meet someday. I began to think that hm, maybe I'm not the ONLY one in the ENTIRE WORLD who is so unique like this and stands out from everyone else. Even then, I still have a lot of work to do. In real life, I still don't have many friends and I don't really at my new college (SCAD). I want to learn to open up again and not expect the worst in people as I normally do. It's truly about finding your people. Never give up you guys!! And if you need a friend I'm happy to support.

1,"Making friends in school was NOT easy.  It was impossible.  It was a hostile environment where noone liked me and I was bullied and called a communist (I to this day am not into politics, so not sure why just because I was born in Ukraine, that kids would automatically assume that I involved myself in politics at the age of 7 and became a communist. That makes NO SENSE). I utterly despised school and wished for the destruction of it and its inhabitants. When I was in high school, I used to celebrate April 20th - columbine school shooting day (these days I also celebrate 4/20, but for different reasons grinning_face_with_smiling_eyesgrinning_face_with_smiling_eyes) and would walk around the halls and tell the teachers ""happy school shooting day!"" and isolated myself as much as possible. I stayed at home on my computer. When kids got in trouble, they were grounded.  When I got in trouble, my mom made me go outside.  So I went outside and waited until it was ok to return and went right back in.
A strong mushroom trip made me realize I was using hatred to cover up for my insecurities and percieved inadequacies, and I stopped being hateful.  That's when I realized that I would really love to play with some boobs.  I was completely and utterly unprepared to gain access to a girl, as I didn't have the first clue as to how that works.
I had to learn about eye contact, conversations, how to start speaking to people, smiling, body language, touching (and the escalation of touching), nonverbal communication, rapport, the various stages of the courtship process, etc.  While computer programming was easy, learning to socialize (especially with a girl) was supremely complicated and took YEARS AND YEARS to finally understand.  So much theory and procedures and behaviors and attitudes to emulate.. it was so overwhelming at first.  But eventually I finally started to understand the process and gain insight and even began to comprehend it better than ""regular"" people.  The Army also fixed my posture and I stood up and walked straight.  Finally, I began to succeed, and the momentum grew.
I recently found out that I am on the spectrum. Not the electromagnetic spectrum (I'm on that too grinning_squinting_face), but the autism spectrum.  Now it all makes sense.  Now I understand why I had to break down a social interaction into a bunch of different variables, actions, behaviors, and procedures in order to understand WTF is going on.
That wasn't the end of it though.  After finally learning about women, I then had to learn about being selective with women, to value myself. To deal with and avoid toxicity and mistreatment, etc.  The first 8 or so were pretty crazy, and I endured a lot of mistreatment and abuse. The next 5 were a step up, but not by much. The few after that were the turning points. Though it was really only the longterm ones that were toxic, the short-term and overnight ones were.. intoxicated (as was I).
Quitting heroin, coke, crack, and later crystal meth also wasn't easy, but it allowed me to distance myself from those kinda women. It was only very recently, after I came back from prison for forging drivers licenses for the Russian Mafia (google my name), I met a girl who I saved from an abusive relationship and showed her how a real woman should be treated.  I made her feel so good about herself that she left me.  I taught her to value herself but didn't teach her to value me.  I was very excited about the breakup, as I was happy that I helped her elevate herself.  It was at that point that I really had to change my standards, and eventually I started dropping women left and right for disrespecting me or for being toxic, etc.  And that's when I met someone who I didn't think could exist.  The kindest and most understanding person i've ever met.  She was so kind to me that it made me cry. There's never been any toxicity, and the communication was so good that I was baffled, and started learning from her.  This hasn't happened before. Even with sex, I always had to be the teacher.  This one taught me a whole shitload of things, including spots I've never heard of before (a spot, o spot, u spot), and she has this crazy technique that gave me a 30-minute orgasm.  Definitely a very special woman.  After so many fucked up girlfriends and a VERY fucked up wife who became quite the crackhead, I finally met someone who matched up the imaginary ideal woman that I was designing in my mind for decades.  Though we see each other regularly and have feelings for each other, she is not my girlfriend.  Rather, we are in an ethically-non-monogamous intimate friendship.  This came with a whole stack of new things to learn, but it is so great.  We don't (and don't try to) own each other (except for in a bdsm context), we see whoever else we want (though with agreed-upon boundaries and expectations), and it's so much fun.  Out of all the women I have known, this is my one true friend and I love her for that.

Friends are very important to have."

1,"I’m starting to think I’m on the spectrum and may be more than just introverted… I don’t have, nor feel the need to maintain a bunch of friends. I’m happy to be around my fiancé, and go to see my immediate family. I have a few friends from high school and we message each other like once every few months, but they don’t care, that’s what they prefer as well lol. Maybe it’s a young generation thing, but I don’t really think so. Being alone and being lonely are two different things. I just like being alone… it heals me from all the ignorance that occurs when humans are in groups."

1,so loneliness is associated with a shorter live? is that a promise? I can't deal with more false hope.
1,Why you violating me
1,I haven’t watched the video yet but I read what it’s about on instagram. And I just wanna get it out of my chest that my friend of 11 years is moving away to another continent this October. He is literally the most important person in my life and it just feels so bad that I can’t do anything to change this.
1,"Part of the problem, is people need to turn off their stupid phones, and go make some poor choices out in the world.
Can’t tell you how many times I try to get people to live life — but they won’t do shit.
This is especially true the older you get. People think if they aren’t 18 anymore then life is over, and they just have to slowly wait around to die.
Makes me so angry and frustrated.
Get out of your houses people — go to the mall, go to the library, go see live music, go to a museum, volunteer, hell, go buy some drugs and be wild!
Life is almost over for all of us, and you’re wasting it on twitter, and Facebook!"
2,Amazing. Thank you. Who wants to hang out? grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes
2,I am concerned about why this was recommended to me
1,"I moved far away from my home town a little over a year ago and have had massive issues making any friends, it doesn’t seem to matter how much I try no one ever has any time for me and the few connections I have made have just flamed out entirely
I don’t think I’ve ever felt this alone in my whole life and I don’t really know what to do about it anymore, it all feels rather hopeless"
1,Sounds easy. If only I could have some thousand dollars so i would not have to work two works to make it through......maybe then i would have time to just hang around with others in other surroundings and not business meetings
1,Did he change the name of the video?
1,"I’m 28, autistic, and only have a small group of friends online and one friend IRL, but they’re too busy to hang out regularly.

I want to make friends outside the internet, but it feels like I’ve missed my chance. Once people make their social groups in school, they don’t want to bother with you and focus more on their work.

I tried to go on a date via an app but got scammed because I was too stupid and desperate to realize what they were doing to me. How am I supposed to meet new people when no one wants to open up and most dating and social apps scam you?

If there really is an app for meeting new people that isn’t a scam, I’m all ears. But until then, I’ll be forever alone ;3;"
2,Yeah and they'd just use you and then dump you... no thanks
1,"Looping through having friends then losing them after a while, gives me the sensation of just staying away on the process of making one."
2,Wow this is such a feel good video! I have a small group of friends but this helped remind me to invest in this group. I think I don’t do that enough. Thank you kurzgesagt!

So if you have older relatives and no friends, go to them and talk a bit, maybe there is someone handicapped in your area that need help, you may try talk to them. We often exclude folk from our friendship groups for we are age-phobic, abelist and sometime just racist."

1,"I can't hang out with anyone because I have no money, I can't afford anything. You can only go on so many nature walks and I want to have at least some spending money. I don't want to just do things that are free, everything fun costs more than I have. I never have cash in my wallet because there's no point, everything I get disappears immediately. 

I can't figure out how to make money, so I just feel like a burden and the few friends I do have, have to send me money just so I can get by. All of them are online, I've never had an irl friendship last and I'm not sure I even want to. I don't feel like I'm worth anyone's time among other things.

Tbh I just wanna die"

2,"So true, moving away really isolates friendships"
1,"Beautifully explained !!! I wonder in today's era of social media, instagram how much value does true friendship holds? I find such friendships very artificial, without even meeting the friend once in 6 months ( that's the least, I feel). That warmth, innocence,those meetings at tea joints,  genuine happiness for each other is gravely missing these days.

1,"I haven't made any real life friends since 2013. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown where everyone was quarantined? I have been living like that since a major accident in 2013 that disabled me and I've almost never left my home outside of appointments and grocery shopping since 2014. I've been extremely lonely especially during my rehab for multiple surgeries, and I live in the middle of nowhere (village of 800). The friends I did make in high school and college all stopped answering texts and coming over several years ago. 

The rather extreme isolation has taken its toll... I haven't had sex in ten years, or been on a date. Though, that stuff isn't too important to me. It's a little mindblowing though as a handsome 28 year old."
2,I have a friend that I don't talk to that much and I called him and we have a stronger relationship now!

1,You could make a lot of money at comic-con with this
1,"Okay, I wasn't sure whether I should post this without looking as the negative one, but I guess it would be better just for the record. I was on a kurzgesagt meetup ... and wasn't exactly happy with the experience. Nothing dramatic, it just wasn't fulfilling at all for me."
1,When you don't trust anyone because you've been let down many times it's kinda hard
1,"Meh. My problem is I don’t really want any friends. And for whatever reason people just love me. I think people are tedious. I’m content with my husband and our kids. My immediate family and that’s it. 

Also before anyone freaks out I just mean I don’t like being constantly invited to crap like baby showers, bachelorette parties, mani pedi crap, chicks with sticks (golfing while my “friends” get hammered on wine), I’m constantly getting added to these “mommy” groups on fb for shit like pure romance parties, or scentsy…ya know, women who think they’re “boss babes” because they bought into a pyramid scheme…as an actual business owner they’re not welcome at my table of blood sweat and tears to run a business…and they’re NOT business owners. Crap like that. I never go but people just expect me to. I don’t want to! I almost didn’t even go to my baby shower! 

Anyway, I’m sure this is aimed at younger people before they’re adults. But just hang in there. It’s not lonely for too long and tbh friends are so damn seasonal. I have a handful of people I would regard as friends. I love them, just from afar."

1,Is this Kurzgesagt biography?
1,"This video is so important. They answered the science of friendships so well. I was brought to a tear at the end. To have someone tell me, and experience, how much friendships play into your self-worth has moved me to my core.

It's better that I don't waste their time that could be best spent on becoming friends with people better than me.

1,"As an AfricanAmerican living in the US, redlining, highway displacement & other policies & effects of systemic racism, makes making friends so difficult. Racism in the US literally rewrites geography & the way cities/towns are built & changes who inhabits where. For nearly 2 decades, I’ve struggled in my kid-teen & late 20s to have friends. I once told a nice-acquaintance that “I love to learn history more than any other topic because, it makes you less prejudice, less misogynistic & less racist.” “You learn about the culture, trauma, & contributions to your nation…by peoples who don’t look like you”. Growing in the Midwest, with the rise of alt-right groups in the US & abroad in Europe, really scared me & my family. My grandmother & great grandmother knowing the pain of systemic racism, colorism, misogynior & poverty. Being displaced by racism in our car-centric infrastructure country, made it nearly impossible for me to have contact with other AfricanAmericans. The youth of my age around me, being non-AA, were difficult to have relationships with because: they didn’t understand my personal & family’s experiences with racism/misogyny, many of those people “liked me” but had no interest in learning about my peoples’ culture-contributions/experiences and the ones that knew it was the only way to truly know me (as is the case with so many AA people) couldn’t handle it before becoming defensive. The few whites, mestizo, etc kids that began to “sorta get it”, gravitated out of my life slowly, because they realized how different my life, with blackness, was from their own. I wanted to & heard all about them, but it’s hardly ever reciprocated. Apart from the truly racist, misogynistic, historically ignorant & other sinister things non-AA peers have said or have had slip out, when I meet these types of people it’s always starting from ground 1. Being in the MidWest, you learn these peoples parents passed down very ignorant views of the world on to them, I’m the same age as these kids, they ain’t gonna listen to me vs their parents influence. “Jokes” that never sound like jokes, but insecure responses to otherwise mundane information or common knowledge, in my peoples’ world. “Everything is about [Afriphobic] racism, ain’t nothin not tainted by it, even urban & suburban planing”. Could say more, but that it’s."
2,But how to keep a friend?
1,TARGET AUDIENCE HAS BEEN REACHED
1,Kurzgesagt really said “no friends pleading_face”
2,friends are overrated i rather be alone
2,I needed this.. I have no friends
1,"Quality over quantity. Pick them carefully. Don't fall into the pitfall of ""collecting"" them."
1,i can already see this in memes
1,It is much harder to get to know people living nearby when you live in a densely populated big city than when you live in a smaller town or countryside (my personal experience). But I have no idea why.
1,"The question is what about those people who are ever so busy to be friends with? They have their excuses too much work, no personal time etc? Are they not friends? How long do you give anyone benefit of doubt that they are actually busy?!"
1,I've had very few friends since the fifth grade because I had a 4 month TBI and had to retake fifth grade so I lost all friends that I had

1,"The rock climbing gym is such a great place to make friends, because climbing is a partner activity.  Rope climbing always takes at least 2 people, and even bouldering people prefer to do it together.  But the thing about making friends at the climbing gym is that you have to fucking commit to it.  Spend tons of time climbing, binge YouTube on how to get better, get super involved with it.  Because people don't want to hang out with someone who knows nothing about climbing or nothing about safety.  So you have to go super hard on it, but if you do you will meet people."

1,"I've done all the things this video has recommended, and to this day I still don't have any friends. At least, not the kind of friends I see in YouTube videos who play online games together."
1,Stop trying to seek validation from others. Find it within you... is a better advice in my opinion.
2,"What if I send this to my friend 

Wait that’s why I am watching this"
1,"Thing is... youre not telling us anything new.
But thanks for reminding us."
1,"i personally believe losing friends is a two way street. distancing in friendships can happen as long as you allow it to happen. i recently lost a really good friend because of disagreements we had. we were both in different places in life, i just started college almost 100 miles away while they were still in high school. they were convinced that i was distancing myself because i was making more friends and not talking to them as much, but instead of approaching me, they just ghosted me and never confronted me about these feelings nor updated me about their personal moments when i would check up. i took that as a sign of distancing but i kept trying my best to approach and start conversations. however, just because i was busy never meant i considered her any less of a friend than before. it was a relationship that couldn't last, and i was more than willing to step away for my mental health at that point.

all in all, friendships are a two way street and yes, distancing can happen but for the friendship to truly ""fade"", it takes two. checking up can be hard, but if they are your true friend, they won't just allow the friendship to fade because they THINK it will."
1,"I have very poor communication skill. I clutter while I speak, people can't understand what I'm saying very clearly, I always have to repeat my sentences twice. And I always feel this anxiety when someone makes eye contact. I have trouble making friends even when I share or have same interest as them."
1,"Young people suffered during the covid panic (it did not qualify as an actual pandemic) because of draconion government overreach into our schools,  jobs and personal lives.  Please put the 'blame' where it belongs.  
The main causes of the 'separation crisis' with young people are the internet and social media.  Young people have an easy alternative to real relationships (which require effort) by simply going to a digital fantasy land.  This has been going on for more than ten years and you glossed over it.  Please put the 'blame' where it belongs.
Yes, caring and sharing are vital to relationships, old and new.  Do people really not know this?   I'm naturally introverted but forced myself to be around people by getting a job as a bartender at age 23.  Turn off the TV, do not use the internet for hours each day and delete TikTok."
1,Its surprising how accurate these titles are sometimes
0,bad video being lonely is the best
1,"No. Political division, phones, dating apps pair up people at events, long distance for a job,"
1,I describe my older friend group as social ‘orbits’. They stay nearby and hang out for some time and then drift away for awhile. But they always come back around again and we are back to being super close again.

1,"I don't have friends because I can't connect to anyone.  
It used to be because people didn't want to hang out with me (You know, I make plans, they never reach out, and when we did hang out they were arrogant or patronizing or egotistic).  
But now I look at my classmates and everyone in the world and I don't want to hang out with them anyway; they all talk about such meaningless, superficial topics, the same pointless things.  
I don't think I'm better then them, I just don't share the same perspective about anything.  What a shame.  It's either their fault or mine and it's so subjective that there's no clear answer."

1,"Socializing as a kid/teen was also easier not only because of proximity, but overall cost. As an adult, building a friendship is expensive. Unless you live next door to someone, you're driving, maybe paying for parking, paying for food, paying for the activity you're doing. Often, this expense of time and money comes after work too, and speaking for myself, I just want to unwind for emailing and meeting with managers everyday. When the weekend hits, I finally have a chance to pursue my own projects, so it's almost like I barely have time for myself let alone multiple people. It just feels hard to take care of yourself and take care of the connections you form nowadays."
1,"I've always felt like I've failed to develop a healthy level of introversion. I go to groups pretty frequently, but am met with disinterest in anything beyond the group itself. I had no friends beyond an early grade in school, maybe one in college (for a single semester, as it was just before I graduated), and nothing in the workplace. People at work have actively rebuffed me even speaking to them, even when I'm between two people on my team casually talking to each other. I call and text people, but no one will respond or pick up besides my parents. I sometimes tell my counselor that I talk to him more than everyone else I know, combined. I also have medical issues that have made getting out more and more difficult, and most of the time, I'd like nothing more than to be able to call someone, but there are literally no options.

I don't know how to live like this."

1,"-become successful (interesting to others)
-self-reflect who you are (dont be an assho)
-be more open (friendship is a compromise yes there are 8 billion people in the world but you will never find a friend if you are picky)
-learn to talk or listen interactively. dont just be a wall. (this is hard, as this skill is usually learned within first decade and a half of your life, but it is still doable)


and about being more open, it's like being proud of being picky about food and unable to eat other types of cuisine. you eventually lose even more appetite as you age and life becomes dull.


try to be more interested in other things. take up new hobbies, do something new. 
this is probably the hardest part of making new friends. Many people are stubborn with their own stereotype they made for themselves. 

if parallel universes existed, there would be many versions of you where one likes rap, one likes Mozart, one likes basketball, one likes painting. You cant do all these things but try to find more of yourself."

1,My friends and I graduated from college over 10 years ago now but we still meet up and go on vacations together regularly despite the fact that most of us are married and have kids by now. People always act surprised that we've maintained the group for so long but it's like anything else you have to set time aside and make it a priority.
1,Some people need to focus on what is at home and providing for the ones that are close to us before being lonely and making Friends with strangers.
1,I feel strangely targeted by this video. I needed this.
1,This one is personal.
1,"Guys you really don’t want many friends I am a student and have almost half of the school as friends it gotten to the point that I can’t study or stay at home cuz at least one of them text me like “ wanna get lunch” or something and even if I need to study that thought will and did distract me and I can’t stay in one place by myself even if the teacher are teaching the class 

I mean yes I laugh with them a lot but after a point it get so bad you hate yourself"
2,"it may sounds stupid/insignificant, but thanks for help"
1,"Man I had a really good friendship who later prioritized everything except for our friendship because she thinks effort is not required since we know each other well. She would regularily decline invitations and I ceased to put in the effort after many attempts.  I would constantly tell her most of the things that were stated in the video, but she just never understood. Eventually I stopped because our friendship seemed extremely one-sided and it was painful to me. For a long time, I had doubts about myself and thought I was in the wrong. But thank you for this video as it reassured me that my idea of frienship wasnt wrong and put an end to my anxiety."
1,"I'm 24, I don't have any close relationships, including family.

1,Lost a friend who was with me for 10 years. It's hard to make new friends who have that quality as old ones. It will take a lot of years to build that kind of connection.  Hope I find someone.
1,"Thank you, just thank you
You have no idea how much this video means to me and it's timing couldn't have been better."
1,"I wonder how it'd be possible to expand my social circle despite knowing I'm an utterly toxic human being...but the only way to break the cycle of toxicity is by forming healthy healthy relationships and reshaping my negative perspective of the world (which is currently made of abandonment, trauma, growing up in a pretty rotten city, and  seemingly only to befriend other toxic people in my youth) into a positive perspective of the world by letting go of some of my social paranoias, negative expectations, generally negative attitude, and just be overall more comfortable around folks...all of which circles back to my inability to form positive friends in the first place. Quite the catch-22, no?"

1,"As an introverted 21 year old, I still struggle trying to make friends in college. Everywhere I see, it's either a couple (male and female) holding hands, both emotionally comforting, or just a bunch of guys or gals having a good time, cheering or playing a game together. Then there's me, casually strolling through, like a speck blowing in the breeze. The problem is, I've had trouble making friends since middle school. I only had one strong connection and that was with my parents. Which made it real hard for me to communicate with people who wasn't a part of my family. I developed social anxiety and had to be put in speech throughout Elementary and middle school. I guess you could say I pretty much wasted my life throughout grade school, and it has continued to linger through my college life. pleading_facepensive_face"

this video was an unexpected left hook. i was thinking existential/future/space/technology/environment/ etc., and all of a sudden you address my deep sad lonely life. thanks, i thought that i was alone in my loneliness, now i know that i'm not.
 
i only had one other hope, and it is the 3rd longest of shots...

my fear is that there is only one of me or a bunch. im living the fermi paradox of friends... i have a bunch of hobbies, but none that others are into. and even if we ALL joined the subreddit, none of us would show ourselves out of fear of being hurt the way we were before, or im just the only one who would join and be like me. i'll see a bunch of dnd friends and rich ppl and ppl who have as strong sense of self and a community that they can easily fall into and i'll still be alone. i'm just writing this here as my thesis. or prediction. idk."

1,Bro I am 20 and never had friends because I lost an eye at birth making me ugly and hated in all of school. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER ME KURZGESAGT? Warum
1,Can u make more vids on quantum physics
1,A Warhammer reference was the last thing I thought I'd see here. Well done.
1,"This is obviously for young people or children, Very simple way to make friends shut off all your electronic devices and go outside with your bike and ball and find a neighbor child that’s your age and would like to play"
1,"Okay, here’s a problem specific to me and every other teenager lol. Back in middle school: the sixth grade, because of some emotional issues I decided I did not want to interact with other people and I became incredibly hostile towards adults and people my age. Fast forward to today: I’m in my senior year of high school. I am no longer a “quiet kid” and I’m trying to tear down the social barriers I hid myself behind, but I’ve become so used to being asocial. I feel depression and loneliness just like everyone else watching this video, and I know what the problem is. I just can’t fall back into the healthily social rhythm the other people my age have. I am not going to give up, the worst is over, and I’m going to find a way to the best again. (I don’t recall the point I was trying to make, but now I feel determined for anything.)"
1,Kurzgesagt knows its audience
1,"In short, this video is literally telling you to go outside and meet some people as well as disconnect yourself from technology more often. No wonder my life has no purpose. unamused_face"
1,I had a friendship that was destined to be a life long one but when COVID hit he found he found new friends
1,"I'm crying right now, I feel like I don't belong. My classmates has already their own circles of friends, and me, I just have myself. I feel bad for myself"
1,"I’ve recently transferred to a new school- I know practically no one there and have only have 2 friends. This video helped me realized that I needed to see this video- to help me make a real connection with people, and help me understand that having friends is important . Thank you, Kurzgesagt. :)"
1,Heck yeah let's get called out by kurzgesagt
1,"Many modern men just don't have all that many friends and some don't have any at all.  Many regular men work long hours so just don't have much free time. When they do get home they are tired and just want to chillout with the Television or spent a little time gaming to help them unwind. Another thing that can cause a loss of friendships is divorce men end up leaving, moving location after and it doesn't help. The main thing in relationship or marriage is men go with the flow of her friends and they tend to bring their husbands and boyfriends so they are the people you end up spending time with. 

Also men tend to keep to their same groups they have had since school and college and just don't introduce or want to bring anyone new into the group your viewed as creepy and why would we want anyone new in the group we have. So more and more men just don't have friends. 

Also work colleagues are just work colleagues and you try to get along with them at work but you just can't see them as a friend, infact some or even most of them are absolute ----s that you just have to put up with 5 or 6 days a week and 8,9 or 10 hours a day.  

Life for many men is work, eat, sleep and repeat, I know I live that life and see other men doing the same thing."

0,"I am not Scared of Making Friends.
I am Just scared of Losing Them."
1,"One day all you social animals will yield to evolution and we who can live happily with a single good friend and a house will take over. >:3
Of course I'm joking. But not everyone feels lonely while alone. n_n

Having said that, I'm glad I watched the video through anyway. It reminded me of the fact that there is such a thing as board game clubs that are there more for people who want to play games, than it is for people who want to spend time with their friends. So you'll mostly always find someone to play a game with.

The important thing in this video I'd like to emphasize, is that you go to places you enjoy going to. Worst thing that could happen to me at a board game club, is that I watch some people play an interesting game, which I do on youtube anyway. xD Best case scenario, a regular person I play with becomes a friend. c:"
2,"Bro, i freaking love spicy foood, and music, but i also like quet and calm nature, what am i? an extraverted intravert?"

1,Someone in the kurzgesagt team has the blue shirt guy dancing
1,"How am I supposed to start a board game group if nobody ever shows up? It all depends on the willingness of others to spend time with strangers, which is in short supply. I give friendships a priority in my life, reach out to people, show genuine interest in them, but it only ever lasts for one encounter. Nobody reciprocates enough or gives me the consideration I give them."
1,You know you hit your lowest when you actually watch this video till the end
1,"Friends aren't real. You can give all of your time and effort and energy and resources, when the cards are down. No one is going to be there to help you, you care much more for them than they ever will for you."
1,Kurzgesagt really likes Settlers of Catan. beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,"I am on the Autism spectrum, but even I get lonely sometimes."
1,"As an person with autism, maintaining friendships is so hard. I'm so greatful for the handful that take the initiative, because they know it's scary for me.
Being socially awkward does not mean that I hate socializing."
1,"I can't believe you posted this the day i was having a very painful moment, it's just frustrating to see that you've built a friendship for years, and only to see it tear down in seconds. Despite this being the hardest times in my life, and after feeling heartbroken like, way far than an average person would feel it, I'd like to admit this is WAY more painful than i thought it would be. I just wanted to thank you for uploading this the moment i was feeling like in a tragedy, I'll try and recover from this pain because I've never felt so much hollow in myself."
1,"To whoever is reading this: Everyone feel the same as you, everyone has their own issues, just talk to people, if they being nasty then tell them to fuck off and move on to find someone else

Then I could meet anybody knowing when to talk a bit more or not"
1,"Sadly, disability and discrimination makes it much harder"
1,"who would've known that friendship valued this much?

always hoped to have new friends but couldn't because i was intentionally making myself busy so that i won't feel lonely
moreover feeling lonely felt like it's essential for me, it gave me good grades, gave me scholarship and stuff

but the more i stayed lone the depression hit was real, i tried changing my life style for around 5 yrs now yet i still have less friends then i want
good luck guys, i decided to make a big step  hope the 5yrs of effort was worth it  hope you guys do too"

1,"Ugh, Kurzgesagt is reading my mind now huh"
2,what is a friend?
1,"My grandmother lived through the 1918 pandemic. It lasted 3 years, not a lifetime. She had friends. The pandemic didn't end her social life. 100 years later, we're a bunch of spoiled, entitled, maladjusted whiners. Life is one day at a time. Each day is a new beginning. Get off the phone, get out there, and walk around with a smile on your face. See what happens. It's not magic."
1,Having no friends and social life is really depressing pleading_face
1,"But I felt so different when the pandamic happened, I felt so save because I didn't have to face the loneliness in class that I didn't connect with anyone of them, also I hate being looked at by others girls in other class. I was so sensitive. And so on many bad things happened in my life too. Now I feel really scared to meet or join a new club or class. Maybe I scared of being hurt by someone else, or the injury in the past truely deep that made me feel uncomfortable and insecure. Anyone can give me some advices?"
1,This is what I needed in life right now. Thank you growing_heart
2,Book recommendation: How to make friends and influence people.
1,"well that made me cry a bit. I am feeling the pain of completely investing in a ""central node friend"" and then falling out with them. D&D has been a balm and an avenue for social contact most of my life, I highly suggest it."
1,"I was really excited to watch this as I feel very concerned by the title and I know the production quality of this channel. However, for once I feel kind of disappointed after watching a Kurzgesagt's video. 

The root causes of having difficulties to make friends were not addressed or at least it does not suit my case.
For me the problem does not come for a lack of time or commitment but rather from a lack of social skills. I can't just make friends by spending time with others when I can't even engage a conversation and sustain a small talk of a few minutes."
1,I moved jobs and this work from home stumped my social life :(
1, this study is not true in all cases. I'm literally the one who is just sit there in the class unable to speak or make friends with others or they just come and try to talk to me but no. They all ignored me like I don't even exist. This happened to me and will happen to me for the rest of my life.
1,"I have been alone now for 9 months, getting used to it. I'm just exhausted for trying to meet same minded people"
2,"This is such a good video at this time! 
I loved the meet-up idea! Is anyone up for a gathering in Dubai?"
1,"Actually my ""friends"" just have me psychologic problems and trauma, I feel much better and connected to reality while alone. And I can't get rid of them, they always want to come back to my life. So I think I will stick with being alone."
1,"i'm an introverted technophile athiest in kansas. i have many friends but most of them are work related, and few of them know i'm an athiest. my last close friend died a few years ago. i hope one day to actually manage to follow through on actually trying to find new close friends, but remember the first thing, i'm an introvert. in the moment i don't feel anything wrong about being alone, i'll just crack open a book."

The thing is, nobody want to exchange normal phone numbers anymore.

1," this is such an important thing to understand. 
Especially to teen that are 13/16 years old, in that period everyone starts going out with their friends and for some people it can be sad to see everyone at those ages have a lot of friends while you have none.

It's so hard to make friends in my school (and nowadays) since im in highschool and mostly everyone has friends. There could be a possibility that there are actually some people alone, but I'm not sure which table to go to or where to look since the tables in my cafeteria are always mostly crowded with tons of people, the atriums tables are filled with friend groups talk to each other, and Im not sure about the library which may be my only choice left. I don't want to keep disappointing myself by not being committed to my goals. It's not like its going to matter to other commenters as this will probably get no replies anyway."

1,I just got roast by title...
1,"sometimes i think that the agricultural and especially the industrial revolution was for the worst. sure our ""quality of life"" and life expectancy improved, but it doesn't seem like anyone has got any happier. think about it. we evolved for hunter gathering, so our reward system would be wired around it. pretty much if you and your tribe is able to survive, you are happy.

when hunter gatherers were asked what makes them happy they replied with ""Meat, and honey."" 

many things about our bodies that might be inconvenient in the modern world makes perfect sense for hunter gatherers.
for example, stress. if you are stressed out in the wilderness, it is your bodies signal to you that there is a big issue that needs to be solved, and that is why you are stressed out. for example there might be lions lurking around, or you haven't been able to find drinking water. If you solve these issues, the stress goes away. in the modern world stress is a product of the way we have structured our world. if you are stressed because you have to do a soul crushing commute everyday, or maybe you have school and there is an exam tomorrow, you cant just solve the problem there, you have to go to work and you have to do that test. and these stressful things are near daily.

A way that we can help with unhappiness in cities is to make them less car dependent (especially in america) if it is easy to walk and bike to get around, and also streets are open to social activites, then socializing becomes a lot easier. you will also be happier if you walk or bike to work because it is a form of physical activity. you can get a workout doing an ordinary task (like a commute, or getting groceries) without having to ever go out of your way to exercise."
1,"Damn Kurzgesagt, I'm literally crying after this vid.
I feel like I will never make a friend. This video is so positive and encouraging about this topic, while the reality is that friendship or normal social activity is impossible for me."
1,"after losing all friends in high school now i have 0 friends and i like staying at home alone watching things on internet, and i cant be bothered about socializing as i was very much introverted and anti social type of person even when i had those few friends. i dont feel like introducing myself to someone and getting to know someone new now, i feel too tired to put all those efforts again. in the past, when i gave my all in friendships, i received tears in return so now friendship feels like a waste of emotions to me. i attach myself to friends and now its hard to forget about a everything, i dont think i'll be able to attach myself to someone ever again. i have 1 online friends who lives in another country."

1,"The best thing I've ever done for my social life was leave the city and go work seasonal jobs in a national park. So many like-minded individuals doing the same thing.

1,I kinda knew in advance that this video wouldn't really end up helping me. Basically all my friendship groups revolved around school other than the one at home that centered around my best friend from elementary school. After I quit school the one friend group at home was all I had and they broke up due to some fighting that I know nothing about myself. I don't really have anywhere to go for hobbies and can't really go far away as I have to be close to help care for my family.
2,thank you
2,I think this helped me
2,Very insightful video. Thank you!
2,I hope komi-san watch this
1,"Great video, with one caveat: Don't undervalue the importance of online friendships. The, ""weirder"" you are (in a good way), the less likely there are to be similar people in your immediate proximity. And I'm not talking about shallow, ""we like each others' tweets"" friendships but rather the people you have real conversations with that are both lighthearted and profoundly deep. These conversations can happen over coffee, text, or voice chat, and it doesn't matter if you're in the same city, state, or country. I've felt incredibly lonely while physically surrounded by friends, and also incredibly fulfilled talking to people I have deep connections with online. It's definitely a benefit to be able to see your friends in real life, but online friends are just as much friends as people who live near you and removing the physical barrier increases your chances of meeting people who fit together magically with your wavelength. :)"
1,"I choose to be lonely, people just want to use you. Even if that isn't their intention."
1,"it's an interesting topic ... but at the same time very sad, this channel who mostly cater to adult that love hard science literally discussing kindergarten level topic, this shit should be talk about for toddler, yet in today society sadly...very very sadly adult probably need it more"
1,"It's important to remember that other people _must be willing to be befriended._ In a world as obsessed with optimizing everything as ours is, every personal relationship represents a risk of becoming entangled in someone else's problems. That causes a lot of people to be wary of being befriended by anyone who is actually _trying_ to make friends, because there's the pervasive fear that they're looking to make friends so they can have someone else to dump their problems onto. And that does indeed happen, just often enough to reinforce the fear that it could happen at any time. As long as that mindset exists, making friends will be much harder than merely ""learning how to socialize"" or ""being a good listener""."
1,It's enough to make a man cry
1,Sad they have to make another one of these...
2,i love this channel
1,The reason im lonely is because the few friends I've managed to obtain work 6 days a week for 8hrs so I don't see them but once/twice a year
1,Thanks for making this awesome vid!
1,"I'm not going to search for pity comments.
I won't contradict what was said in the video, because I believe it to be more reliable than my words.
But I had this problem for most of my life, which isn't long, 21, but of course it only created more problems.
The few friends I had in the past They betrayed me or simply abandoned me along the way.
This plus the fact that I already had enough problems at home only took me down a spiral of depression and isolation.
Which didn't get better, since, everytime I tried to go out of my bubble I only met insults and laughter.
It was no surprise that I spent all my time in high school and after that alone.
Right now to, which isn't, unfortunately, curable with therapy, as much as I want too.
That plus the bullying I had to endure since elementary school.
My isolation in the classroom just made easier my ostracization.
Just left me with a ghost of what I once was, I want to be optimistic, but I don't buy it.
Anw I appreciate it if you took time to read this...thing.
It's more than 99% attention that usually people give me.
Even tho, once again I highly doubt someone will read this."
1,They need to make a mandatory friendship class in college. I feel like once people are in college they either have the easiest time making friends or the hardest. Also at that point everyone starts realizing the importance and need for friendships.
1,I just started going to a new school and I am having problems socializing because people In my class mostly speak a different language. I can understand what they are saying but I dont speak that good. I dont know what to do about it
1,"this came on my recomendations....













i think im doing something wrong..."
1,"Never had good friends ever. Family members are busy most of the time. Being introvert sucks literally. I wish I could change, but idk what my therapist is up to... I'm like done...already given up trying making friends, many betray, many don't simply care and what not. 
I'm still learning how to stay lonely and not suffer mentally"

1,"Yeah, I worked a job in 2018 that was full remote, I left college with a few friends, and now I know none of them, and not due to a lack of engagement with them or planning events. Some of this advice is accurate, but I'll say this, I've tried my hardest. No matter how funny or eccentric you are, or how involved you get into someone else life, you're just a background NPC programmed to be polite and engaged to them. Since 2018, I've made zero friends. I've gone to local events, joined local discord channels, and nothing blossomed. I'm normal, hell I'm a little crazy and make some of the best jokes out of bad situations, but it's gotten me nowhere. Focus on yourselves homies."
1,"Ah dang Kurzegesagt, why you gotta make me cry like this."
1,"And for any parents out there, you can help! Try to help your kid participate in things they’re invited to.

When I was a kid I had a ton of friends, but as I got towards middle school and high school my friends grew up and my parents weren’t quite ready. I started getting invites to movies with violence or swearing in them or to just go hang out at the mall and it was too much for them so I had to turn the invites down. Love my parents and they were just trying to raise me right but after saying no to every invitation they just stopped coming."

I got into a motorcycle wreck 2 week ago (I wasn't hurt, but for some scratches) and my bike was pretty damaged. I was just coming back from a marvelous hiking trip, so I didn't suffer from it much. After getting my bike back and working a few days all the anxiety popped up."
1,Needed this today after a big move. Thanks guys
2,Youtube has just recommended me this...
1,"As someone who basically isolated themselves threw out most of their school life, it really is a struggle to start from scratch to meet the right people while juggling work, figuring out my next path in life, working on personal hobbies and so on. Even making minor efforts in making them connections can help you out from my own experiences, weather it's being acquainted with a cashier at your local store, having a fun chat with online strangers and other minor interactions. Even if they don't become friendships, they are still steps in raising your confidence, and small progress is better then none."
1,Bro meowbahh fans need to watch this
1,i went to a private school where you’re stuck in the same classroom with the same people for the past 7 years. i left the school and joined a cheer group. everyone already has their own friend groups and i’m just there. i have no idea what to doloudly_crying_face

1,It’s cool how he used people instead of birds in this video to make it relatable.
1,"In my mid 30s now and haven't had a friend for about 12 years. Pretty much forgotten what it feels like. Whenever I get close to someone I start to freak out and create distance from them, not sure why. Friendship isn't for me I suppose. Luckily I'm quite comfortable being by myself."

1,Thnk uu for this type of stuff . These are so relatable one
1,"I have the feeling, that people tend to not open up at all lately. A friendship is, just as said in the video, a connection between people, who can share, trust and enjoy each other. That implies the fact, that you are ready to give yourself in to that bond. But many people are not ready for that. I am not talking about shy, or introverted people, who need time to trust, but much more about everyone. The most interhuman connections feel more like a ""Buddyship"" than a ""Friendship"". So for example- If you need help late at night, most people won't answer, or say that they can't come over because whatsoever. So in conclusion most individuals are willing to *get* something out of this type of relationship rather than *give* something. Most certainly in countries that are well developed and people mostly live in great conditions, this seems to be the case more often. People are tied in their own minds and do not really try to reflect on themselves, what is a huge block for forming new friendships. Also in romantic relationships- How many people break up, because of the lack of communication within their relationship? Many. Maybe even most people. 
It is the trust and commitment that lacks nowadays. Thats why people feel lonely, depressed and wayyy to often misunderstood- because there are not enough people that are willing to take you under their wing without expecting anything apart from the normal friendship from you."

1,Eversince I moved to a new country (USA) I’ve been stuck I can’t make any friends because everything rather everyone is so different here maybe that’s just an excuse but it’s so much harder to form a friendship here. I’m in highschool and it feels like everyone has already formed their close bubbles that I can’t join and everyday I tell my self I can live without friends I just need the mental fortitude to keep going without that luxury. But without friends going to school everyday makes my life hell. I need help.

1,"Connecting with the joy of looking at beautiful things. This will make you fall in love with life. The beauty of when I walk out of my house, I look at trees, cars, the sun, the clouds, the desert, where I live. Even my own body.

Just that alone is enough to create an amazingly fulfilling life."

This is one tough generation coming up. They’ve had to endure things I could never have imagined back in my day."
1,"Speaking as a recent college graduate working from home, I have to say that I have had to become more extroverted to maintain connections with those in my area as well as those who moved away.

However, when a connection is reestablished or reinforced, it all feels like it's worth it. My best wishes for everyone out there! Keep trying!"

Thanks kurz"
2, the 2 other friends trying to be in the photo just got forgotten
1,"I recently started College and during this time I have met a dozen of people. I don’t consider myself as an extrovert person because I prefer passing my time alone than with people around me (even with my gf I am like that). Making casual friends you know from your classes is a common thing but none of them are truly my friends. I'm not someone who likes to talk a lot because deep inside me I simply can’t express so easily stuffs I want to say and when I genuinely open with someone, I feel like completely lack of interest and attention. I know my gf tries sometimes to make me open up myself but it is extremely difficult to have different extrovert and introvert personalities in a same relationship and normally I'm the one that hears and she speaks. Even though all of this said, I once know a friend (RIP) which in my opinion, was the perfect definition of a real friend. He somehow made me feel so deeply secure speaking with him and was genuinely easy to express what I feel with him, because I knew he will listen (for those wondering, he died from cancer almost 3 years ago). I missed so much but fortunately for me, I have come to know somehow who I can feel secure again and that’s my gf, just not in the same degree as I had with that friend. 

Making close relationships is hard, but normally those who can share similar stories and have live a similar life to you, are the ones who will understand better and will be more likely to become friends. My 2 best friends are people who have I love so deeply in my heart because the 13 years I have come to know them; they’re similar and different to me, so it makes it feel great to feel like I have someone I can count on, always."

1,"I don't need friends. They disappoint me.

1,Please do : how to get a girlfriend
1,Idk why but I cried a little at the end. I'm gonna share this.
1,"I have never had trouble making friends. I had lots of friends in school and high school. Every job i've worked at, I made friends there. I played lots of online games over the years and made loads of friends there.

The problem I have with friends is keeping them. When I graduated high school, I lost contact with all my friends there except one. Those friends at work? After I changed jobs, I never spoke to any of them again. The online friends, some of which I had played games with for more than a decade, and a few i'd played with for 15 years. But after I stopped gaming as much, we stopped talking.

That one friend from high school we actually made an agreement with each other to be best friends for life. We stayed in touch, spoke regularly for years. When each of us graduated college (living in different states) we attended the other's graduation and attended each other's parties afterward. But we began to talk less and less as both of us drifted more toward people who were physically closer to us. People we could hang out with on the regular, go do stuff together like goto the movies, etc. Our chats went from weekly, to monthly, to yearly, to once every couple of years. I then went through a period where we hadn't spoken together for 6 years.

Now, I was as much at fault as my friend was for letting this happen. We both kind of naturally drifted apart because we lived in different states. I think if we had lived in the same city, things would've been different. But after I made attempts to try to reconnect with him, he was always happy to talk to me and we'd talk for hours at a time catching up, but then he'd make no effort to initiate conversation with me, too busy with his own life.

The friends I played World of Warcraft with were the best friends I had in my life. The reason why is because we talked to each other every single day. We were also on voice chat laughing and bullshitting and just having a great time. We even met up for conventions and had parties in the real world. We knew so much about each other and we were all there for each other during hard times too, always providing a shoulder to cry on and an ear to listen. We were all so close. I even married one of my fellow raiders after we met at a convention and we started a relationship. We're still happily together to this day. But the friend group slowly broke up over time as people began to move on to other things and didn't play anymore. And eventually I also quit, and all those connections faded pretty rapidly.

So for me, making friends has never been an issue. I've been described by a lot of people are very charismatic and fun to be around, but KEEPING friends who want to be friends just for the sake of being friends seems impossible. Everyone is so busy, has so little free time, and when they DO have free time, they want to spend it with friends they can do more stuff with physically as well as spouses/significant others/kids.

I feel like there just isn't enough TIME for people to have friends these days or that friends are primarily for younger people who have more free time available. Once you have more responsibilities and obligations that eat up more and more of your time, and that generally increases as you get older, you just don't have time for friends anymore. The core of a friendship always seems to be proximity. I had friends at school because they were people I was around all the time. I had friends at work because they were people I was around all the time. I had friends online because they were people I was around all the time. Once you stop being around, it's like the friendship is immediately invalidated and fades away into nothingness.

It is kind of sad as i'd love to have a close knit friend group like I had years ago in WOW, but at the same time I just don't have the time to make that work for anything outside of special occasions.

TLDR is Making friends is easy. Keeping friends is hard. Having time for friends gets harder and harder as life goes on.

One final anecdote is something that happened to me about a month ago. I was at my favorite chinese buffet eating with my wife, and I hear the people in the booth directly behind me talking about Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition. I live D&D 5e and used to play it a few years ago. Tabletop games are INTENSELY rare in the place where I live as it is very rural. I had a really strong urge to turn around and chat them up about it, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized I just don't have time for any of that. No time for the games anymore, no time to hang out with friends, and without either of those two things what would be the point? So I decided not to say anything. I kind of regret it, but even now, I know it wouldn't have worked or became anything because there just isn't enough time.

Give me a world where I don't have to work all the time and i'd probably have a lot of friends, but as long as society keeps to the corporate driven slave policies of the modern era, there is barely time for anything outside of work and sleep. If you want to fight loneliness and depression, no longer treating human beings like slaves would go a long fucking way."
1,I find it hilarious that Kurzgesagt who are known for often delivering existential terror decided that calling out their viewers for being lonely was too harsh.

1,"I know that Kurzgesagt does not make these type of videos to become a therapy like channel, however, the amount of help I received through these videos is insane and I really appreciate the topics covered and the way they are tacked. I have no words to describe how helpful these videos are for me and how much I have learned throughout them. They are giving me the push I needed to improve and invest more in many aspects of my life I otherwise wouldn't have done so. 
 I am enormously grateful Kurzgesagt, truly grateful."
1,"My question is, where are the birds?"
1,"I prefer being a lone wolf. I go workout at the gym, I shoot my guns when I feel like it, I go to the race track on occasion, I read a new book every month and I go for a David Goggins style run every morning. I'm taking a solo road trip soon to Utah and Arizona. I've learned that friends will only want to take from me. My last ex was planning on marrying me and then divorcing me for my assets. I saw her texts and broke it off. As a trust fund baby, it's difficult to make genuine friends when they see your cars, lifestyle or your house. Sometimes I think ""What if I buy a regular car and a regular 200k houss"" but that would be like a regular Joe buying a $1,000 car with a trailer home. lol. It's just strange... Ah well, nothing wrong with living that Bachelor life. If I find the right woman, that's great but I'm happy being alone. I don't feel lonely being alone if that makes sense."
2,what makes it hard too is when you become depressed you kind of lose your personality. and it’s hard to make friends when you feel like you have no personality
1,I am in high school rn and i have like no friends at all if i make new friends after some time they just forgets me even i am trying to be with him all the time and this happens almost all the time like i am completely normal in everything and i dont has this problem in elementary school but in high school i am facing this problem and i am getting slowly depressed and i am not in any relationship rn plus i really need friends cuz i dont want to be drepressed like i find the perfect match for me but still this happens like i am done man
1,"kurzgesagt, personally my problem of making friends is not this. the main problem is about snake people who take advantage of us, stealing other friends, secretively drag us down by being polite in professional life and backstab everytime. the faith from friendship is lost. that's why people tend to be alone and even suffering from loneliness is their own choice bc they want to save themselves from this shitty competition stress and further betrayal. 
this video is mostly about introverted people.
edit: I'm willingly a lonely person and I also hate this feeling of loneliness bt I hv no choice for being alone bc of this reason I hv mentioned."
1,"I didn't search for this video and I was finally confessing to my mother, 2 days ago, how utterly lonely I am. It was a call for help, cause my support network doesn't seem to understand how unwell and unfit I always come back to feeling after the last 4 years. I don't know if this can be cured. I'm scared."

1,"Lets be honest the word ""friends"" has a whole different meaning than before. These days ppl don't want to hear what going on in your life or your interests etc, they just want to talk about themselves teh only common interest u have with them or a desire from you. Once you realise you guys literally don't talk about anything other than let's say football you loose interest. Now today's society is how I should looking public to impress that one cool popular rich person instead of focusing on Ur life or being yourself
And I'm not gonna say at least pretend to care, BC I know a lot of instances that that hasn't worked. Actually learn to care instead of pretending. If u have a good laugh with someone once or twice doesn't mean your friends wait till u know that person before u call them Ur friend"

I can't relate to anyone and I have to fake myself all the time, otherwise I wouldn't even at least have someone to talk to about something.

1,"This is bang on and probably one of my favorite videos you have created.  I would add 2 things to this though.  

1) Eating together is a Powerful indicator of quality of the relationship you have.  You need to eat regularly with your family, and semi frequently with your friends.  And its OK if you rarely eat with acquaintances.  But who and how often you eat with others is the best indicator of the level your at with them.

2)  Get off the phones!  Relationships are face to face connections.  We need to see and feel together to be.  You can't get them online.  And when you go online around people you know, your not with them.  Our phones are easily the single largest divider of friendships ever created.  We were all better off before the internet was in our pockets.  

So please, when your eating with others, leave your phones in your coat pocket at the door and forget about it for the duration of your shared experiences.  :)"
1,the more people you know....the more chances that they will hurt you
1,Recognize the difference between social relationships and parasocial relationships.
1,I love how even the most normie of the normies now recognizes that lockdowns were bad for society. Enjoy your heart failure though.
1,"man i remember like 2 days ago, i was playing with a few friends in VR (we literally all found out we had VR headsets like 3 days ago, we all had one, just didn't know the others had one until someone asked) and we played Rec Room, it felt like unreal having the entire group back together, but also not, and when i put off the headset like 2 hours later i felt sad and happy at the same time. knowing the fun is over but also that everyone else of my friends are happy
never have i been this close to my friends in years"
2,Glad I'm ok with my best friend and wife. I can't imagine dealing with all the struggles of friend making.
1,Next : how to get some b*tches
2,Great way to tell your fans to go touch grass.
1,"Feelsbad when you're one of the highly connected social nodes. You're the person with the skills to make lots of friends and fight this issue but often you already have many friends to attend to, so you don't have the time to go making a bunch of other friends"
1,"I've never really had friends 
I am nearly 14"
1,"I am so tired and burnt out trying hard to always initiate gatherings for people I know to come together for the past few years. Apart from the convenient ‘reason’ of the pandemic, time has always been the main issue which I believe could be the best excuse as well. Even when the restriction due to the pandemic has been lifted, there will always be other excuses. Perhaps most are probably not interested at all since they do not even want to at least respond in any way."
1,I wish people called messaged me my phone is more dry then the Sahara desert
2,Totally not me getting a recommendation on how to make friends

1,"Most of my life i've been a sort of background character in someone's life, like everyone had a great time when i'm with them but over time they just kind of forgot about me, so now as a young adult, i avoid making friends so i don't get attached to them or form any kind of relationship because i know in the end, they'll forget about me, i know that isn't quite healthy but maybe someday, ill be ready again."

1,"This was really well made. As a Catholic, I have a hard time fitting in because my values are often very different. Perhaps I’m not in the right environment, but I’m not sure."
1,"Then there are people like me. While I like people, I don't waste time maintaining long-term friendships. I find it very easy to meet new people, but undesirable to allow anyone too close to me or to know too many details of my life. Acquaintanceship is good enough, and I'm perfectly happy even when totally alone. I feel sorry for people who need external connections to distract them from themselves. Covid gave me lots of free time to do things (and much less money to do them), but ""loneliness"" is a null word to me."
1,Haven't watched yet and it still hits hard.....
1,I feel really conflicted right now I was having such a shit day with the people I work with and decided that I didn't need anyone and I'm sick of trying to fit in but now I'm just confused
1,why does this video feel like a sociopath's manual?
2,"""and there are plenty of people who will be happy to have YOU in their life as a good friend"" made me cry thank you"
2,I guess the good news is that people like me will be shortened and put us out of our miseries lol.

2,You guys are great and should really be more well known across educators I feel like to help make actually good videos for education or social skills.
2,"Reminder friends are good and all, but you still need to be fine hanging with yourself from time to time because we are our best friends at the end"
1,why does this feel targeted loudly_crying_face
1,"I had a very rough week, constantly feeling lonely, while I was in group. ""If I disappear, nobody would notice.""
I know it's not true, but that's how I feel right now. People change and move, and I'm no exception. So why can't Injust accept this dreadful truth that we are all alone, and that we try to connect to forget this sad reality, even if it's for a moment ?"
1,"As an extreme introvert, I cannot relate to this video... the pandemic lockdown barely registered to me in loss of ""social contact""... in fact I reveled in it while working remotely from home"
1,"I haven't watched the video but just came here to say that maybe all you need is a change in environment/life to make new friends. 
In school I didn't have the closest of friends and felt lonely at times. I've recently moved away to another country for university and I have to say that I've made some incredibly good friends and I'm having a great time. A much needed change from my previous life in school. 
To make new friends, It does require the willingness to meet new people, and sure there will be people you may not like or wouldn't vibe as much with, but you won't know until you keep meeting and talking to new people. All it takes is a name exchange and a bit of small talk to get some initial impressions.
So if you're currently feeling lonely , try and meet some new people by joining some new club or some event. All it takes is a few words or just a simple hi. 
I mean I literally just made a great best friend by coincidence only by meeting him because I sent a message to a new GC I was added asking if anybody wanted to come along to a free BBQ that was happening. 

And if you've already tried that, you might have to wait for a change in life to occur that will allow you to go to a new environment/place. Good luck raised_fist."
1,where are ducks
1,And nevermind the atomisation caused by our Capitalist society. Capitalists deliberate separate people and propagate loneliness so that they can be sold products to fill the void left by having no friends.
1,"People need to stop saying this was caused by the pandemic when it was caused by governments and media treating healthy young people like they were in danger and dangerous to others, with no concern for the negative consequences."
1,"Just wanted to take this oppertunity and say that I am 100% open to new frienships. If you feel the same, let's strike up a conversation!"
1,"Why do you keep rehashing the exact same video topics? Like a couple videos on loneliness or climate change is great, they're important issues. But there have been honestly so many more than that. There is a lot of topics you've brought up in your videos in passing where you say ""but that requires its own video on another day"". Those are cool topics. Please make videos on those."
1,"Getting this in recommended videos: 

I feel personally attacked"
1,It's difficult to make friends because when you're going to talk to a stranger and propose friendship there's a big chance they're going to be rude or disrespectfull
1,"I am pushing 50 and I've gone from being a social butterfly to being lonely. I'm ok with it though as, looking back objectively, the people I thought were my friends were just using me. All things considered, I'd prefer to be by myself that with those who only pretend to care about me or consider me a second class friend. It's also very hard to meet people at this time in life. If it happens, great! But I'm not going to work hard at it like did for years, it's not worth it."
1,"This video posted at the right time when I need it (ಥ⁠╭⁠╮⁠ಥ)

This week after getting to new place immediately was a trouble for me to join groups or start something to connect with them

Or with old friends we got less and less time to play and talking 

As the too emotional person and rather staying at home and other, it's a struggle"
1,Kurzgesagt is starting to hit too near home with these
1,"It's harder depending on where you live. In a work-oriented culture like the USA or Japan, work has a way of just soaking up all your time. Not so for places like Europe and Latin America, which understand the value of the work/life balance."
1,This couldn't have come at a better time
1,I'm in this video and I don't like it
2,"Thank you for this video, it gives me hopes of improving my social life"
1,Is that settlers of catan????
1,"Damn the title really speaks to me at this moment, good timing."
1,"It seems that most friendships these days are artificial. The people involved in friendships or even romantic relationships view them as a mean to an end and care more about what you bring on the table for them rather than genuine appreciation for the other. If you aren't ""useful"" to them, then there is rejection. One can be rejected by a clique of a ""higher class"" not because they don't share the same passions but because they aren't well connected/ aren't rich."
2,I only have 2 friends.
1,Step 1: don‘t watch this video and go outside
1,"I literally had an emotional meltdown yesterday In my brother’s arms about how I’m so lonely and starving of affection that I want to die. He gave me advice for getting out more, simple steps like just intentionally sharing space with other people, shrink my personal bubble. At school, just share a study table with women, even if we don’t talk just share space, create the opportunity. Ask more questions to get people talking about themselves. 2020 absolutely fucked me up. Before COVID hit I watched my grandfather, my last father figure, die. Just like my father. Then COVID hit, and the family I lived with moved out of state to take care of grandma. I stayed behind because fuck Arizona, and my fam was stifling my growth. I had just watched my last father figure die, I hadn’t even begun to unpack that, then my family leaves and I’m alone living with roommates I don’t know or really gel with, and now I have to self-isolate REALLY intensely because one of the roomies was immunocompromised. I’m still not recovered from everything that’s happened in just that time, let along a childhood of neglect and social anxiety. It’s a miracle I’m alive, honestly."
2,It might help if we learn to enjoy our company.

1,Hmm some people are different though some people are happier alone because they can't identify with other humans
1,Tysm for the videos I'm still trying mybest making some lifelong friendships irl idk why it's so felt super hard to making friendships irl compared to social media disappointed_face
1,I am so happy I will be able to hear educational advice about this topic. I have very selected friends and opening a new chapter of my life where I don't have any friends in my new section. I talk to some of them but I am picking who and what type of person I will hold for me to grow with them. Thank you for this video!
1,"Im 35 and thinking about seriously going back to school. I only have my associate of arts from my early 20's and remember how fun and easy it was making friends at that time and circumstance. However, sometimes I get worried that even I went back, Id be considered 'too old' to try to mix in and socialize with the younger population thats around me, that people will just find it weird, or creepy, or whatever. What happens when you want to engage with other students when returning to Uni but are completely out of their age group?"
2,Thank you for this.
2,Too shy to make friends
1,These are the kinds of videos that really have a positive impact on society
0,the problem is i do have friends but my parents dont accept them
0,this is catastrophically stupid (<--- why i have no friends?)
1,Ahaha 2 days and already million views
1,I’m an extroverted person at school and am friends with most people in my year I also like to make sure that students who aren’t sat near anyone that I include them and sometimes I feel bad because I am like a central person that people are friends because of me and if I loose my energy then theese friendships can weaken
2,After enough time you stop wanting any kind of human connection
2,It is annoying when your two best friends ignore you and continue chatting. It happened to me a lotdisappointed_face
1,The Devil takes away my friends. They will always turn on me or leave me or turn into some negative magnet. Kinda sucks.
2,You shouldn’t call me out like that lol
1, minutes and I already want to cry Kurzgesagt
1,"In studies that track people over time, it was found that across cultures and across introverts and extroverts, people only really need 4-6 people ""with whom it would be difficult to imagine your life without."""
1,"Until I was 18 I grew up almost completely alone. I lived in such a remote area that I never had chances to really interact with much of anybody. I got out of my home state as soon as I could. I've always felt so alienated and distant from people. I'm 23 now and of course I've had opportunities to actually get out into the world somewhat and have relationships with people. However, it is excruciatingly difficult. When I interact with people I have so much trouble opening up. It makes me squeamish and sick trying to form connections with people and I hate it so I always tend to be a stone wall. Doesn't mean I'm not kind, but there is a certain point when I feel someone is trying to get to know me I go into survival mode and close myself up. Like I read from another comment below that perfectly put into words what I was thinking. I feel like a robot that is trying to learn how to be a human. After so many years of childhood not really being around or speaking to anybody I feel like I've been cheated out of living a normal life where I can have healthy relationships with people. It's exhausting."
1,"Way to rub it in, YouTube notifications…"
1,Most women know they hold all the power in a relationship... they can end it for little to no reason and they know they can have another guy before the sun sets if she wants one.  A guy... good luck!
1,What if we had a video of the consequences of a nuclear reactor fully exploding?
0,Make this video again but for why you get no bitches
1,"The BIGGEST problem about making friends in the USA, is that we have no dedicated town centers to live and thrive anymore. EVERYWHERE you go needs a CAR to get there. And once you get there all there ever is to do is EAT or SHOP. Thousands of miles across this country are dedicated to cars, eating, and shopping, and little else more. There’s nothing to do, nothing fun going on anywhere. People used to make friends just by bumping into strangers on the street. Those days are LONG GONE here when there aren’t even streets to walk on"

Lost a friend because he thought I purposely infected him with covid almost a year ago (He's very scared of covid, we're both in our late 20s). Nothing happened to any of us, just some cough.
He started being cold with me until he just stopped responding, RIP friendship, was good while it lasted, about a decade."
1,I`m a college student and recently I was feeling lonely and thus a tad bit depressed but by going out of my room to meet my fellows and other people I was able to overcome that sense of friendlessness. I found this video quite informative and accurate about the nature of friendship as a relationship. Thank you!
1,This video only focusses on the extrovert's ideal on 'proper living' and doesn't account for other personal types of happiness.
2,thanks!

1,"Hi there Kurzgesagt! I’ve always wanted to ask you this but figured you’d never read it. But I was just wondering if you could make a video about Autism or ADHD? I’ve grown up my whole life with it and struggled to make friends because of it, but it would make me feel happy if you could do a video about it sometime!

1,"Thank you so much for making this. It needs to be heard and talked about everywhere, and having a channel with a wide influence is a great place to spread something like this. I deeply appreciate what you've done. Thank you."
1,You know how to really make friends. Smile and say hello to a person who is also smiling. If they ain’t smiling leave them alone for now or find someone else. It’s a small world we live in.
1,"Hm, about the early human thing, there would also have to be that one outlier, a early human that would have to be alone for himself going weeks and months or his entire life without staying with a group but he survives just fine by himself, the whole humans are social creatures thing might not be entirely true, some people do enjoy being alone and don't necessarily get depressed from being alone"
1,I'm literally about to move around the world and was thinking about how I would make friends.
1,"> being alone in a class without saying a word makes others sympathetic to you
And that's when I realized I came from a parallel universe."
1,"After 3 min of watching this video, I *strongly disagree* with everything said here.

School for me was horrible and dreadful. It was 15 years of prison as far as I'm concerned. Though I had a friend, I'd repeatedly get backstabbed by said friend because he was a turncoat. In the end, he chose to sprout racist shit on Facebook as opposed to just rekindling friendship over 10 years ago ( _Around age 25_ ). Every rl friend I've had has ended up stabbing me in the back or I've outgrown them. I can't connect with people on a whole because my interest is usually more different than others ( _I like sci-fi, everyone likes fantasy, to take an example, and while I can move across all boundaries, everyone else are static_ ), and I am extremely introvert as a result of all my lifelong experiences.


This video just isn't relevant to me."
1,"I'm in high school but do school from home (online), Its basically impossible to have the ""casual interaction"" talked about in this video, I see people on occasion if I go somewhere but there's never really a natural time to start talking to someone, people are usually doing something or talking to each other and I have no prior knowledge about any of them."

1,I feel like I have to many friends. I don’t really have time for much else. But i still have enough time. So it’s fine but I think this might be a problem soon.
1,bro the matching posters r cuteeee
1,"I think what most people need to learn is not necessarily how to ""make"" friends, but how to ""maintain"" friendships and how to decide which ones are worth the maintenance. I'm an extrovert, ENFP specifically, but I only have like 4 close friends at a time max. My circle of ""close friends"" tends to change with enough time too, which I think is fine as long as it doesn't sour.

You'll know you've got something good when you haven't been ""close friends"" for a long time, but you see each other and reconnect pretty easily. To me, that's the true test."

2,For me i think having no friends is kinda good
1,this is the video i needed
2,but what if no one accept me even i've been trying my best to being nice and talk to them? everytime i speak they seems like not interested at all and just ignoring me. any advice? :<<
1,"This was more than a coincidence. New school, no friends yet."
1,"I just started college a few weeks ago and have been feeling this hard. None of my friends from High School go to my college, although I have kept in touch with them over discord, I'd also like to make new friends in college. It just seems extremely hard to make friends because nothing is concrete in college. You may have different classes, different times that you are just chilling, different sleep schedules, different meal times, or even decide to sit in different seats in your classes. All of these seem to make making friends a hard time for me because I want to get to know someone, but I never know how to start making friends."
1, what is that Axelotle tank BRUH
1,"Why did I see the original title as ""why your a loser and have no friends?"""
2,"I don’t have the drive to make friends any more, so many friends died and I just don’t want to know new people."
1,"The part where you mentioned you could've lost a lifetime friend just by not making a small talk around them hits me. This is really, genuinely a great video to help yourself and also bring new perspectives into making and maintaining friendships. It's like I understood it, but I wish I could just flip a switch in my head and make new friends and reach out to old ones without worries. Mixing it up with low self-esteem and social anxiety it becomes the most impossible task for me and it makes me feel worse that a simple thing that can be done by everybody gets overcomplicated in my head that it ends up being a fear of mine. I doubt myself all the time if there's something seriously wrong with me and if I myself is the problem. I wish I can go to a therapist because this is a bigger issue in my life than I want to admit."

1,"Just a few days ago, I severed all connections with my ""best friend"" who had become abusive, and I was extremely worried that I would lose touch with people as a result. This video literally could not have come at a better time."
1,"Loneliness is just an emotion, a few chemicals in the brain. An Antidepressant will effectively neutralize the emotion causing chemicals in your brain. You never have to feel lonely again. Antidepressants are far cheaper than the costs of relationships,  also eliminates the time and stresses."

1,Thank you kurzgesagt for making this video
1,"idk why but I think I feel the most lonely during January and September. January being first month of the year is pretty overwhelming and I feel the most lonely. And September is when school starts and it makes me feel lonely bc I got no friends to hangout with during the school hours. But for some reason during the rest of the other months I'm fine being alone and all introvered without feeling that lonely. 
pretty strange right? o.o"

1,A lot of people are weird expecially nowadays
2,"good. Now let me keep my life the same way and not get any friends, and then whine about it and search videos like this."
1,"I literally fell back in to depression because lately, I feel like I always planning and inviting friends to things but hardly see the effort reciprocated back. I moved cross country right before the pandemic and it's been difficult making new friends. Recently I was able to grow my circle but haven't yet found the ones where I feel like could be my best friend. Thanks for making this video and helping me understand the struggles and what I can do to enrich the budding friendships I have"

1,Enough
2,You have to degrade yourself and lower your standards be a 3rd option if you want friends now a days. I'm good
1,Touched by the video and the initiative :)
1,"I love you and everyone here, this video made me cry with clarity"
1,"that part at the beginning about making time for friends/relationships being simple but not as easy as it sounds kind of rings true for the entirety of the video lmao.  this is just “how to make friends” as written by clinical psychologists, and not by people who’ve made lasting friendships and relationships from nothing."
1,A lot of people needed this right now
1,This video was released at a pefect time.
1,"I moved abroad to be a teacher. I act as their teacher for their whole time at school, even as they move up the grades, and for years, my kids have been the only people in the world who love me and they are my everything. my work contract finished and now I can never see them again because I can't just go stalk kids. I wasn't even given a chance to tell them goodbye. I am trying to make friends but these people I meet at events and then maybe see again only a couple times in a year do nothing to help my loneliness."
1,Kuezgesagt's recent foray into social topics has been a delight.
1,Is God trying to tell me something
1,"Coming up on 14 now, the thing that is difficult for me is that I focus a lot of my time on academics/school. I find that I can't get time to get together with a colleague/classmate because I embed myself in work even after school ends as I work extra-curricular because I want to excel and get top-grades so that further limits the time I have to socialise. The question you ask is 'Why don't you socialise with your classmates/colleagues?' and the thing is I try talk to people and people know me as an outgoing, loud person, and that's only because I speak loud, but the reason why I found it hard was that I never find people with my quirky interests. I want to find people and have long, sustainable relationships but my family kind of limits that, and I'm afraid I'll become depressed as a
workaholic."
1,"I think this is my favourite video they've made, I think because of how relatable the content is as opposed to learning about how we will all die and how small we are compared to the rest of the universe."
2,"Pretty sure depression and social anxiety make it harder for me to maintain a friend. I love chatting and vibing with people, but maintaining a friendship drives my anxiety through the roof. I do it because it is worth it."

1,"Basically, be normal




Yup, this is not for me"

1,This easy to predict aspect of weakening and disenfranchising the masses was an integral part of the plandemic
1, at that moment i know why i don't have friend
1,"Kinda funny that this came out right when College is just starting for me, I've always been more of a hermit type and I do have friends outside of College yet I realized last school year after prom that love can be a more powerful drug than anything else in the world. You don't realize friends are there for more reasons than just being out with the boys, they're there for emotional support and making sure you have that bond that ensures some form of knowing everything is gonna be okay at the end of the day. 

Having friends to relate or be near at least to some degree only proves to be a good idea at the end of the day, and you should probably make yourself more comfortable with this realization as the pandemic ends. Get out there and form them bonds, nobody's going to do it for you"

0,Kurzgesagt is personally attacking me.
1,"YouTube asking me is this video helpful: Yes, yes it is"
1,"This is genuinely useful for people who are actually suffering from chronic loneliness and I won't knock it foot that, but I couldn't finish the video. To me it just feels like it is just typically saying ""Introverted? Here's how to be more social and outgoing.""

Sorry, I don't need to waste energy on making and maintaining friend groups, socializing is a genuinely tiring and exhausting activity. All the social activity I need is the bare minimum that my monkey brain needs to make me not go insane, and work provides that just fine."
1,"Believe it or not, about 20 percent of people don't care about having friends. Some people truly don't mind being alone and might enjoy it more."
1,I moved away from my home country for college just as the pandemic hit. It's been an absolute nightmare to tear myself away from all of my loved ones back home and drop myself in a place where I know literally nobody
1,"uuhhm how to organize things regularly if you have no place??? Edit: Got myself a few suggestion: Cinema, Clubs, Sitting in park."
1,"There are far worse things than  being without an intimate companion..

This is coming from a man who was extremely codependent.
In fact i was so codependent that i believed almost everyone was codependent, and just pretended they weren't.
But i experienced the universe showing me worse things than being without a partner. Like being  strapped down to a bed and being held against my will. I was sent to the future on the other side of this simulation matrix.. and shown this, because people in the future are being held against their will near the year 2500, because people dont know who is real human or bio ai there. The Future is hell. We must love ourselves and others unconditionally.  Thats why we are here.
We are chipped in tubs near the year 2500."

1,"And if you cannot adjust your time before becoming an adult, you will never have the time to make any new friends or meet any new people other than online with isn't very healthy for other reasons including the fact that real people are hard to find amongst the many bots and alt accounts.

Add that to the very real fearns many people have with interacting with strangers and you won't even want to waste any of your precious spare time on trying to converse with people that may just sap your energy or do nothing but instigate and belittle you.

We are in late stage capitalism, there is no time for friend's, no time for get togethers, when we need to work 3-4 jobs just to survive in areas intentionally designed to starve and controll people.

1,"I’m glad people are finding this video helpful. The advice is useful. However, the title is dishonest. You ask ’Why are you lonely?’ and then do you do not address the systemic reasons for our societies' loneliness epidemic

While it is true that there are things individuals can and should do to increase their connectedness, the impression this video gives is that people are lonely because they are not good at doing x, y or z. There is a blame inherent here which doesn’t feel helpful to me. There are deep underlying systemic reasons why more people than ever before in recorded history feel lonely and disconnected. Reasons connected to the death of the small close-knit social structures our ancestors lived in; 100-150 people and everyone knew each other. Our ancestors would have had a level of mutual understanding and respect even with those members of the tribe that they didn’t like. Compare this with Twitter wars… I'm not saying lets go back to being tribes but its helpful to understand that we are deeply hardwired to live that way,

Another reason for our systemic loneliness epidemic relates to our estrangement from the natural environment. It is not possible to feel truly connected (I’m talking in the more-than human sense, which is very interlinked) when one does not even know what ground the food one easts was grown on. Without the land and the water we are nothing. And yet we have forgotten this and take both for granted. One great resource on this is Barry Lopez. He interviewed hundreds of indigenous leaders around the World. He asked them for their view on our Western, industrialised, ‘civilised’ society, and one word kept coming up again and again; No, not greed; the word was ‘Lonely’.

While the truth is harder to stomach, I cannot stress enough that loneliness is a SYSTEMIC problem relating to the social and physical structures we as a species have built for ourselves. I don’t claim to know the answers but being aware of this is (in my view) vital so that we don’t start blaming ourselves or feeling bad that we find connection difficult. Loneliness is a public health crisis. So reach out, show up for your friends. And Don’t berate yourself when you do feel lonely. We’re in this together!"
1,"That upward spiral is at true miracle though, it takes effort to get it started but boy can a good entourage get you out of some hell-ish depths"
1,"The reason I am not able to make any friends is before I start getting closer to them I noticed there true nature and thats not for one time it's happened many times, so I don't know what is the meaning of having true friends?"

And I have a hard time setting boundaries, yesterday this friend from work, who I share plenty of interests with, talked to me on the phone for over an hour, and while I enjoyed it, I had other things I needed to do, and the conversation dragged for so long I just wanted to hang up, which caused me to get irritated, because I don't know how to say no, or excuse myself, or politely leave... So I just forego the entire thing."

Now I have a different approach, I will do my best but I won’t go out of my way to make shit happen, unless I see the same level of effort and interest from the other person"

2,Wow This js sad 5.2 M watched this
1,They went from science to giving people life advice
1,"Seems like most of us in the comment section struggle with finding friends. For me, it's because I left college and my work is 100% remote, so I'm lonely without wanting to be. We could start like a group discord or something. It's not much, but it's a start - since we all struggle with this so no one should feel left out or like they're a bad friend!"
1,"If you don't already have social connections, meeting new people is basically impossible nowadays lol. Ah well, such is life."
1,I think I'm weird because I don't need any connections to live. I could easily live my whole life alone.
1,"As a first year in university, I’ve been having this worry months before going. I’ve been introverted since almost forever (I might’ve been more extroverted with strangers before I moved to a new city) moreover, many of the friends I’ve made over the years in middle or high school were either them coming up to me and speaking, or we mutually met through other friends and kinda vibes, basically I never made the first move in making friends and was extremely lucky that people were just friendly with me.
However in university I don’t got connections to other friends, and I’ve gotta actually go talk to people, I’m sure people see a problem with this, for 18 years I’ve never made the first move due to fear of being rejected, however now in university I gotta go up to others and not just introduce myself with basic stuff formation and asking for their basic information but to actually get an connection I’ve gotta learn how to carry a conversation. So before even watching this video, I know I’m gonna feel something.

So now that it’s been 3 weeks, I’ve gotten more anxious about making friends in my classes, I’ve made some acquaintances in some of my classes but haven’t got someone I can just find and always sit next to in my lecture halls of 200-400 people. My last hope is joining clubs and making friends, but I do want friends in similar classes so I can talk about things relevant to those classes. 

Next week I’m planning on sitting next to people and talking but I’ve done some cringy stuff like watching videos of people interacting with others and seeing how they carry conversations. Like those jubilee videos, I find this kinda cringe but some what necessary for someone who can’t carry a conversation. Also I think another standard people can use to see how difficult it is for me to talk with other is by the fact that it usually takes me 2-3 minutes to even gain the courage to start speaking with others, if I don’t I hope they start since I can actually talk a lot, I’m just worried I over talk, or I don’t engage enough and ask enough about others. 

I’m hoping to me 2-3 friends in each class since i know the first year of university is usually when others are the most open to meeting others before they get really busy with their degree or education.

Now that I’m  minutes into the video, I’d also like to bring up the point of spending causal time with others to slowly bond together, when I moved in the 3rd grade, I literally didn’t have any friends except one person in the last month before summer break. The next friends I made were in the 4th grade after several months, I mean like 2-3 months before school ended. I spent months just casually speaking with them and eventually became good friends with them. 

Like in university I rarely find myself being able to have causal talks with others considering everyone is so busy with classes. Also with 400 ish students it’s just hard to find others, I should probably join a couple clubs once I get caught up in all my classes

Man living like 40 minutes away from the campus definitely doesn’t help, many of those who are in dorms and have the same classes have kinda made their groups of friends already, so inserting yourself in those groups is very hard. So my only chances are those who also have the same classes and live off campus. I’ve met like three that way, but only one of them I’ve gotten their instagrams and have talked to"
2,"I don’t have problems with friends, in fact, I am friends with people that have a lot of friends, kind of like a hub if hubs. One of the compliments given to me by a person who reviewed me for 2 years was that I am very good at making friends, too good that in fact as some of my friends sometimes fight each other for my attention, so maybe having too much friends is bad?"
1,"As always a very good video. I was going to tell my story as a friendless 40 year old from Sweden but realized how bleak it was after writing it down. So. I hope many people find this video and it will help them, it's to late for me. Take care!"
1,I have too many friends so I'm thinking of getting rid of him.
1,"If the people are not around you, is the cost really worth it? It can take several hours to set up a successful social event, which itself might last only half an hour. Several hours of lonely effort. The balance often ends up being negative."
2,Thanks Kurzgesagt I have made 100 friends since starting this video.
2,"thanks for calling me out like that, youtube suggestions."
1,"all my friends are with me only on online, if i ask them out they say they dont care. And on online they mostly just care about themselfs :("

1,Everybody getting called out flushed_face
1,"Why would I need friends though? Also, what are ""friends"" exactly? Could you make a video? If you guys would not like to, its fine!"
1,"About a half a year ago, I watched this video on my first day of college. It was my last semester of community college, and I really wanted to make a friend. 

This video came out a perfect time. I followed the advice, sat down next to a girl one of my classes, introduced myself... And we became really close friends.

I wish that was the end of this story.

She texted me a goodbye message tonight, telling me that she loved me and that she hopes I have a great future. 

She's had a history of suicide attempts.

I got nervous, tried to talk to her, but she wouldn't pick up. An hour passed, and with still no response, I contacted the police in hopes they could give her a wellness checkup. 

But apparently, someone already beat me to it.

And apparently, her mother knows of what happened.

I still don't know if she's alive or not. I hope she is, we didn't know each other long, but there were so many things I wanted to do with her. 

All I can do is lay in my bed and hope she's okay.

Because it doesn't matter how hard you try, you can never save someone from themselves."
1,"I will say this once : Kurzgesagt and its community have the potential to improve the life of much people, it truly is amazing. They must be doing this to compensate the existential dread they're giving us 80% of the time face_with_tears_of_joy"
1,"Funny to think that by the time I'm commenting this, not a single person has finished the video yet lol"
0,I am not lonely and have many friends. Wtf are you on.
1,"Urban planning plays a large role as well for why so many people are lonely. Dense neighbourhoods where you can easily meet in the middle for a coffee or walk in the park are better than sprawling neighborhoods where you have to drive for 15 minutes to see the other person. Dense neighbourhoods with spontaneous interactions help people become more social. Dense neighbourhoods where kids don't need to rely on their parents driving then but could instead walk, bike, or use transit to go see their friends fosters social connections. Our low density suburbs have hurt our desire to connect with the people in our neighborhood and the long commutes alone in the car take up the free time we could instead spend with our family and friends."
1,In elementary and middle school I had a lot of friends but when I got to high school at the peak of the pandemic I suddenly don’t fit in with anyone anymore
1,tell me something i don't know...
1,"I prefer being alone, I have 3 friends which i see only 2 of them once or twice a week, the other is once or twice a year.
I do talk to people and am happy to give people personal information about myself but that's it.....I don't really care what they think about me.
What does irritate me is the assumptions and straight up false understanding of why I'm introverted....that occasionally gets brought up by someone who does catch a conversation with me.
That then feels like I'm a forced character in their roleplay of some kind of drama show."
1,"Welp...instead of the usual existential crisis, Kurzegesagt served up a delicious serving of mid-life crisis. Thanks, Kurzegesagt!"
1,"My school closed down a little while ago, and I went to a different school than all my good friends and I developed a mild depression and loneliness. This video really helped. Thanks Kurzgesagt."

1,I’m 22 and I had the same group of friends since I was 10 so I kinda forgot how to make new ones. Sometimes it feels like making new friends is too much work to bother. grinning_face_with_sweat
1,"I basically lost my friends in third grade since i got put into another school on the other side of town. We hung out all the time before that. We had kind of a gang with me and the 3 friends. We had no communication methods. Then my old friend group fell apart while i was in a different school. None of us hang out anymore and I don't know what they are doing. It's quite bad since i have not had any friends since. There's some people i talk to occasionally, but i never hang out with anyone. It's really fecking annoying really."

1,Why is Kurzgesagt outing me like that neutral_face
1,"Yesterday video: “what happens when a block hole crashes with a star in the center of a galaxy”
Today video:”why u are lonely”"
1,"Its nonsense. Socializing is evidently nonsense. All the conflict is the result of meeting other s**ts. (prisoners are in social  environment, hence all the bad stuff in there). Terrorists encouraged by those other s**ts from their species. F all that. An also the chance of reproduction, pregnancy that utter disgusting s**t  that will cause future generations to deal with problems and creat other problems. Its better if this s**it species that exists for no f ing reason other than their parent s makeing a mistake or worse, an accident because they forgot something or did it in the front hole. So stop romanticising this nonsense because all those others are here for no reason and immorally given their life was given. Recklessness combined with the animalic instinct to reproduce is a combination for the creation of a total mess. It has no reason, its excruciatingly painful to many hundreds of millions of people. So consider  them as non existent to avoid certain  unnecessary suffering that everyone will feel like never happened, after they die. So don t cause more"
2,As for caring and sharing. I am not likely to be open to someone i don't know well.
1, doesn't seem realistic to my experience at all lol
2,"Good, More crisis"
2,this was a great analysis on friendship
1,"I joined an archery club because it always interested me but I was the only person there my age and they lived, ate and breathed archery. Everything they did was based on archery. They turned something i enjoyed and relaxed with into a pure competition. People are hard."
1,I moved away from my university town where most of my friends are to be closer to my ex’s dying mom and live near both our families. He financially and emotionally abused me and we broke up. I want to move back but my credit is ruined and I literally have -1000 in my bank account because I quit my job to live back here and haven’t found another one yet. After the legal separation I want to move back near my friends. I love my family but they are really unstable and my friends are a better support system especially emotionally. crying_face The one good thing is that my ex alienated a lot of our shared friends so I do have people to talk about it with who know both of us well. That has been super helpful red_heart

1,Do why i get no play next please
1,"Since before the pandemic, I spent years going new places, trying to talk to new people, trying to reconnect with old friends. Some friends drive past my house everyday, and I'll ask if they want to stop by and have a 5-10 minute conversation once in a while, and I haven't seen them in over 8 months. Other friends I'll invite to go out somewhere, to no replies. I've tried for many, many years, in many different ways to meet people, and I've lost the drive to reach out. My schedule is pretty open and I am able to make changes to spend time with people, but whenever someone does get back to me it usually goes like this..

Friend: ""Hey, when we hanging out?"" Me: ""Tomorrw?"" F:""Busy"" M:""Next day?"" F:""Busy."" Me:""Next day."" F:""Busy."" M:""Next day?"" F:""Busy."" M:""Okay.. So when are you free? What works best for you?"" F:*doesnt answer for 3 months* 
And that is the bulk of my friendships, and why I stopped trying. 

'Friends' are the only real option since most of my family is dead, or just doesn't remember who I am. Hell, at the last family reunion, everyone asked my sister who I was, and if we were dating.."

1,"It took me along time to realize I DON'T need lots of friends actually, there just isn't enough advice for extreme introverts. Sometimes the best advice isn't the ""generally good"" advice."

1,"Is true that there is places where introverts like me don’t fit, so is sad to discover how many people thinks going to a club and crowded places is the way to socializecrying_face"
1,"but what if you ARE boring? what if you work so much in a job you have no interest in but don't have the ability to quit or change jobs due to financial stress that you have no time for hobbies, interests, studies, sports, etc. and so all you do is work and sleep. How can you make friends when you have no stories to be able to tell (because no one wants to hear your best story even, when all it is, is the time you found a $10 note on a sidewalk), no jokes to tell, no real world experiences, not having traveled anywhere and can't because of finances. Just a bed and a boring job punching numbers into the infinite?"
1,Who else got this as recommended..
1,"Once again I am late to the game. But I appreciate your persistence, Kurzgesagt Crew. I hear you loud & clear. It's crazy I'm at this point in my millennial life but it totally relates to my unconscious cries for help. Even when help is given. Thanks again."

1,"i feel personally attacked, but you aren't wrong Mr. Kurzesagt pleading_face"
1,"Thank you for sharing specific advice on how to connect with people, not vague platitudes like ""be yourself"". I've learned a lot of the things in this video through trial and error, but it took a long time - I'm 40! I wish I'd had a resource like this when I was younger to point me in the right direction."
2,yoooo new video an hour ago :33 i hope i can make friends now
1,"But how can we do all that with so little time 
It really seems impossible when you didn't really secure a good future and a money income (either a job or a freelance or anything)"
1,Thanks for the tutorial bro!! now i can grind social exp and actually have a life!
1,"This makes me think they should somehow fit this information into general education, especially with the pandemic lock down. These kids have never had to maintain friendships before they need some help!! I needed some, I needed this video tbh!! oh how I wish I saw ANY kurzgesagt video in highschool"
0,"I don't have many friends.
Very few people like Barcode Battlers."
2,Make few friends not more but good
1,why did you reccomend this to me susan
1,"Love the 40K reference! I discovered an entire new group of friends via this hobby. I have a wife, two kids and own a business so my time is limited but you’ll find the 40K community is made of many with similar situations, and they understand. Don’t paint alone!!"
1,"I have lot of friend of my college,school whom you ate in 2019"
2,didn't have to expose me like this damn
1,"I dont know where do you live but in my country, local gyms are exact place to find new friends. I recomend everyone."
1,"Finally, a video that actually teaches me how to make friends."
2,"This video forgot to mention that it is perfectly okay to be okay with not having friends. If you are truly okay with it then don’t let videos make you feel bad because they tell you that you “should” do things and if you don’t you will be worse off. And remember, true friends are hard to come by. Not just doing things but successfully “going through” things together is a great way to prove to each other that your friendship is true."
2,Most of my friends I made in my late 20s. And I love them so much.
0,"how do you know if you’re lonely? i’m married and have a kid, but my best/only friend just died. i don’t feel lonely at all. can i be lonely and not know it?"
2,"Eat your friends, eat them all."
1,"I went to an elementary and middle school that connected to each other, so there were many people I had known for more than 5 years. However I moved to a different high school, so I lost so many connections that were years in the making because I felt too scared to reach out again. I also feel like all of my high school relationships are surface level because I don’t try to make them deeper; since I didn’t have to try as hard to befriend my previous friends whom I had known for years and naturally became closer."
2,I wish I had people that want to be my friend but everyone in my school thinks I am annoying and in the way of there friendship so they invite me to sit with them at lunch  but don't talk to me

1,"Due to the cost of living, people are going to work longer to make ends meet. There will be no time to meet and socialise."
1,"I went to a new school and i just feel as if everyone has more friends than me.. i've always been really socially akward, to the point that i can't even say hi to someone without making it akward. Even when i try talking to people they just don't really care about me enough to be friends. Plus now i'm having trouble with the closest person to me who is my lover, it turns out they are a toxic person for me. everything is just going wrong and i feel like i'm just a stupid akward person who dosen't deserve friends.. i literally can't talk to people nornally like everyone else because i'm so akward and i have stuttering issues too, i hate it so much and honestly i just feel like giving up."

1,"I just started university, moving to a new country. This video couldn't have been dropped at a better time for me. Thank you red_heart"
1,"It didn’t work, now what"
1,"For me it helped to always have a sense of not really carring all to much. I knew that if this didn't work I could just go back to reading and writing in my free time. This sense of having nothing to lose helped me to come over my shyness mostly. At least as long as I'm not with groups. But don't over do it, you don't want to seem as if you didn’t care for the other person"
1,This video made me laugh like who in there right mind would be happy to see me
1,University??????? Hahahaha yes if you are rich and you don't have to work a full time job while studying full time at the same time.
1,"Thank You kurzgesagtred_heart
your video always help me and give a new perspective to life"
1,Need this rn face_with_tears_of_joy like you read my mind
1,"Amazing video on a very critical topic, thank you"
1,Yeh..... Sorry. I just dont meet anyone i like anymore. All too opinionated and angry all the time. Obsessed with drama. Too self centered and narcissistic. Also like you said with kids. Time is a massive issue.
2,Top tip : if you're looking for a girlfriend it is advise to search for female friend in the first place. The love story will come after you create a great bond of trust.
1,"Huh, just recent my old friend from 10 years ago messaged me and seems that our friendship might be beginning anew. 

I have noticed for the last 10 years  I always keep my personal feelings to me and not reacting when people attempting to share their. This is a good way if you don't want to become friends with someonesmiling_face_with_smiling_eyes. I think I got used to be friendless."
1,"Could you make a video on a subject like ""if Africa suddenly develloped"" please"
2,"Who ever is reading this, I love you red_heart"
1,"The only thing i am fucking curious about is why the hell are videos like this on youtube feed, like what are you implying, all this just cause i watched some introvert memes."
2,"Thanks,"
1,You should make a video studying friendzone
2,Ah good timing I just realized I have no friends
2,This is so awesome. Thank you so much for doing this.
1,"Youve hit rock bottom if your here, or your genuinely a fan of this channel"
1,"I moved for my job right after college, and have always been an introvert. That was june of 2019, right before quarantine. I have effectively no social circle, limited transportation, and limited time. Thank you for this"
2,What are great video again. I feel like theres so shame around this topic which is flawed because its so common these days. good luck everybody
1,Me watching this knowing fully well I’m not going to take the advice:
1,I feel like a robot watching this
1,Its so true that people don’t put enough time into friendships. I’m very introverted and struggle with planning things and yet for some reason I’m always the one reaching out to my friends to try to hang out and do things together. When I think about it too hard it makes me feel like they just don’t care as much. Or maybe they have other friends that they’d rather hang out with than me (I only have like 3 friends and none of them know eachother). Sometimes I worry that I’m being too clingy. It makes me want to stop reaching out. What’s the point if they won’t do the same? Would they even notice if I stopped talking to them?
1,"Bro i hate this world, youre surrounded by more people than anyone in the past could ever imagine yet we are as alone as ever. I have no real friends, no love interest, nobody interested in knowing me, nobody for me to give my friendly or romantic love to. I feel this bitter feeling in my chest when i look at how real it all is, that i truly am alone. If i could choose to leave this world for a world where id have love, true friendships, healthy family, good job... a world as a paradise, i would fucking do it. The only reason i keep on going is my parents dont deserve to see me leave them after all theyve done for me. In reality though, i see no point in experiencing this world alone like this. No ambition, no job, not anything can shush this feeling."
1,"My problem is I dont meet enough quality people.  No, not arrogance.  I just dont want to interact with people who think cheating on a sig. other is ok, or littering is ok, or being unaware of how actions affect other people.  Hell, if you dont use a blinker I dont want to be your friend. 
I want to be around people who respect other people, who start from a standpoint of love and acceptance instead of suspicion and hatred.
Hard to find as an introvert with no money and no family."
1,Bruh my sister is shy and I send her this video to her now she madrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughing
1,"Honestly, making new friend sounds like a lot of work and spent time, and I kinda missed what are the real benefits.
Nice video though."

0,"Shame, regret, insecurity, social trauma, depression. With these powers combined I a Captain Lonely.




On a serious note, as a social r-tard, I am improving bit by bit. Work is a paradoxically the best treatment for my depression and social anxiety."
1,"My advice would be: You NEED to fit in. Stop being a snowflake and try your best to fit in. Only then can you be yourself and choose your friends accordingly. 

Also, get out of your comfort zone and ask, ask, ask, ask questions - in conversations and participating in class."
1,"Spicy food for extroverts, non spicy food for introverts wtf?"
0,My pee hurts
1,"I had no friends in highschool because I just kind of neglected that friendships don't just happen anymore like in elementary school. I threw myself into every social event in freshman year of college and met a ton of people, and found a small group I stayed in touch with over summer. It's so so nice to go into the school year this year knowing I have a friend group to build on"
1,How can i/you make a thread for italy ? if it is possible i mean..
1,"Just made a move across the country for school and this really made me feel hopeful. You guys seriously release a video when it’s needed without fail, and I appreciate the fate of the world making it that way."
1,"Someone please tell me how I made two friends in a 10 minute game than being is school for two weeks, high schools gonna be hardcrying_face"
2,I would like to say that if you are depressed and are making attempts at friendship you should be proud of yourself.   Trying to make friends is trying to survive and that effort is a good start.
2,This is vital. Thank you.
1,"As someone with autism, connecting with new people is very difficult. I hoped to find like-minded people at university during my bachelor with whom I could be friends, but there wasn't anyone with whom I shared many interests with and was willing to spend some time together outside of school. School always seemed a place to me where I could connect with people more naturally. Trying to connect with people other than at school induces a lot of stress and anxiety and stopped me from trying altogether most of the time.

I'm generally not into large social gatherings, but this worldwide Kurtzgesagt meetup seems a wonderful idea! I will most definitely meet like-minded people, so I'll think about it."
1,The fact that over 1 million people watched this video in 10 hours shows how many lonely people there are out there wanting to make a friend.
1," ""they don't realize until it's too late that retaining friendships demands regular energy"" hit so damn hard, this is what I've been telling my friends for years now, they all think calling once a year is high maintenance and every single one that has told me they can always make new friends ends up being miserable the very second they find out what real loneliness feels like. We live in the worst generation for friendships that has ever existed because of social media, we confuse texting as real social interaction, always talk about socializing but never actually do. I believe the reason for this is that social media contextualizes everything withing the frame of reference of the account owner and not the associated accounts, prioritizing your story over others. 
  More important than this: friendships literally contextualize your existence– if you were to die tomorrow, the only evidence you ever existed would be the work you left behind, and the collective memories of you that exist in your social circles. Friendships literally provide a low resolution back up of your conscious experience. My personal hypothesis."

1,Introverts: MORTALS!
1,I have really no friends. I am always lonely even though I'm 18.
1,"My eyes are sweating a little. 
I'm going through a ""everyone is busy so we're not hanging out as much""  phase and it's not easy. I hate Saturdays, because I look at IG and see everyone hanging out"
1,i was just crying about this and then this was published
1,"Broke out crying after this video, just made me realize I cant even seem to make friends when this video makes it seem so easy. Depression and Anxiety doesn't help either. But I'm trying to hang in there. Trying to be a better friend to myself before i can be a good friend to someone else."
1,"I really appreciate how kind this video was, it was actionable, full of positivity, and enjoyable to watch. I am going to reach out to my friend that I haven’t seen in two years."
1,Genuine question: what do u do if you are a diagnosed sociopath?

2,No need to expose me like that
1,I was unable to make friends from the first day of kindergarten through the last day of college.  It fudging improves because I got psycho/social help.  I swear that I had minor autism.
1,does this channel have some crazy stalking mind reading function cuz I was LITERALLY JUST pondering over how small my social circles are melting_facemelting_face mindblown
2,Thank you so much I love when y’all do mental health content
1,"I’ve always knew that Kurzgesagt videos were life changing, but now might actually will in a different way, I’ve already meet people from my city which has similar interests and is really nice, thanks for proposing your experiment, it’s really nice to meet new people, and all thanks to you, Kurgzgesagt! I’m purchasing the hoodie for the meet the next week."
1,"The timing on this video, I literally just got dumped by my friends and was forced to eat alone."
1,"I used to have maybe ten or so people I'd consider friends, over the years you see which are the ones that actually stick with you. I am happy with the 4 close friends that are with me now, and I wouldn't trade them for anyone else."
1,"Hi, this video will help me a lot, as I am introvert and tomorrow I'm flying to a new city for my college, ty for making this video! <3"
1,Those tips are cool and all but what if someone's problem is more fundamental? What if someone can't even bring themselves to honestly care about others? Any attempts at starting conversation feel forced and disingenuous. They could spend years in someone else's company and still not make a friend that way...
1,"unpopular opinion: I wouldn't have minded having no friends, maybe it's just me"
0,"im in late 30s, moved overseas, its been 4 years, no friends no family here. Ill be dead soon"
2,"In 2019 my best and only friend stopped talking to me, so now I literally have no friends :']"
1,"I have theory that the US is a very lonely country. I moved to Mexico and things are completely different. It’s way more social, there’s always community trying to be built by people. 

For example, I’ve taken several different types of classes in America post college. Writing classes, exercise classes, acting classes. Everytime people just want to be In and out. 

In mexican culture, when you enter these classes you get the sense people are trying to build community and make friends"
0,I stopped feeling lonely when I removed people who choose to perpetually misunderstand me.
0,"friends are for the weak
( i wanna die)"
1,"I dont look for friends, if I make one accidentaly then fine but I wont search for them actively. Life teached me that more than 90% of your ""friends"" are temporary. I dont want to commit my emotions again just to be forgotten after some time."
1,"I was so gloomy the other day and I was on verge of crying. I always talk to everyone in class but yesterday when I was alone nobody approached me. I don't know how I can make friends in my present class bcoz no one seems interested about me. I also go through a lot of stress because more often than not, I am forced for getting best scores."
1,I prefer quiter sorroundings and fewer people but i also prefer spicier food. What does this mean????!!!!!
1,"I want science videos pls
sure philosophy is fun but are you doing this because it takes less effort to make"
1,"Aw dude, idk why I watched this. It's been 2 years since I've let my friends go, and now I'm just embracing it by keeping myself busy all the time. I hope I don't die sooner."

1,man... this really shows me what a miserable and lonely life im living here
1,How many people are even worthy of your friendship?  How many real friends do you need?  Maybe loneliness is a mental disease?  I can not relate to this video.  Guess I am happy with a few great real friends.

1,"""Introverts, often confused with shy people..."" SAY IT LOUDER PLEASEsparklessparklessparkles"
1,Now this is something i can relate to
1,This hit way too close to home
1,So the birds are confirmed ducks?
2,No friends > toxic friends
1,"idk i'm in my 20s now and i've only ever had one friend in my life and it was in elementary school. atp i feel like i'll always be alone, mostly because i've been alone for so long that i don't know how to socialise. it's pretty sad because feel this void inside that i can't fill"
2,No ty I rather stay lonely
1,This actually couldn’t have come at a better time for me
2,As an Introvert it is really hard to make any friends not just as an adult but since childhood. We must realize that having no friends is okay and normal. We also need to learn to enjoy on our own. That's the best thing you can learn.
1,"Would also say if you're looking to meeting up with a group but never find the times align with all of them, and end up seeing none of them, 'secretly' message one person before / during the organisation and say shall we just meet up anyway on X date. Quickly happens that once a date is in place, a) at least you meet with one person b) people quick latch on or even drop their other plans. The people who didn't make it will then make more effort for the next one, oftentimes with a bit of their fomo could only be a few weeks away and you get a double meetup"
1,"It's really difficult to maintain friends for me, it's always me that have to ask for the other, pretty none of my friends call me or ask me to do something"
1,Friends...... Probably should see this later when i have some
1,"Yes to all these but then theres this one person who can freely go around and connect to people and severe ties to them to their will, introverts who can also act like an extrovert when needed, swimming in the sea of the social world. They literally come and go and they feel so free, no one ever judges them any extremely, like theyre there suddenly, and it isnt even questioned, their opinions are taken into consideration, and they contribute something then just disappear suddenly and you just see them being together with anothe group, its like theyre everywhere! and everywhere they go, their existence is accepted."
2,Thank you very much victory_hand
2,I had a friend once..........
1,"Sigh


Get out of my head."
1,"As a person who has just experienced, breakups, loss of friends, anxiety and depression on a weekly basis for months now, I feel empty and alone, but this might help me. I'll watch it when I get a chance, I don't want to pay anymore for mobile data then I have too. Love you guys, you always make those lonley evenings that more fun!"
1,"Man it's been so hard to connect with people in college after the pandemic. I wasn't able to make friends in the early years when many people in my grade had classes I'm common. Now I'm in my last year and my schedule barely matches up with anyone. I have 1 friend and two acquaintances, but we never seem to have time to deepen our relationship"
1,"If friends wouldn't live so far away and my energy levels weren't so low constantly, i am tired by just existing and social interactions take much for me

I need nap buddies xD"
2,true friends apear after college graduation.
0,This video feels like a personal attack.
1,Expectations in friendships hurts. Usually in a friendship one person puts all the efforts but the other doesn't and the 1st one expects other to put on the Same efforts. Which hurts like hell and makes the person lonely slightly_smiling_face
2,"This just straight up made me cry, thank you for this"
2,Thank you I’m going in to middle school right now so thanks
2,This was so helpfull.
1,The real joke of the human experience is non-social people who don't really want friends but can still feel lonely.
2,Love the warhammer 40k refrence
1,Whoop
1,I don't really know how to speak the language correctly i never get invited or included in events im just left out they all ignore me when i talk
1,Great advice. One issue is that we have to work all the time to afford ourselves a place to live. And before that we had to study just as much. Nothing surprising if you take into account a wage gap that exists between your generation and ours. And now with this inflation caused by irresponsible decisions made by your gerention - we have to work even harder . Life turned into older people basically exploiting us.
2,Nothing helps me
1, I'm in the video :D
1,"@Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell
It is all fun and all being positive about making friends.
But you have to put in the effort to give people the same amount of tips to protect them self from UNFRIENDLIEST friends AKA: Enemies."
1,"It scares me how timely this video is.
Every semester in college, I find it harder and harder to find time and energy to make friends and I find myself alone during the vacations... I guess I should act now before I get stuck in the loop again.....Thank you kurzgesagt"
1,"I always try to make friends when I meet new people; I've met diiferent people every year because I study in different classes at school, but I just don't get related to any of them. I'm very extroverted and open to know new things, so I do the things people invite me to do (like dance songs that I don't enjoy), and it ends up beeing fun, but it doesn't last long. I laugh with them, I get to know them, but I lost touch with them quickly, because we just don't have much in common. I fell like I should move away to see if I can find people totally different to try to make real friends."
1, Fun fact! Ducktown is actually a real city in Tennessee!
1,"Thank you, it´s amazing how liberating these videos are!"
1,"The pandemic actually brought me CLOSER to my best friends.  As adults, we often got wrapped up in our own lives and met less and less.  Then, with all other social options closed, we just made a discord server for the 5 of us to regularly chat, started doing board game nights, and we were hanging out a LOT all of the sudden again. :)

Which is important to me, because, having moved away to a city where there are few people who speak my primary language (Something that makes casual conversation a bit harder), my opportunities to socialize, even as the pandemic finally calms down, are pretty limited.  :s

But hey, at least now my best friends and I still make SOME time for each other on the regular, and the guys at work are all pretty great people.  :)  For an introvert like me, that's about enough."

1,Early >:]
2,"I have many people I could call once a week or have small talk with but no one to share my joy or pain with. Friendships are so simple, so simple to take care of and to ruin. Sympathy and pity will gain you attention but it won’t gain you the kind of selfless friendship you want. Assumptions, pretentiousness, greed, anxiety, so many things to ruin relationships but I know one thing for sure, if you keep improving and are true to yourself, if two people are honest, communicate their feelings and admire each other, a relationship or more so a friendship will prevail. Stab people in the front if you have to."

1,"This video was posted exactly when I was feeling really lonely and depressed after watching a youtube vlog of my colleagues who were having a farewell party for a friend who was going to another country for further studies. They gave him a lot of gifts, warm hugs and smiles, a lovely photoframe with group photo. I'm so fkin sad rn, i just thought all I did in my life is sat on internet with my lazy hardcore introverted ass. I feel I'm an autistic person cuz that explains all of the wrong things been goin wrong in my life lately like not being able to make friend or speak to anyone properly, always becoming cornered and stand out from crowd like some ""weirdo"". A single step outside home makes me awkward full of anxiety. I wish i had friends like that who invite me to parties and things like that. I've never ever been in a party or had a gf. And o swear I'm super Humble and an empathic person. I donno if anyone in thos world gonna read my unnecessary crying shit or not still I'm writing this cuz it feels a bit good. Seems like my youth is wasted frdisappointed_face"

1,"The first part regarding proximity reminds me very intimately of the dialogue from a chapter in 'Night in the Woods' aptly titled ""Proximity"":

Mae: ""Do you think we'd be friends if we weren't, like, stuck together in the same town? Like we were stuck together in Girl Scouts? Like... uh... is this just... what's the word?""
Bea: ""Proximity?""
Mae: ""Yeah.""
Bea: ""I don't know. I honestly don't. My entire life feels like running after something that keeps moving away into the distance, while I stay in the same place... and I guess proximity counts for a lot right now."""

I hate ants, but I know they are vital to many food-chains.

I think it would be educational to show that while they may be hated, what would happen if they were truly gone"
1,"Another tip for making new friends for those who like a more structured method to meeting people: go to networking events. ""Networking"" is just the stuffy, corporate word adults use for ""meeting people"". Seriously, it's basically just a formal party, albeit one where everyone has to be super polite and there's a power structure involved.

If you meet someone you click with, exchange contact info and follow-up, either during break times at work or after work. Eventually, if you feel a deep enough connection, you can even start really hanging out with them and become real friends by inviting them over to your place or to some non-work group event (e.g. board game night)."

1,"I don't want to make any friends , the people we call friends are mostly opportunisist and will ruin your life . I have been deceived many times I don't want to be a fool anymore. I just talk business with my classmate . Nothing more than that , nothing personal . If you want to live a good life live a solitary life, do not emotionally depend on anyone, they will take the opportunity and torture you . So , beware. Make yourself strong so that no one can break you . That's what hermits do . You have to be a social harmit , live in the society but isolate yourself ."

1,"I needed this. I waste so much time on social media, it's time I take some moves and try to meet people in the real world. Thanks Kurzgesagt!!"
1,The fact that it’s on top trending is concerning
1,"I haven't had friends since childhood. Somehow I have a wife though, and i truly think that's the only friend I need.

I can't stand socially interacting with people. Physiologically I'm just in so much discomfort from my anxiety, which heavily handicaps my cognition. From the outside, it just looks like I'm a bump on a log, not really enjoying/engaging with the situation. 

Which is true. I am a bump on a log, and I can't stand being the outlier dragging down an otherwise fun situation... So I decide to not punish others (and myself) by avoiding these situations whenever possible.

If anybody ever invites me anywhere, like for work events, I don't want to be that guy that keeps weasling his way out, so I'll go. But people will quickly learn that a person like me isn't somebody you'd want in social situations where you ought to be having fun. So if someone is foolish enough to invite me somewhere, they usually learn to not make that mistake again haha.

I'm great at professional events where I just need to get my job done. The small talk and social outings? Not so much...

Am I lonely? A touch, yes. Does it suck? Maybe a little... But it pales in comparison to how I feel when interacting with others, which is absolutely abysmal. The feelings are deeply rooted in my fear of humiliation and rejection, and I'm in therapy for it, but the thing that sucks about personality disorders is that you don't really fix them, you just try to dampen the symptoms. So sadly I don't think I'll ever be able to just interact with others without this handicap always being present. Tried anti-depressants with no luck. CBT helped my trichotillomania, but that's literally it haha."
1,"I used to have trouble socializing, because I didn't know what to say or do. Board game nights helped me tremendously, because the games came with easily understandable rules and expectations. Within that context, I could relax and connect with fellow players, and develop friendships and skills that worked outside the context of the games as well.

I also found the science of emotional connection as explored and explained by developmental psychologist Gordon Neufeld to be very illuminating. It helped me understand my own needs and feelings, and how to act upon them."
1,I'm a-okay for having no friends since I'm in Junior high until now and I'm getting used to it.
1,"I lost my best friend of 14 years this year. It was pretty rough they didn't die or anything but they hurt me alot and I can't forgive them, not yet atleast I usually don't hold grudges so who knows"
1,"After leaving my hometown for work 4 years ago I look around and see that I'm mainly alone in a city where I'm still a stranger. I really do regret leaving a lot of my good friends behind in Montreal, acquaintances here never feel the same since they have only known me for so long."
2,Friends is more important than money
1,"I made some great friends during high school, but I never realized how great they were until they were gone. Now I wish I could go back and prioritize those friendships instead of slowly pushing them away. It seems like it's harder to make friends now then it was back then, and it doesn't help that I have more anxiety then I did back then. I never knew how much friendships could impact mental health and now that I do I truly wanna make some long term friendships before it's too late."
1,WAIT! I like spicy food and I always considered myself a introvert. Maybe I am an extrovert after all!
1,I prefer anonymity and staying to myself. I've never felt the urge to make friends in fact that gives me anxiety just thinking about it. I love being alone with my pets. Guess I'm weird.
1,I looked up the subreddit and it's just so wholesome to look at this people planning to meet each other and possibly making friends. Thank you kurzgesagt
1,"I'm not lonely because of no friends. I'm lonely because of no girlfriend. Very different things. I mostly just tolerate people, but the reproductive biology essentially forces people to be together in order to feel good."
1,"I have found making friends to be bothersome and not worth the effort. The area I live in is filled with people who have interests and even morals polar opposite to my own despite growing up here. Making online friends is nice but they come and go so often I don't bother getting attached. I've also found that I have a very disagreeable personality, and few generally want to be around me even when I try to be as nice and caring as possible. Literally bending over backwards to help people. Its been a struggle of mine for a long time to make good friends since grade school. So I gave up. I have acquaintances at work and that's about it. I have found that society as a whole generally will not accept me, and I am not about to conform to what my local population likes to do because I find their activities boring and morally revolting."
2,Recommend to me right after my best friend for a year did something I can’t forgive and I had to leave them. Ty for the restart
1,league of legends
1,"I switched schools 2 months ago and then switched again a month later. Now I basically only go to coaching where its studying all the time and I'm finding it really hard to find friends. Especially, considering that everyone has a busy schedule nowadays and I can't find a common topic to relate to or talk about. But I hope I'll be eventually be able to make friends because I am aware and conscious about and thus am making somewhat of an active effort. It's been so long since the last time I made a friend and I don't even remember how it happened. I'm also a bit on the shy side so its mostly people reaching out to me from the other side."
2,"You know, it's videos like these that reassure my love for this channel."
1,The fact that this is on trending is just scary
1,Is Kurzgesagt finally learning his main demographic?
2,'How to Make Friends' feels like a WikiHow title.
0,"Damn, they hit hard with this video"
1,"there is one thing I disagree with in this video.. at  you should have left ""in the real world"" out. that actually felt quite degrading towards me and my group of online friends. hanging out online can be just as good. and makes it easier to find like minded ppl. we talk almost every day and do multiple livestreams every week. some talking about dumb ppl, strange news and some are gaming streams. and i have never felt more connected to ppl then to some of them. even compared to my best friend in (high) school or even my family."
1,It was not the pandemic but rather our response to it.  Locking down was foolish and with predictable results.  No one should have the power to lock anyone else down.

1,I needed this video. Thank you Kurzgesagt.
1,In One of my worst moments this video was recommended to me....I am convinced this is a simulation .
2,Bold of you to assume I know what friends are.
2,This video has a massive flaw: there's no mention of the fact that it is better to have no friends than bad friends. How can you leave that critical detail out???
1,I used to have a freind called zyhyn but we are not freinds anymore
1,"I never was up for friendships. I avoid crowds and gatherings. I always connect to one person only: to a partner, who is also my best friend. I have lost several over time and was then completely alone for a while. These connections are rare but very intense. I don't want anything else."
1,"In my opinion, Kurzgesagt really need to discuss more about human and its interaction. I really got new points of view after watching this."
1,Didnt really thought that my life will get me to a point where i have to watch youtube to learn how to make friends
2,"I have no friends and I feel perfectly fine, is this normal?"
1,I would love to have friends but at the same time i am just too tired to keep up with all these personalities and feelings. I can barely keep up with myself
1,"Here in The Netherlands (not speaking for all, just what i've experienced), it seems like the only way to get friends is to go to parties and get drunk.

As someone who doesn't like how busy parties always are and also doesn't drink, i have way less things to ever talk to anyone about.
it's always about ""oh have you seen this at that party"" or ""dude he was throwing up constantly"", not to mention the judgement when people ask if you've drank anything in the weekend and you answer with no.

In my entire college career, i've only met 1 other guy that also doesn't really care for the partying and getting drunk.. 1!
and that spread over 4 years of a class with 30 guys and multiple classes around the same study (thus we mix up quite a bit)"
2,"Fun fact: 3 of my friends now have betrayed me for no reason, and I have serious trust issues! Scratch that, 4 not 3."

1,"Well, guess what? Who told you that I need any?"
1,"I once lost a friend in school, he was all good one day, then randomly left all our groups, avoided me in school, and at basketball training + games. (I play 2 teams, this is important.) 

It all comes down to his parents. The team he played with me in was not really important, the one that was, he was in a lower team than me. His parents got all jealous, and even moved to a different team the following season. His dad would sort of harass my mother at school events, but not enough for any sort of lawsuit. *His* mother would just talk shit and spread rumours about us. I know all this because they weren’t very good at hiding this. 

They even went as far as saying we *paid* to be in a higher team. It’s just annoying, I had other friends, but my best friends was pulled out of my life because his parents didn’t like that I was in a higher team than him. This meant they would hate us for the entire rest of the school year. Shit’s stupid."
1,"Funnily enough, I really re-learned how to get to know people during the pandemic.
This is a good video, and it's got lots of advice, especially if making friends doesn't feel natural to you. I'm no expert, but I certainly feel that my enjoyment of own life improved significantly when I started to reach out to people and to go to events and social gatherings. 
I did see another comment pointing out a certain challenge, and I've seen this in other comment sections about friendships and other interpersonal relationships. Essentially it's about the fear of rejection or never having felt love before. Now, I certainly hope that's not the actual reality many have been faced when, even when looked at from all angles (not all forms of love can be seen, sadly). But this is perhaps my best advice, and bear in mind that I have only the best of everyone in mind when I write this; I don't mean to be preachy, but rather just to offer what I can of the experiences I've had:
If you're lonely, I know it can be really scary and you might feel it's probably not worth it at all, but you should probably try some of the things in this video even though you're scared.
Take it from me; most people mean well. Really well, even. There are going to be awkward and painful moments in your life, but you'll never know what an abundance of potential good friends are right outside your door until you step outside your shell. Before I started opening up to new people, here's what I had faced, and I know everyone's experienced are different, but this is just to give context:
The world was ravaged by a pandemic that could kill. My parents are old, and so I was particularly worried about their well-being. 
Two years earlier, my first romantic relationship had ended. But the next half a year was going to prove so much more hellish than anything I'd experienced (and it had to do with said relationship). 
Most of my best friends had moved elsewhere in the country, and they were a huge part of the only sources of comfort I had. God dammit, am I grateful to have them. But I didn't have many nearby, that I could meet face-to-face. 
I severely messed up in my academic pursuits, and honestly, covid only made it so much harder. It was a real blow to my self-esteem.
I was feeling pretty dejected and lonely, but I heard somehow that there was going to be a gathering of people nearby, with people from my institute. Now, I didn't really know anyone there, as I had spent the past couple years by myself a lot. I didn't really know what to expect, but I figured it was worth a shot. Who knows, they might not be nice people at all, but I didn't really have much to lose anymore. And holy shit, people were nice. I was kind of the odd one out, knowing next to nobody there, but I eventually learned a couple names. It was a pretty fun evening, sitting around a campfire at night.
Now, two years later, I'm so glad I went there. Heck, I'm kinda glad I didn't get my degree immediately; I may not have gotten to know all those wonderful people, and to some extent, I maintain a lot of those relationships today. I see them sometimes at events and such or at the institute, and I'm so glad I just tried to make friends.
Make no mistake; I was terrified of people. I hadn't made many real friends the past five years at least, so I was a little out of practice. But you just have to be you. Learn through the people you meet. 
It's like swimming; sometimes you just have to jump right in. And I am terrified of larger bodies of water. But I'm all the better for it; I know now that I can swim :D
I fully believe you can swim too if you just give it a try, in as safe an environment as possible. But you have to try to expand your comfort zone at least a little. It could really help you. Or not. You don't have to take anything I wrote seriously, but I do believe it's good advice. And I hope it'll help someone out there. Take care, y'all!"

1,"Thank you for this Kurzgesagt. The self isolation during the pandemic killed my already mediocre socializing skills from before, I've recently transfered into a foreign university surrounded by different cultures and backgrounds. At first I laughed at the thought of me struggling to socialize pre-isolation because of online interactions like chatting, video calls, and bonding through games but boy was I wrong."

0,You can be alone but should not lonely...
1,"These past two years, I feel like I've lost many friends. I still see them every few months, but my two best friends moved out of my city this year and my boyfriend broke up with me.
I hope this year I can meet new people and start again, but I don't want to get my hopes up in case it doesn't happen.
The worst part is that I feel lonely even with my family. It's hard to connect with them and be ok.
It just feels like I'm a dark shadow in a room, sucking people's joy. I wish I could just choose happiness but a lot of the time, I just find myself so uncomfortable and sad.
I miss who I used to be before the pandemic."

1,For my entire adult life my focus was trying to get some alone time because it was always lacking.  Then my kids got older and more independent and the pandemic happened and I realized I now lack friendships.  Gotta figure out how to reverse my inclination because I've realized I really do need some friends (stupid thing to have to realize I know).
1,I mean I just hang out with a friend so I’m actually good but like why is Kurzegast always so on point with my recent mental state
1,I think youtube  is trying to tell me something
1,"Please , in spanish this video ."
1,"This is anecdotal but my perspective. I had lots of friends, was able to get along with everyone. I was able to find a common thread and build on that. What I found is that the older I got, the less tolerant I became of the indifferences. The drama, the demands, the expectations, all lead to me being extremely content with being more alone. Not lonely though. I can still strike up conversations with anyone, anywhere and have people asking for my number or wanting to get together. But I prefer arm length acquaintances with no bs, drama, and etc"
1,"Fantastic Peter Gabriel reference at  stay classy, kurzgesagt smiling_face_with_sunglasses"
1,"""Human brains are hardwired to seek connection"" - Says the norm pushing video. Growing up as an aplatonic aromantic asocial introvert, being alone was awesome. It wasn't until my late 30s that I *decided* I wanted to try something different. I had no natural desire to have friends or love or anyone. Is this video trying to claim I'm not human or that I don't fit the mold, so I'm ""broken"" in some way? The only thing natural for me is that anyone I so happen to be close to I care for. Which is the reason I decided to change myself. I care for my wife and I think we need friends. Which is an investment because if I'm going to be a friend to someone, I'm going to care for them."
1,why upload this during start of school semester sighh
2,making friends when you have social anxiety is hard
2,Thank you Kurzgesagt for this video
1,"I've always considered friends not just people you get on with at work or shared hobbies and interests but someone you'd hang out with outside of that shared setting and without that being the reason you're meeting up. 
To that end I have a few acquaintances via work and hobbies but only one friend I've had since childhood.
However since having a sapling, he having two plus lockdown and conflicting job hours the weekly hangouts have dropped to maybe 3 a year and it can be a frustrating effort to even make those happen. 
Still the good thing with old friends is eventually when things change you can pick right up where you left off."
2,"This sounds too hard...
This video was good info though thanks!"
1,"there was no need for a lockdown that destroyed millions of life's not saved them ,not that bad now and the same virus is still there it helped no one what world governments did to us"
1,Last year I made a post on a local Facebook group looking for a friend. I was tired of being alone even though I’m married I wanted to have a guy friend I could consider a best friend and be able to joke and talk to like I used to in school. I got tons of responses on my post and ended up finding a new best friend who is a bit older than me but nonetheless a great friend and I’m happy I went out of my introvert way to put myself out there.
1,"The thumbnail has changed from ""Too Few Friends"" to ""Make More Friends"""

1,Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Don't waste it.
1,This is such a coincidence I'm having difficulties making friends because I'm an introvert and I have social anxiety and I do feel lonely and this notification just pops up it's such a coincidence
1,"I'm sorry, does anyone have a source on introverts not liking spicy foods???? wot?"

1,"I’ve actually just moved to college and I now spend most of my time alone, which is the exact opposite of what I was like in high school. I started feeling lonely, and then this video came out. Thank you."
1,I'm always around people but they're people I'm not very comfortable around with. So all my energy is spent on just trying to coexist.
2,Be your own best friend and you will be just fine.
2,Is there a friend for me?
1,"after school and college i lost all people i know i don't consider them a friends but just people i know and i live in very poor city and we don't have Places of entertainment except the gym and nothing else 
so it's really hard too make friends for me"
1,It is sad that we need these type of videos in today' society. It shows how ill our society is.
1,western liberal values destroy families and friends

1,my mother said i need to make more friends at school and then I saw this vid a few hours later. i hope this helps me and other introverts.
1,Strange since i never had friend for 4 years it seems like i never been affected of loneliness
1,I would say I have few friends but I don’t feel lonely. I am lying to myself?
1,"Wauw as expected, this video is very abelist"
1,"Another helpful tip is establishing regularity. I think a lot of adult friendships fall into a “Let’s catch up once or twice a year whenever one of us feels like taking the huge initiative to contact the other,” when instead it could be “Let’s chat/grab dinner/play video games/etc every Friday/once a month/etc.” Having a regular thing that you can count on and look forward to does WONDERS in relieving your loneliness, not to mention your friendship and overall happiness."

1,"""oh it takes... TIME?"" ...I'll pass..."
1,"Apparently this was posted moments after a lot of people just went through this, but this literally happened moments after I ended a friendship after being lied to"
1,"Notice how he mentions just tik tok and not just all of social media, tik tok in my opinion is just bad for the brain on how lost you can be in just scrolling down and getting something mildly entertaining."
1,"I find this video a little bit... naiv. :3 sometimes you will do everything like in the video but miss the signal that your feelings are one-sided. And you will only annoy the others in the end and end up alone... Or you friends wills grow jealousy toward you and push you away... 
There is kindness in this world but not everybody is your friend, sharing hobby doesnt make you friends for sure.."
1,"I'm unsubscribing because you've been pumping bills gates' bags - we now know that the kurzgesagt channel has been spreading disinformation, sponsoring companies that bill gates has a vested interest in - you have deceived us, you have exploited us for the selfish gain of a billionaire

2,Who wants to be me friend?
2,"Stop cancelling plans, be present, friendship, like any relationship require some effort."
1,"I wanna talk to my old school friends, but i am scared. I've changed so much, and they must have changed too. I'm scared of what might happen.
I haven't have friends from 5 years now, since i graduated high school. I don't even know how to do this friendship thing anymore, i feel vulnerable, I'm scared to trust people, i feel too open, which is weird. Also, my lack of self steem and confidence are pretty clear to other people, what if they notice my failures? I'm scared.
I'm also scared to talk to old friends and revisit past, which i am scared about."
1,"My friends and I can go years without talking to each other and happily catch up as if we had spoke yesterday. 

I'd rather have 1 or 2 friends like that than have many acquaintances but maybe that's because I (and my friends) are rather anti-social haha"
0,All pretty worthless advice for an autistic that has been broken by every kind of people.
1,"i bes an introverted hermit type. I have my wife and like 3 or 4 good friends. i have dozens of acquaintances and people I interact with on a regular basis but only a few people I call ""friend"". and I actively work to maintain my friends, while acquaintances come and go."

1,Now being only child the difficulty increases to hard mode.

1,"I do everything you say, whenever I thought I've a new friend because of years of relationship; studying together, going places, talking, playing, doing important stuff for someone; I always got left alone at the first oportunity they have. This haven't happened once or twice, at least 18 times, where 4 of them really hurt me a lot.
I'm 26 and I think I'm not gonna try it any more."
1,well this a video i hav been waiting my whole life.
1,"Congrats, you're one of the first People to comment early"
1,"Its especially hard if you are introverted and don't do well with small talk. All my friends basically faded away from my life probably because I didn't keep up with it. Now that I'm in my early 30s and moved to a new state for work, its basically impossible to make new friends. I've had nearly zero friends for the past 5 years."
1,"This channel is straight propaganda man. Yall used to be a great channel with no agenda. Now, its undeniably clear just how disgusting your agenda has become. And hate to tell ya. I'm apart of the MANY, not the few. Wake up before you lose all that ill gotten money"
1,"This is a very human video, and you can tell by the lack of birds. Amazing and beautifully done, as always."
1,"It's my last year of college, but so far I'm not satisfied with my social life. I do have friends, but every time I get to hang out with any of them, it just feels like a free trial membership because it is too short. I feel like everybody in my life right now is too busy to spend sometimes with me, and I don't blame them since in less than a year everybody is going to start a real adult life, and it's time for everyone to take it seriously. Before this, when we all had online classes, I didn't feel lonely as much as I do now. Now that we get to go back to college normally (almost), I somehow feel worse. I think it's because I had too many expectations before the semester started, and after the semester began, I realized that everybody was way too busier than I thought, and it kinda stung me a little. I've been feeling lonely and sad for a while now, and as I was thinking about how lonely I am, how badly I want to meet my current friends, and how I want to make new friends so bad, I found this video. This is relatable, and I would like to say thank you for giving me hope."
2,Thanks for your good contents
2,Well....I am my own friend.

1,Now what are you suggesting? thinking_face
2,who else needs a friend lol
1,"This past year I've opened up and strengthened a lot of old friendships as well as made a lot of new ones. Genuine people with problems of their own who I love to share time with. 

You're never alone. Don't delve deep into the hole thinking no one cares, because there are definitely those who do. You just need to take that leap. You might get burned but it's worth the risk."
1,"There's literally nothing in here about detecting and avoiding narcissistic, psychopathic or manipulative, selfish people. Gaining friends is only worthwhile if you don't find yourself with a knife in your back someday, which is not a very desirable reward for all the hard work you put into making friends."
2,Thank you red_heartred_heartred_heart
1,How come Kurzgesagt always post videos that match my life situation rolling_on_the_floor_laughing Im being watched?
1,"I think that one of the MAJOR difficulties of making friends as a POST-college adult is that people their age have moved on to start families and careers. Another big thing is that with how EXPENSIVE it is to rent or buy a home. People would have to overwork just to make ends meet.

Another difficulty would be the suburban SPRAWL. Not only are you more isolated by NECESSITY, but for children, they are more isolated. I do NOT blame kids for staying at home all day playing video games."
1,"Hey Kurzgesagt, can you terraform the moon or other objects in space like large asteroids"

1, CATAN outstanding board game
1,"Weird how this appeared in my feed the same week that I've actually been feeling rly socially starved even for an introvert, even though i haven't seen a Kurzgesagt vid in months. I've actually been considering reaching out to some former classmates to hear what they're up to"
2,Superb Video! Really needed this !
1,"always so nice and positive, these videos. 

EXCEPT THE DARK FOREST ONE lol :D"
1,"Wanting more connections and needing them are two very different things. ""Hardwired to seek connections"", yet I've been a loner for so long and I'm pretty happy that way. I talk to people if they talk to me, and despite having a very broad, dark and sometimes almost misanthropic sense of humour, I wouldn't say I'm antisocial. For me it just means less problems to deal with, less energy to expend and more time to do what I want when I want."
0,Damn straight to the point with that title
1,I love how they never mentioned how puppet governments who locked down most countries in the world and forced face masks on us are the ones responsible for kids having dozens of social development problems
2,"i love how he says ""shhedules"" lol"
1,Its so frustrating how lazy and disconnected people have become in the last couple of years.  Everyone needs to see this you will be so much happier when you go out and do stuff with people in the real world.
1,Social anxiety is my problem. I'm in my 50s with no 'real friends' so all the things you say in 'how to make friends' are all way too terrifying to attempt. So it's impossible. Also work from home. Good job I like my own company and are highly creative.
1,"I don't know if it's just me, but I've had a hard time making friends in college. Even after all the zoom classes, things just don't seem very conducive to friend-making; all I can do in most of my classes is show up, take notes, and leave. Even in labs where we have to work together, any interaction feels like it's being done purely to get the work done. ""Spending casual time"" with people feels difficult because my classes leave barely any time for that. In high school, you're stuck in the building for 7 hours a day, so that casual time is built in to the experience- lunch, time between classes, etc. But in college, class is really the only rigid part of my day, and my professors rarely leave time for anything other than learning. Even when people in my classes do talk to each other, it seems like they were already friends. Everybody either seems like they don't talk to anyone or are already in a pre-established social group, and I'm not sure how to bridge that gap."
1,This is the biggest roast ever
2,Friends just ditch you and treat you like a backup plan. No thanks.
1,I thought this was the kurzgesagt shitposting account
1,"Yeah, I'm not gonna do any of those things so... I'll have to learn to embrace living with no friends."
2,ok well you're just roasting us
1,"Gonna be honest, think this is the most difficult subject ever addressed on Kurzgesagt."
1,"I know keeping friends requires quite a lot of effort, which is why I've given up on it. School and worrying about my social enxiety and future takes up so much of my energy. Currently im in my last year in ""high school"" (i live in sweden and go to gymnasium, which is kinda the same) and i havent been able to make any friends because no one fits me and i suck and holding a conversation. Ive been so worried that i wouldnt make a single friend by the end of high school but now i dont anymore. I dont care if i make friends or not. Im just trying to focus on completing high school because that already takes such a toll on my mental health. I also find it quite ironic how this video ends up on my YT homepage, kurzgesagt definitely spying on me lmao"
2,"Every time I am not sure what next step should I take in my relationship with friends, I watch this. A truly big thank you for keeping me happy with friends."
1,These reccomendations are getting too personal...
1,They posted this at the start of school on purpose
1,where entropy video?
1,"Huzzah for modern designer board game groups. Highly recommend to anyone who might even be the tiniest bit interested. Board games have come a very far way from the days of Monopoly. Just like you don't think of Space Invaders or Pac-Man when someone mentions video games, so too have board games come that far. Check out some causal and popular ones like 7 Wonders or Wingspan to get your start. =)"
1,"Also, I would love to use this meetup to meet some potential new friends, except for some gods-forsaken reason I can't get Reddit to stop having seizures. I try to sign up and put in a username, and it keeps resetting it to its randomly generated craptastic shitshow. I literally cannot use this site. I can't even begin the process of trying to generate an account, let alone do anything with it."
1,"As a lonely man at 41 years old, a  farmer and  not really interested in todays society,   i miss my friends in my 20's and 30's.   They all habe families and moved on.   I still am single, and not really a fan of pubs and clubs... so finding company is difficult.  This was a great vid. Thankyou"
1,I cried.
1,"This might sound like a really weird tip, but as someone who was panicking from even the simplest social interactions not too long ago, it's something I would actually recommend. One thing that really helped my social skills was becoming a door-to-door fundraiser for a charity. The great/terrible thing about it is that people most often don't want to talk to you, which means you're forced to become damn good at understanding your interactions to keep them talking. It's a really great way to do quantity training for small talk. 

For someone like me, who was incredibly scared that others didn't like me, it was incredibly helpful to put myself in a situation where people *really* didn't like me and it showed me that, even if they didn't, it wasn't actually so bad.

And since you're doing fundraising, you don't have to think about what you should talk about, because you're payed / you've volunteered to talk about one thing in particular. So you can focus on delivery and conversational flow, rather than panicking about subject-matter. So you just choose a charity you want to talk about and go from there! 

Of course there were other things as well, but doing fundraising helped me to go from panicking while saying ""hi"" to people, to now confortably being able to do public-speaking for more than a 100 people at a time.

It's was incredibly stressful the first few times, but I wholeheartedly recommend it if you feel like you're in a similar place as I was"

1,What if I have a lot of friends and still feel alone
1,Kurzgesagt know their audience well
1,"This is a great video, and as someone who recently went through a friend breakup, I'm especially feeling this video hit close to home.

However, something not mentioned that I feel needs to be addressed is that neurodivergent people (ADHD/Autism etc) struggle a lot with social cues, and making friends for us can be 1000x more difficult than the normal person loudly_crying_face especially if said ND person is an introvert like myself."
1,"I'm perfectly fine without any friend or group whatsoever, I think it's perfectly normal to be like this either, sorry for not sounding like 99% of the comments here"
1,"I like the 3D animation of the dancin' dude. Why would the ""c"" in ""schedule"" be silent tho. Jk, nice stuff!"
1,Watching this as someone who has few friends and is content in that sense.
1,You also have a ton of people that will abandon you if your views slightly disagree now. I lost a friend of 22 years because he decided he didn't like my views out of no where.
1,Ironically playing the sims as a introverted kid taught me that relationships need to be built in short and long term; consistent interactions in the short term bar build up the long lasting bar of shared experiences that drains much more slowly. Personally I remember every single friend I've loved but fallen out of practice with over the years. If they ever showed up at my door needing help I would do it. I sometimes wonder if they would do the same.
1,Havent had a friend ever in my life. Sure some people Ive known at some point but no friends. All Ive got is my dog and parents.
1,"I decided to focus on daily Japanese studies a few years ago and now I'm fluent and have expanded the possibility of the number of people I can connect with. Learning a language is one of the most powerful, meaningful ways of expanding your potential friendships."
2,Well this was really interesting and I like it
1,People who I spend time with either grow tired of me or try to manipulate and take advantage of me so nah i'm done with humans and this failed attempt at an intelligent civilization.
1,These videos make me really happy. Thank you.

1,"I think the pandemic (among other things) has really exacerbated loneliness for a lot of people. It's something I struggle with daily. I go to the gym and do BJJ to keep myself busy but it doesn't completely distract me from the fact that I'm really lonely. I moved back to my small hometown after a bad breakup and for the last three years it's been a struggle. Just me, myself and I for the time being. Sometimes I just wish I could pack a bag and ghost but id still be me at the end of the day."
1,I don't know how to take this title and thumbnail without being offended by the truth
1,"I'm an ambivert, and never feel alone, tho I often miss people. Sometimes you just lost connection in your mind, like I don't use social media to socialize with people I can see in real life. I always prefer to get out and see then in person. We smoke together and sometimes have sex. Say non to the Zuccracy! Social media is the root cause of social dissolution. And never obey the government blindly, shouts to the party people that are always up to a party, even in the face of death and autority abuse. All hail freedom!"
1,Title of this video is the story of my life
2,This video actually made my life a lot better. Now I can actually make friends and expand my social circle. Thank you Kurzgesagt.

1,This is the most heartwarming video I have ever seen from you guys! It made me cry because I struggle with this everyday from being shy even at the age of 29 and feeling anxious about not bothering people to much and being a mother and having a family and working really does make making friends very hard for me. Thank you for this video not only did it gave me some great tips but also made me feel like I was not alone in this. Thank you!
1,I give up social interaction 12 years ago cause they rather left me than being patience that I'm not your everyday people
1,"How about the bare basics and everything will fall into place:
- Why you hell are you not taking care of your physical form you sloppy pig (the majority of the entire population is fat and/or out of shape)?
- Why are you shoving 4,000 calories down your throat?
- Why are you slouching? Is your vertebrae infused in the 'crooked position'? You can't stand up straight?
- Why are you not taking care of  yourself? You simply don't care?
- Ever consider dressing half way decent opposed to sloppy clothes like everyone in the US? 

Because when you start carring in life, and look the part, others that DO care will gravitate to you. And since those people have their chit together, it becomes a double win because you'd be better off surrounding yourself with people who have standards...not just 'any mewh person'."
1,"I always seem to struggle with forming close relationships. And it's not that I try. Because I try a lot, but people often prefer to keep friendships with me on surface level and I kinda don't get why. Especially when I can really get along with someone at a rave, I'm always like: ""We should hang out more often."" And they are like: ""Yes absolutely."" But I never get an answer when, or when I make an offer, I always get ignored. And they just end up being the cool person I occasionally see at raves (this is just an example btw.) This year there were 7 people supposed to come to my birthday, but I ended up celebrating it all alone because they all either canceled last minute or didn't say anything at all after they said they wanted to come. And this is not the first time. Like if stuff like this keeps happening throughout my life, then it does make me wonder why. Like what is wrong with me that people prefer to keep me as that surface level friend they hang out with when I just happen to be somewhere?"

1,"Anyone in the comments looking for friends to play splatoon 3 with when it comes out? 
I got a discord server but it's pretty chaotic, and it's only just me and a couple others. <3"
1,"The problem with the era of internet is now (young) people think they have friends but they don’t care about the individuals. They only want to spend time and make activities with people and not to be alone. I experienced it several times, people I spent years with, thinking they would be here when something bad would happen. But in fact, when you don’t fit anymore with the mood of the group, you are rejected. I experienced it when I became ill and couldn’t do what I did before with them. No one tried to change the ways we did the things so I could be a part of it again. I was expendable, and replaced with someone who could.
True friendships doesn’t exist anymore in this world"

1,"Reading most of these comments i feel sorry for those that never got got a chance to make good friends. Making friends right after highschool is hard but in my experience i actually meet my REAL friends AFTER high school. If you want to make a meaningful relationship you need to be real with yourself. Because most people now and days tend to put up an ""act"" in thinking you'll make REAL friends for the most part you''ll ONLY be getting temporary friends. make the actual effort when making friends my philosophy is friendships are like plants you got to water plants and nurture them the moment you stop taking care of your plants they will slowly wither and die off."

I did eventually get tired of it and forced myself to change. I am proud to say that now I live a richer life. The thing is, watching this video makes me wish I was better at managing my time and prioritizing friendships and family."
1,Basically Kurzgesagt is calling us lonely. What a cool science dude.

1,"I've been declining invitations for a while now but after seeing this I might just start accepting some of them.
I just don't think my interests align with those of the people around me"
1,"Over time I have fallen in love with just how Kurzgesagt makes their videos and the topics they cover with highly relevant scientific research, explaining it in a manner that is easily understandable and enjoyable. 
However, at  it says that most people would appreciate having someone who makes hangout plans or invites people. As a 19 year old college student, I can say this is definitely not the case. I do appreciate it when someone else invites me, but often I have noticed that people found it weird when I made plans with them after meeting them. I did not go out of my way and made a simple plan with few friends I met through a close friend. But now the entire group considers what I did to be awkward and weird and cancelled on me on the day we were supposed to go out, and then stopped talking to me and my other friend. 
And this wasn't a singled out case, I have had this happen to me so many times, that I have gotten extremely conscious when meeting new people or socialising. 
Maybe the research on that part is not relevant to today's times? I am not patronising or condescending the channel's work, I am simply pointing out what my experiences have led me to."
1,i love how the music in this video references the original “loneliness” video’s music

2,Having one close friend is all I need.

1,I lost all of my friends from high school. Then around my 20th birthday the world shut down so I still haven’t really got the chance to make new friends. It just sucks lol
1,"This video really hits me to the point. It really showed my way of changing from introvert guy in middle school to more open and extrovert guy in my 20ies. I found actually my 2 best friends in highschool. I am 22 right now and i am still with these guys i met about 5 years ago. First one is the guy i just met in highschool. We just shared the same ""existence"" problem with people which made us the best friends. Second one is more complicated. It's a guy which I know in my elementary school and at that time he was a bully for me (as I said I was more introvert type). Later, in my highschool I signed up for a German-Polish student exchange. Then I found out the old ""bully"" which was going the same school I did, he was also going there. I was dewasteded but still I wanted to go there. And how it turned out, he just invited everybody from exchange for the party. Then the whole world turned upside down. He changed a lot for that time. He just showed for me as a nice guy which you can talk about anything and ask for. So in the end it turned out this ""bully"" became my new friend. For the whole highschool I learned a lot about socializing. Just for the people scared to come out. Don't. You are missing a lot of opportunites. There will be always somebody who will share some interest with you, you just need to open up a little."
1,"Bro it’s really not that hard to make friends or have a gf/bf, u really just say f*ck it and put yourself out there ignoring what others say to you because you are your own self and have your unique style and way of doing things, it was hard for me to make friends in my early years because I had very strict parents and they never liked the idea of having friends and I only saw them at school which made me feel so apart because I never left my house and felt imprisoned but I learned how to socialize once I had my own car and reached a certain age and I started to put myself out there and decide to have fun with people, either poking at them lightly or sharing interests and personal life and I’ve never felt so much better, and for any guy or girl who feel like they are trying to impress their crush and they ignore you or dislike you, they are technically lower than you because they are so self centered and insecure whereas you are being your own self that no one can copy, I started to feel even happier when I started socializing and I learned a lot too about myself when I didn’t have friends and I did my own little hobbies like home workouts and playing guitar, be active and don’t become a hermit and I guarantee many people out there will appreciate you for who you arered_heart"

2,What you are describing is the feeling of missing God.
1,"Correction, those health problems are not linked to ""not having friends"", its linked to ""Being called a weirdo for not having friends"". 

There is no actual need for friends, we only think we need it because thats what everyone else does and is the ""cool thing to do"", just like smoking."
2,i think why god makes you have a shorter life when you are depressed is so you don't have to live through it for so long and go to heaven where there is joy
1," Those are the kind of people I'm looking for. I'm into weird movies like _Garfield Gets Real,_ and games like _Speedy Eggbert._ It's hard to find common interests when my interests are so obscure."
1,"In my opinion, you need to do something worth a friendship.
What I mean is, find like minded people whom have gone through/worked through identical endeavors.
It’s much harder if you’re an introvert who chooses a sedentary life."

Samaritans believe that the Jewish Torah, and Judaism, have been corrupted by time and no longer serve the duties that God mandated to the Israelites on Mount Sinai. The holiest site for Samaritans in their faith is Mount Gerizim near Nablus, while Jews view the Temple Mount in Jerusalem as their most sacred location.

The Samaritan religion:

Their principal canonical text and main norm of religious observance is the Samaritan Pentateuch. The Samaritan Pentateuch contains the basic text of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, yet there are about 6,000 differences between it and the masoretic Jewish version.

Why did the Judahites not like the Samaritans?

The Jews called them ""half-breeds"" and sent them home. The Samaritans built their own temple which the Jews considered pagan. The feud grew, and by the time of Christ, the Jews hated the Samaritans so much they crossed the Jordan river rather than travel through Samaria."

2,this helped so much :D I'm so glad you made this video! keep up the good work
1,"so true i must agree, I lost all of my real good friends because of my online gaming and chat, thought i had a good social network til i realized where i am today..."
1,And do stuff with then for only about 25 minutes a week.
1,"I'm so thankful I grew up before the internet took over everyone's life.  I learned everything in this video on my own, before high school.  There are so many more social lessons after this basic introduction... which should have included: social anxiety is pervasive, knowing that everyone else is too worried about themselves to be concerned with you, means you are free to let loose and enjoy yourself, within reasonable limits.  Especially when it comes to dancing."
1,Thank You Team Kurzgesagt for wonderful informations. folded_hands
1,"The societal pressure put on the importance of having friends makes people who find it very difficult to make friends feel even more isolated and upset ...  well this has been my own personal experience anyway . After years of trying and failing to make friends and trying unsuccessfully to maintain what little friendships I had , I just gave up trying and accepted who I was , and am much more content as a result !"
1,"Fun fact: if you don't say anything bad to a person, you're more likely to convince them. (There are people who don't know this)"
1,This video made me realise how pointless life is.
1,I should've watched this 15 years ago.
1,"I recently went through my phone to clear out any spam text messages, old unused contacts etc. I found out that I've been blocked by most of my friends. I've gone from having 12 friends to just 2. But those 2 have been with me through the worst times as well as the best. That's the sort of friends people really need."

It didn't seem much at the beginning, but now the concequences do show up"
1,I feel sad that this has do many views. Must be alot of mes around
1,"Its okay, Kurzgesagt. I already split my personalities into 2 so when im too lonely and nobody arounds, i can just talk with myself"
1,I've given up at this point and will make no effort to start any relationships and it's perfectly okay. That allows me to focus on what matters instead of being anxious about not having people to hang around.
2,Then there’s me. Everyone I knew collectively decided that I sucked to be around. They started avoiding me altogether after I addressed it. I now have 0 friends and can’t make any because I’m not good enough for them. I mean I wasn’t good enough for those who I called friends or even best friends. I just want it to end.
1,"Perfect timing for this topic, personally, thank you. I started uni in 2020 and I'm still struggling with how to make friends or basically any connection with people since, it's as if an important phase of my life was simply gone, even though I'm not a social butterfly."

2,Best help against lonlieness is joining the great minds in the Afterlife. If you are past 25 and have no friends like me. Start killing yourself slowly with Drugs or Stress.
1,"getting in touch with loneliness is too easy. joined the military about 11 months ago and haven’t seen family or friends since then, it just sucks moving from place to place over 1000 miles from home having to meet new friends all the time and lose friends to distance. 
      having that one friend you can just hit up whenever and is down to do whatever is nothing you should take for granted."
1,It's weird how emotional I felt while watching this even though I do have close valued friends that I see regularly. This just tugged at my heart anyway.
1,The intro just roasts you
1,"Idk about this. There's massive structural issues with our societies that atomise many of us. I'm a 40yo autistic person who lives alone and struggles to get even one day a week of social contact. My main issue is that because of the high cost of living and the threadbare welfare in the UK, I'm having to work much more than I am able to in order not to become homeless. This is exhausting me and making getting anything outside of work and looking after myself done extremely difficult. So it really isn't as easy as just switching my priorities - if society wants us to have friends and relationships (and it should: see falling birth rates, skyrocketing socioeconomic costs of poor mental health) it needs to support that instead of making it more difficult."
1,Bike ride wish we have thoose
2,Love the symbol of the plant representing friendships :D
1,"This doesn't include all people though, it's not a general thing. Most people feel lonely without friends, but there's a huge amount of people (like me) that are introvert. Which doesn't mean I don't like to be among friends, it also doesn't mean I'm dull at parties. It does mean I don't need friends to feel happy, nor parties. I can live fully remote and be happy, so it's important to highlight these people as well. All too many times I see kids in school, being introvert, criticized for not being more involved (parents get the blame as well for it), that's just very sad as it makes these kids feel weird and not accepted."
1,Why do I choose to be lonely.. the amount of friends I have ignored over the years.. strange life .
1, This is where I struggle. I've gone to so many clubs and met so many people and never found a single person who shared my interests.
1,"I'll say it again.
NO MONEY, NO TIME, NO FRIENDS.
A slave has no friends and a lot of us are just slaves."
2,This helps a lot
1,"Here another way for gamers:
Step 1. Play the game until  match someone (or in discord just request friend if they good
Step 2. After long good game ask him/her to be friends 
Step 3. If they accept you should treat them like friend
Step 4. After 5 days or weeks you should tell them to meet in real life 
Step 5. If they decline to meet in real life just track their IP address

Done thats how you make friends 100% easy"
1,"Kurzgesagt is salvation to me since the pandemic , I have been watching it since in the beginning of 2020 , thank you for all the efforts putting it into videos, kudos ."
1,I feel like my childhood experience being bullied led to my low motivation in social activities and building relationships.
1,"I am sorry what study is saying that being present in class without saying a word makes others sympathetic to you?
I mean sure I can't just say ""My experience was dead opposite"" as an example is no proof but I have met others who had the same issue of having no friends in class and no reason to leave it during recess, they'd end up drawing, playing a handheld or whatever it is kids might be doing nowadays, I have never heard of this one ending with ""and then I ended up popular and was invited to lots of parties!""

New hypothesis: being in the class AND talking to others in the class is a strictly better way to make friends."

1,"I've had two best friends in elementary school, we all agreed that we will definetly remain friends and hang out all the time, and now, a few years later, we rarely talk. I have 3 new really good friends from high school now, who i am even more connected with, and we obviously had the whole ""we'll still be best friends for sure"" talks, but the closer i am to finishing high school, the more scared and sad i am to lose my daily interactions with them all and maybe never see them again."
1,Kurzgesagt knows a bit too much about my soul
0,Why the personal attack?
1,Not trying to sound entitled but I think (only a suggestion) that it would flow a little better if you made it a Discord group instead of redit. For some reason Reddit is being supper glitchy and cant even type. Also things are less clucky on discord.   But then again you must have your reasons so im not one to say anything but kindly  suggest.  Keep up the great work!
1,It says a lot about me that this came up on my for you page.
1,"I feel like I’m great at making close acquaintances. I care and I share, but whenever there’s an opening to move it towards friendship I run. At this point in my life it’s become a habit I’m struggling to break"
1,im concerned about criminal connections and have made those complaints known to the FCC. They do not yet feel like doing their jobs yet.
1,"People are made to believe that people need friends but people should know that they only need themselves. A lot of people stay happy being alone, may be happier than being around so much drama . Most people are extremely toxic"
1,im 19 i feel like shit i do nothing with my life i have no drive to do anything i have no friends bad connection with my family no one to talk to. I always run from myself and have so much anxiety over the smallest things cant do anything im a piece of shit wonder how im still alive
1,"This video hit at just the right time, I made the mistake of taking a gap year, during which I accidentally isolated myself, leaving me with few/weak connections. Starting University, I realize that I haven’t made a completely new friend without the assistance of mutual friends since early 9th grade, and I know absolutely no one there. Knowing I don’t have good social skills made me nervous to initiate conversation and after the first week and a half it was feeling hopeless. Luckily I was recently approached and made a couple of acquaintances who seem to really like me so far, and I have some stuff to keep in mind for developing those new relationships."
1,"This leitmotif man... It actually made me tear up. Makes sense, because these self help videos have genuinely, genuinely helped me in my darkest times. It made me feel that there's hope again. 

Thanks for your hard work, Team Kurzgesagt heart_suit"
1,Thank you so much for making this video! I needed this
1,"At the time of typing this I have no friends... I gave up the old ""friends"" because they treated me kind of awfully every sense they knew I was ""different"". I am trying to make more friends but I didn't know how. Thank you so much for making this and making it acessable."
1,"I'm very ashamed because I'm lonely and it would be very difficult for me to open up to a girl because I'm like that. I'm afraid that I'll be judged, but at the same time I'm the type of teenager who is handsome and can have all the girls"
1,"Me to myself, before moving to another country in summer 2019: make friends with people at your master's program. Socialize as much as you can. It's scary, but you got this.

The pandemic: ""Oh, honey. Sweetie, darling, BABY!"""
1,"At this point I think I should just accept the fact that I don't have any friends. Its been a real struggle these past years, trying to find friends to fill that empty void, but ultimately it was all fruitless.
Its automatic for me to be alone, its where I feel happiest. Even though I get those hard moments of loneliness, I think its fine. It feels like so much effort to work on getting friends, with so little chance of getting actual results. So, why bother? Jesus filled that empty void I mentioned earlier anyways. God and my parents will be my close friends and I'm completely fine with that. 

Thanks for your supportive videos on this topic, I think they really offer great and practical advice, though it appears that nothing has really helped my situation. Best of luck to everyone else going on this journey."
1,What a load of rubbish.
1,This is beautiful :)
1,Nah yall are horrible people. I'll stick to my gamer friends.
1,"i im just here because i just wanna experience hanging out with ""friends"""
2,So basically you need to make friends in order to make friends
1,"I spent a long time trying to become friends with people in college, and all of the friends I made dropped me once the pandemic hit. People don't value friendship very much anymore."
1,"I really loved the art at  with the cloud in the shape of a duck, and would be so delighted if it was a poster I could hang in my room x"
1,yesterday i was asking a close friend to give some tips to maintain friendships. Kurzgesagt: (☉｡☉)!
2,Thanks for calling me out ): XD

0,Damn this shit complicated
1,"Bruh, even YouTube titles are roasting me now"
1,"Actually I have some questions... Just by my experiences I guess... But i really like this video It is really a useful video for me as a college student but.... What if you feel from that other person to whom you want to be friends with that they are not interested about you, not as curious as you are about them. What if you feel as if they don't need you because they already have someone??? I really have these types of questions where I feel lonely or any video on friendship!! Sorry for this msg I don't know if i am the only one to think that but that's just what I experienced grinning_face_with_sweat 

Thank you red_heart the video is well told !! Great work"

1,"I refuse to talk to people who can't correctly answer ""If you didn't have breakfast yesterday how would you feel?"". Same to those without a internal monologue. Gnostics were right about hylics."
1,"I have had trouble communicating with people since the Covid 19 pandemic started, when it's got new normal I'm totally quiet when school is open, I see to myself that I common quiet than before the pandemic I hate myself every time I waste my time being alone but even though I'm like an extremely introvert person, my mother is always there for me to talk with. Now I would make this video as my motivation to practice again to be a social person."
0,How the hell did you guys I needed this? Definitely Got my ass on google Adsense or smth
1,I still have friends and people I know but I rarely ever contact them. I stopped messaging first to see if anyone would hit me up first and it's been radio silence and now I feel so isolated...
1,This is very frustrating. I'm at a point in my life where I have no one to contact with. I live in a small ass town that's opposite of my ideals. The nearest town with a big population is 30 mins away but funds are low and I can't afford just to go out without a good cause. I dont know how to cope anymore. Jealousy & loneliness will have its consequences on me and others. But I got some handy tips from this video. Hopefully one day I will have a legit path and not go down a dark and lonley road.

1,The fact that YouTube recommended this to me instantly says a lot
1,I just cannot believe weather you like chilli or not distinguishes you between extravert or introvert.
1,"just be confident with ourselves, dont need any ""friends"" who pretend to care"
1,"This reminds me of my host. The being that I inhabit is most interesting, but confusing. They show both introverted and extroverted mindsets. They seem to value friendship but prefer being alone.

It's immensely confusing, but over the years of my inhabitation of them. I've come to understand what and what does not work for them. They seem to enjoy gaming and creating friends, and really cares for those that are online. But a bit too much if you inquire me about it.

But with people in person, they're unnecessarily cautious and sometimes even hostile. They don't seem to trust anyone other than their parents in person. This of course has been a slight issue, he stays as far away as he can from other people in rooms. They seem to show no interest in people in person, but this seems to be changing. More years of study is required to make a conclusion though.

I've also found out that music seems to make them more passive in the presence of others. Should they be listening to music and an individual walks up to them, they will seem to listen. But this friendship tends to not last more than a week, even with them giving attention to it. I have been attempting to correct this for quite some time now, but it is unclear if I am getting anywhere with it. Further data and study is required."
2,The easiest way to have friends is to go out and do something.
1,Dont care about stupid meat around me except i cant stand it. What makes u happy is good country. As a result u get good education and job
1,"I just want to say as a self proclaimed extravert that I love you introverts. Idk if any other sociable people think so, but I find your inner world so beautiful and inspiring. Not everyone needs to speak their mind (imagine how chaotic the world would be haha) But I’ve always been happy to adopt the slightly strange and wacky introverts of the world! Keep being yourself, and as cringy as that advice is, trust me, you’ll find someone who’ll eventually listen :)"
1,Loneliness=shorter life? I only see upsides.
1,"Too late, i'm 24,  lonely and no longer have where to meet ppl"
1,NOBODY has time TIME for anyone anymore everyone wants to apparently grind and apparently show their friends how cool they are. But in this process they will only loose connections.
1,"What about when you’ve grown so accustomed to being alone that you don’t even feel like seeking friendship anymore, even though you may acknowledge that it could be beneficial? I think a lot of people fall in that zone, where making bonds with others becomes more demanding than any short-term gains. Or perhaps it just becomes harder to connect as you form a more isolated and disconnected identity, which has fewer and fewer commonalities with other people’s interests. What if you’ve become so vested in your interests that meeting others seems entirely pointless? You don’t feel miserable about your aloneness, but are aware that it might be detrimental. How do you muster the energy to get out there without any clear motivation to do so?"
1,dust off those Astartes
1,"OK, but that animation of a TikTok dance at  astonished_faceastonished_face amazing!!!!"
1,"No. Wrong. Do not make friends! They are just that people who will stab you from the back. Always end like that. There is no solution for this. You born alone and die alone. May you think, between these two is life... But no. Nowadays you can call like hell."
2,I Want to make Friends For fun and get English level
1,That was my idea! I was gonna get famous and make a “get the hermits outside” movement!
2,Great video.Apprecite it what you doing.
1,"All my friends left me because of my seizure condition, so making friends isn’t the issue, it’s keeping them and teaching them what to do on the rare chance I do have a Seizure."
1,"I built my life around one friend and that has always been sufficient. My wife and I have been friends since we were 16. We did everything together and neither of us needed a whole lot of friends because our happiness came from each other. At 24, she passed away. Its been a little over a year now and because I never needed anyone else back then, I find that I have little to no friends around today. Unfortunately, this past year is when I could use a friend or two the most. Now that I am an adult with a job that is rather individualistic and little life outside of work, friend-making opportunities are very hard to come by."
1,"I am lonely but i don't need friends either as I am highly introvert .
But only things that bother me around is weird behaviour of people around me who thinks I don't know socialising ."
1,"So, in a nutshell, society has become so idiotic that Kurzgesagt has to come and make a motivational animations in a vein effort to improve the situation at least a bit."
1,"I have put in as much energy as I coud to retain friends from school  but al most times it was like pulling on a loose rope  it never pulled back 
Nobody called me nobody seemed to want me around except one  and he lives 40 km apart from me  in a hard to reach spot 
Sure I have famely and i spend as much time as i want whit them in I like it but it's not the same 

Lost a great deal of friends when I left scouting when ter was noting for me to do 

I dont drink alcohol  and that is not helpful either 
 I have adhd and it wont sting for a few hours it will literally sting for a week go away and come back a for a week  the activity I spend most time on in my head it thinking how things coud have been and what I did wrong I have learned how not to go mad from this but it left me cold and lonely  tere is a girl I never was in a relationship whit that is just bouncing around I'm my head evry 3 to 4 days  for the past 10 years or so  I have reached out many times let's go to a protest togeter  happy birthday  
Shall we meet in a park somwere 

And ter was always somting  I want to move on but tere is nobody to replace her"
1,"i have about 6 close friends.   i always felt that's all i need.  i feel pressured with this video lol.  wondering if there's a video about ""why bother making new close friends"".  also worth mentioning that my significant other is the bestest friend i ever had and ever will have and he tends to be my whole world."
1,Life's too short to be judgmental and backstabbing ... Be your own best friend first and have compassion for others you'll get there sparkling_heartyin_yangfolded_hands
2,So what if You genuinely like isolating yourself while acknowledges that it can weaken friendships and still feel fine about it?
1,"remember, friendship is magic, dont let the magic fade away"
1,I've got one friend and I'm happy
1,Social media and the internet getting so integrated into life has been only terrible for our world
1,"I was quite ""popular"" (ie had many many friends, was partying all time) before quarantines. Now I only have 2 friends remaining, this video was more than needed, it will be a tool to come back to a normal life in which I feel good :) thanks Kurzgesagt"
1,That nice. But however it still not worked me and still be lonely

1,"I just want to be a kid again. When I was a kid I didn't have many friends, but I had a few. Now I have none, they all grew up and moved on, while I just wanted to stay young forever and have everything stay the same."
2,Introverts dream video is out.
1,"To anyone watching this,

let's be friends."
1,"im 35, no wife or lover, work online and have 0 offline friends.
This video made me even sadder"
1,this might be the most uplifting video kurzgesagt have made
1,"Imo;
Friendship will happen! 

You can't make it!"
1,"I've just felt empty for a while. Like an inner part of me died.
Nothing that I normally enjoy makes me happy again.
In this day and age, if you need anything (be it help, electricity or general stuff) you have to pay a lot of money.
I haven't been able to sleep for several years, haven't had a good dream for ages, nothing good has happened to me for three years.
One of the basic principles in life is trust, and I'm having trouble finding it.
As such, I'm also a person who tends not to make friends because I'm paranoid about turning my back on someone and vice versa.
I'm very jealous of people who have found their place in life because nobody gives me the opportunity (I've been an IT clerk by training since 2020; I'm currently studying to become a web developer. I still haven't worked for any company and I'm 26 years old.)
If I make any mistake, I'll be judged forever, I feel terrible.
Every person has an interesting personality except ME. I'm the most boring guy ever.
Companies naturally like people who have colorful humor, incredible wisdom or good looks - and I'm afraid I won't achieve the three things to be worthy of being part of any team.
I haven't found anyone who understands me, nor can I talk to my parents about it because they've never felt so desperate.
In fact, a human can always say ""no"" to you, that's the word that can lead to pain and wars.
I've now found that trust is very easy to break or break, no matter how many years it's taken to earn it, that's how friends become enemies.
And if relationships eventually disappear, why try to build them up first?"
1,"I have not had any social contact in 2 years now, and I have never felt more content and satisfied.

I hate socialising but always felt talked into it by society: Only a socialising person is a good/ fulfilled person.

BS.

I am happy to not have to deal with people. My IQ is probably about 130, my friends were usually inadequate in that regard, and people in general tend to be vindictive, slow and stubborn.

I may be not neuronal normative in most ways. But really, 99,99% of people are super idiotic. Look at the state of the planet if you need a reference.

People with IQs above 140 and a solid education tend to entertain me. But they are rarer than an FRB..."
1,"Im 14 and I don't have any friends
in the past when I was younger I've had friends but they never lasted for more than a year"
1,"i hate averages. u dont die younger bc u have less friends, ppl are killing themselves which is skewing the result. and the ""average"" teenager spends more time on tiktok than parties because forty percent of the world are introverts who would obviouisly prefer being inside rather than partying or calling on the phone (sidenote who calls on the phone other than your dad and your boss?) plus isnt tiktok a form of socializing too, its literally called social media"
1,"Reading this comment section and watching this video is really quite comforting. I recently moved quite far away from home for university and I've been feeling a bit lonely. It seems like everyone has already found their cliches and I've been left out, but seeing and reading everyone else's experiences have let me know that as long as I put in the effort and give myself time, I am sure I will find people I can connect with.

Cheers."

1,"I think the greatest effect of the pandemics on my social life is the destruction of the “second ring”. First ring friends are my best friends, people I’ve known for years and spend time online and irl with regularly. These people I kept in touch with over lockdowns online gaming, zoom calls, messaging, watching movies together. But the second ring friends “that guy at your gym” “the girl you run into at flat parties” “the couple you go rock climbing with” those are all gone.

1,"I was doing a part time job and one coworker of mine even though 20 years older than me, was a huge gamer nerd and when we touched a topic like Yu-gi-oh, we decided that during breaktime we would take a look between eachothers decks. What also happened on the park, was that another few (still quite older than me and I thought I was already old) just showed up and were all like : 
""Are those Yu-gi-oh! cards? Wow, I haven't seen them in ages!""
My point about this is that you should show your activity on a public ground even if alone, there's big possibilty that you would attract attention to certain people."

1,"This is about my fifth comment. 
Let’s just remember, being bullied is apart of life. 
If your not being bullied of any kind I wouldn’t reconmend clicking read more.




If your reading this you are being bullied, Not being felt in.
Always remember friends don’t stick together. How close you are, the best thing they can have are reunions. As an Muslim 
I’ve seen that friends who kick eachother all the times and call it fun go down in life and go to the lowest schools. 
Before reading further this was my personal experience.
I exceed in my studies and still trying to stop hanging out with people who would kick their friends.
I don’t know if my close friend is still one of my friends, I asked him after he got pushed to hit me alot of times in an alley with 8 people cheering him if we are good. And he responded with maybe yes maybe not, I want to disconnect my connections with him but I’m trying to finish my studies and I’m not letting someone interrupt that, if you are looking for new friends it always worked for me to play a sport, 2 teams I played for I never heard of any of their names. For sports you can’t really be angry at eachother as your disappointing the rest of your teammates and being risked of being demoted to a lower club."

1,"I'm literally a gamer who plays games ie shared experience with other gamers all the time and yet almost nobody becomes a friend. People simply aren't connecting, everything is about a quick dopamine spike and see you later. Relationships are actual work and nobody puts much work in just for friendships sake. I've got one good friend and that's it, everyone else has drifted away. Would be so cool to have a few more especially gamers that create content."
1,red_heart
1,but how can i prioritise others if i cant prioritise myself? making new friends and staying in contact is so difficult for me and thats why many break apart or i do not even have the full commitment to put effort in it because it exhausts me
1,"Damn, this was posted at the right time in my life"
2,"I once wanted friends, now i want my own death"
1,Kurzgesagt definitely needs to publish a self-help book
1,"As an introvert I am well aware of my social meter and cannot engage in activities or conversations with another person for a decent amount of time. I do have friends but I do not engage with them regularly and I turn down any invitation to go out almost all the time. I do have overwhelming sense of things and also that weird thing where senses get tangled like hearing light and seeing sounds. My friends do understand how I am and what I am comfortable with but people who demand active engagement drift away from my circle sooner or later. So I think the right people for you will stay, just being open to new connections is enough in my opinion."

2,"Your videos are so helpful, practical, clear, and hopeful. Thank you. <3"
1,i swear kurzgesagt just knows whats going on in my life and makes a video how to fix my problems
1,"Thank you for this. As someone who deals with severe social anxiety and is a chronic introvert by nature, it's very difficult for me to form close friendships, never mind long term ones. I have a small group of friends, but none I've known for more than a few years. Old friends tend to drift away, and while I'll try to stay connected, eventually they just are just too busy with their lives, and that introvert nature and social anxiety makes me feel as if I am a burden. So, I move on as well, make some new friends for a while, and then move on again. Over fifty years, this has just been how things work. I'm never really lonely, but I do spend a lot of time alone.

It's a weird existence I've fallen into, but I do want to say I'm doing okay. Some days are better than others, and I enjoy my friends company a great deal, but I'm oddly okay with being alone for long stretches of time. Probably something wrong in my brain, but I'm old now, and learned to be fine with things."

2,"Thanks for the video it was amazing but in my case it happens every time that if I make a good friendship with someone then they will replace me with some other friends after some time, it just breaks my heart every time and I lose faith in making more friends loudly_crying_facecrying_face"
1,"I used to have friends, then had some terrible experiences where I felt completely betrayed. Since that I can't seem to open up, or be vulnerable which impedes new meaningful interpersonal connections.

1,"What advice would you have for someone with ASD who struggles to sustain sufficient prioritisation to friendships and relationships? I know it is common for people to see an individual with high functioning ASD as just indifferent or uncaring. It is difficult because we can go months or even a year/s without contact and pick up where we left off without much preamble, I understand this is not the case for the majority?"

1,"Heavy on the social networks built around a core member. Since I could remember all my friends have had a larger friend group that I was not apart of. Even when it was going well, I always felt second place or disconnected, as it wasn’t just a friendship I wanted, but an interconnected community. A community that I could reliable invite to game nights or ft with or invite to a birthday party. That’s what I truly desire now - a community that prioritizes friendship between all parties."

2,"haha, this is targeted at the edutainment fanbase lol"
1,"I wish the phrase “social distancing” had never been used, in regard to the Coronavirus Pandemic. It was such bad messaging from the outset—and was unfortunately used by health professionals, media, and those in government. We were asked to be apart a physical distance for mitigation of the virus, not a social distance. We are social creatures and are connected socially to one another, and this repeated use of “sd” only made people feel lonely and isolated during a time when we needed to remain socially connected, not distanced. We are really “socially distanced” now and set apart from each other because of so many reasons, which left us unable and unwilling to work together collectively as a nation to fight COVID—19."
2,Finally with this knowledge i will make 100 friends
1,"To quote CGP grey: “if you want the bird of happiness to land on your ship, don’t spend your time trying to catch but build it a better birdhouse”

1,I was lonely for a decade. Dont ask why. Is complicated. Now i have friends and a girlfriend. Happened in just few weeks. How? I just went to park to play chess with old people. Because is relaxing. They dont ask you questions. Just enjoying nature and chess. Next to us - table tenis for younger people. They noticed me that i was younger than those that i play chess with. Then they invited me but i refused. Took me couple weeks and i joined them. Girl there liked me a lot and invited me to ride a bicycle with her which was my second best hobby...i liked her a lot as well.

1,"This made me a little bit tearful, but I appreciated it. Even though it's ""frustratingly simple"" as you put it (and some of the advice you will have heard elsewhere already, I'm sure), apparently we need some reminder every now and then because, again as you put it, it doesn't mean it's easy at all.

The fact that loneliness is getting more widespread is heartbreaking to be fair. Just because more and more people are experiencing the same feeling that I personally experience, doesn't mean it gets any less painful.

Thanks for the video. I hope we all can reverse this trend someday."

1,"you dont know how many times i search up how 2 make friends

i struggle so much making plans and hanging out with people. i always make excuses because i have no motivation to leave the house or hang out. also,  my friend group doesnt share any same interests with me that i can find. theyre always either too distant, too loud and talkative, or too unpredictable and wacky. unfortunately the closest friend i have is very unique, expressive and i dont know how to describe their personality but im kinda scared to go out with them out of fear of embarrassment which i feel really guilty about. i know i shouldnt let my glass ego get the better of a friendship and ill make it a life mission to hang out with them out of school

1,"What about those of us who have put so much time and energy trying to make friends over years, only to never be reciprocated, where what connections you do form are only ever tenuous at best, to the point where our souls shrivel up and die and now we cannot make ourselves do any more because life has taught us as a matter of fact that all that energy was wasted?

The simple act of ""reaching out"" does nothing when no one around you actually wants friendship anymore."

1,"Companies share some responsibility for this.

People will argue against that, and that's fine. Encouraged even. But listen. They know what they're doing. They know the affects their products and services have on people, though they'll often try to only present data in ways that make them look positive because it's in their interest to do so. But internally, they are aware of the harm they're doing.

Our corporations ought to be held to a moral obligation to provide products and services in a way that is beneficial to consumers and society, while minimizing potential harm. Right now they don't. Their ONLY concern is maximizing profits. And they will seek to reduce social and individual harm ONLY as far as it is profitable to do so. This is one of the failures of a purely capitalistic system, and we've got to come together and address it."

1,"this issue of time is mainly a symptom of our modern work based society- which demands our full involvement and respect at all times or else one must face death by ostracisation

while the advice given here is good on its own, the ultimate solution to chronic loneliness isnt just to have everyone start perusing friendships more often- its to reform our workaholic crunch-admiring ways and rethink our relationship to all forms of labour. ie, make it so work isn't mandatory for survival as it is now so people can actually afford to focus on friendships."

1,"The big thing that happened was people taking stuff for granted they would forget their old friends and make new ones just to do the same neglect them and wonder why they are gone. You cannot make and maintain friends if you put 0 effort into it. If they are making all the plans and events etc and you are always somehow ""unavalible' you cant complain that you have no friends. Friends like any relationship requires you to do your part, if you are forever abscent the other party will move on without you. Ive seen too many people do this, where they would always have ""no time"" to hangout or see friends, which is bullshit if you value your relationships you can always find atlest 10mins out of a day to say hello via text or have a 5 min phone convo if not cut a half an hour aside to have a quick lunch together. Doesnt have to be everyday but atlest try to make that weekly. People value you as much as you value them, if they see you consider them not worth your time, they will do likewise"

1,"folded_handsred_heart A frenemy is not thoughtful. It will always be about themselves. I once had a frenemy who never once said, ""Oh come, lemme see where you are staying.. How's the acting going? I watched all of your shows. I watched 'Ugly Betty'; hoping that I'll see you in a scene. I'm so proud of you"". None of that.

folded_handsred_heart When somebody comes with snarck comment or they say or do one or two things that is uncalled for, know that that's a frenemy. They're keeping tabs on your life, ""When did you buy that? How are you able to afford this?"" Frenemies are in competition with you. They're not rooting for you, saying ""You go girl! Do your thing. I'm supporting you. I'll be right here."" ..  They're in competition with you. I just moved out of the way and let her fly past and crash. Let your frenemies go before they drag you into their negativity and they distract you from being friends with bossbabes that love you; you love them; you love each other's families; you evolve; you grow together; she's the wind in your back; she's the sun ahead of you. And she really means the best for you. You have to get rid of a lot of people in your life. They're distractions that will distract you from your destiny, your ultimate goal.  Throw them out. Don't respond to their accusations. They're not worthy of your golden time.  

folded_handsred_heart You build your brands; your careers, (your husband, your children). Be happy. Evolve to be this positive wonderful person. Don't let negativity in your life. I have seen it a couple of times. It happened to me. There are no regrets; only experiences.  -Fumi Desalu Vold"

I always had to go to them and be the one to organize meetings, but then when I stopped putting in so much unreciprocated effort, it turned out that I don't really have any friends at all. I'm pretty sure the only person who actually enjoys my presence is my mom."
1,Dude the timingof this video
1,I cant believe i am watching this video at a  AM Friday night after a night out and I am actually taking some notes about it....

1,"I'm only watching this because its a Kurzgesagt video, not because I'm lonely...
Yeah"
1,"
This fact really sucks for one big reason: it spreads.
I've found myself in friendships asking to do things with them every now and then, and every time worrying that I'm bothering them somehow because they never reach out to me. So I feel like I'm being annoying by reaching out to them. This leads to me reaching out less. As I said - it spreads."
1,"Wow, this channel is amazing. I am learning English but found this video's information very interesting. I have no friends and have always been alone maybe it's time to find real connections. Life is short and it might be worth it to meet people before I die."
2,Loved the sousaphone
2,"Just show up.









This mantra did me good more times than I can count and it sums up the best advice in the video as well"
1,Noone never wanna spend time with me
2,Dang friends lol so cool i wish they were real
1,"My only gripe with this viceo was the incessant repetition of real life meeting. I have both friends that i keep up with face to face but friends i keep up with online as well. both require time, while face to face friendships are stronger and take more effort, i wouldn't say my online friends are anyless worthy of their title."
2,"thanks for this. its really helpful. I hope i get my first friend soon. and theyll be real, not imaginary"
2,"i enjoy being alone and nevr wanted a friend , living in your mind is more fun fore me. books are the only friends i need plus having no friends give you freedom"
1,Even if you have close friends things get so difficult once they get married and close to impossible once they have children.

1,"As someone who didn’t make friends until well after becoming an adult, I’ve learned adults make making friends so much harder than it needs to be. People seem uncomfortable with my kid-like approach of directly talking to them and inviting them out rather than playing the delicate social dance. My whole life I’ve felt like a robot learning how to be human. It took me until my mid-30s to learn how to develop relationships outside my family and romantic partner. Pretty much everything in this video I had to research like an anthropologist. Now that it comes more naturally to me, I feel less drained in social situations to the point that I now describe myself as an ambivert instead of an introvert."

2,"We all need this, thanks kurzgesagt."
2,I feel like this is targeted
1,"why would you encourage people to meet in person. We are just out of the 7 wave that is still the single most deadly infectious disease. Actually covid killed more people this sumer than malaria, the flu, aids and car accidents combined. If everyone would have stay 100% isolated for 2 month we would had erradicate this virus and we would had been able to go back at making friends. The good thing is now, when you go out and make friends, you are participating in thining the number of people o  the planet. If we manage to kill half of the world population, we'll be on track to reduce co2 emissions. So let's make friends and kill all the elderly, the sick, the imunodefficient kids in the process. That's just natural selection after all."
1,Sometimes I get resentful. Like I feel I'm always the one reaching out and others aren't putting in effort. But closing yourself off out of petty spite isn't a good idea either. As I've gotten older and my interests have become more introverted and it's become harder to find reasons to connect with people. I mostly just stick to my hobbies and talk to people in group chats but rarely ever see them. Part of that is also due to proximity like moving away from your hometown. I spent most of ky 20s working crappy jobs and spending time in school that went nowhere. I was mentally exhausted all the time and I feel like I lost touch with people. Now that I'm in my 30s I feel more disconnected than ever and at times I feel I lack the social skills to fix or create new relationships. It all just feeds into an anxiety depression loop. I think we sometimes feel we always need a reason to contact someone and reconnect but we rarely do. Just do it.

1,"Loneliness seems like a small issue, but eats you up inside until there is nothing left. We humans are social creatures, yet in this day and age it seems harder and harder to connect to people. Thank you Kurzgesagt for making this video"
1,People are vastly overrated :/ Even among the people I know I usually just tend to not talk to them. If that means i'll die sooner i'm fine with that. I rather die sooner but happier than live longer and have to deal with others all the time. Only person I can stand is my girlfriend & some of my family members.

1,"Hey if you are lonely now, just keep in mind that half of the world has been through the same thing during covid. 

For me it's just getting better slowly, step by step and it started like this: 

During the second (?) wave of covid, my neighbour invited me over to play board games with her and my best friend, because we all went to the same class in high school and the two of them were good friends. We met once a week and it was a huge help to get out of isolation and depression. 

I really cannot be any more thankful to them because I guess I was not even close to being my normal self and they still tolerated me and gave me something to look forward to each week.

If you can, please check on the people you know might be lonely and maybe invite them over or do something simple like this to them. It can mean so so much."

But it's not, and it's miserable, and I hate it so much... I want to connect, to feel that sense of belonging and worth. The easy path is eating me alive inside but it's so damn hard for me to beat this."

1,"You forgot to mention that this is a video for normal people who happen to feel lonely. Not people who are defined by solitude and were rejected since the first time they set their foot outside.

Those people will need to forfeit their very nature and the idea they have of themselves. And good luck trying to overcome the most primordial instinct of self preservation.

I will be here. As always."
1,This is amazing
1,damn so gonna call me out like that?
1,I saw a Zelda reference:)
1,Wish this was posted just a few months earlier but luckily now I've sorted my life out and regularly head out with friends. If anyone's out there in the same situation I was in where you have no friends and making friends scares you my advise is to just talk to people and try to organise things with groups of people not just one on one as you then can pick out who you really want to become friends with and you can expand your friendships with new groups.
0,"Damn bro, you really calling me out like that. Smh"
1,"hmm i stopped talkin to buddy's before the pandemic an covid was like an excuse for me too. 
dont regret it as i was a shitee friend an when i do get a text i say to myself why do they bother talking to me.

1,"Hey Kurzgesagt! I followed your links and found a local meetup that happened Sunday. When the time came around, I wasn't sure if I had the introvert social battery to spend meeting new people. I thought I would reach out to an old friend who I had regrettably let slowly drift from my life. I decided if he didn't respond, I would go to the kurzgesagt meetup. Turns out he was super happy to hear from me, and we spent Sunday evening at a bar having a good time catching up after 6 years :) Thank you for giving me the push!"

1,"This creator knows me too well. Just when I felt lonely, and had no one, it popped up."
1,"Loved this video. An indirect lesson to this is ""work-life balance"" is important. Capitalism pushes us to define ourselves by our career, to live to work, to chase hustle culture, but that leads to us neglecting our emotional needs. If what you need is to work, then do it, but never do so with the expectation that it'll solve all your problems. Find a comfortable threshold and stop climbing. Pursue friendships, hobbies, and maybe, just maybe social progress in activism for safety nets and better work regulation against toxic corporate culture and classism."
1,"nice try, but huge fail...... normally love kurzgesagt videos, but this video is no no way helpful, this video is just a reminder of the lack of options i have. 

none of the info is applicable to me or my situation, ..... not in school, there is no work for me, my hobbies and other interests dont have clubs, or other meet ups, at least not where i live, or just are not group activities....... the standards of bars, or clubs, are not for me either..... ive reached out to people, they all got excuses...... every piece of information this video offers is old news, and useless to me..... i was excited, hoping for some new ideas............... oh well thats life, disappointment."

1,"As somebody who’s had little to no friends throughout my entire life, it’s very difficult making new friends cause I’ve generally just never had actual practice. I have a very small friend group currently, but I only see them once a week thanks to D&D. It makes it especially difficult that I can’t drive due to being epileptic, so making new friends is especially difficult if I have to ask them to pick me up to go out. I know my D&D friends hang out with each other on multiple other occasions, but I usually don’t get an invite because I know none of them want to drive 30 minutes to pick me up, then have to drop me off back at home.

I’m also pretty introverted, while they’re all extroverted. I’ve been told that after an hour of being at a party or gathering, I tend to start shutting down, which makes people not want to hang out with me. I don’t even realize it. It just happens. I guess some people are just meant to be alone."
0,"If you don't have friends, maybe, you don't need friends. Maybe you really just forgot why you hate friends and are starting to feel like you need them again. Because how can you not have something you crave. Don't argue with yourself please.

I have a friend, that I was great friends with, who I fear got sucked into her romantic relationship.  I am happy for her, just sad that she doesn't literally doesn't respond to me except a text maybe once every three months.  I saw it coming too, so it's very upsetting to keep reaching out and not get anything back, especially when I know she has time to scroll through twitter and such."
1,HA! Bold of you to assume I still want to make friends. I'm simply far too deep into my antisocial life and atrophying nonexistent social skills for that to even happen by accident... nor do I even want to make any friends in all honesty. Interesting video anyways

1,"how about ""how to get a Girlfriend"" for the next video?"
1,"My story:

I don't like doing this, but videos like this lead me to sometimes make comments explaining my own personal stories. Basically I vent a bit.
I assume this happens _because_ I have no one in my life to open up to. I bottle everything up, and I feel an opportunity to share when I get a chance like this.
So go ahead and skip this comment now.
I promise you it is not that interesting and it's so long that it'd probably just be annoying to read.

Background info: I am 20 years old. I graduated College earlier this year in May. I graduated High School in 2020, during the beginning of the pandemic.

Originally there were like 8 paragraphs here explaining my entire history of friendship in junior high and high school, including the 2 specific friendships I actually had. But that's not really important. All you need to know is that I never really made any friends during that period, and a lot of it is due to my own failure to understand certain things. I had really high standards (I still do) and I could never find someone I genuinely enjoyed being around. I was well-liked at school and everyone thought I was funny. I had loads of acquaintances but I never made them into friends. The one true friendship I did have was eventually ruined by school ending and never seeing her. As well as me trying to cling onto it and talking to her way more than I should've. I hope I didn't leave anything important out, but moving on...

So nearing the 2nd semester of my Senior Year, it somehow just clicked with me that I could make friends with people.
All these acquaintances I have could be my friend. I just had to get my head out of the sand and stop looking for someone to be there for me. Not all friends have to fill that massive, painful void in my soul. Some friends can be just for fun. I basically ignored that in the past because the people I _did_ have fun with were the people I got easily drained around, and felt angry around. But I was starting to realize that a lot of people in my classes were genuinely fun to talk to and be around. I would look forward to classes where I could talk to them. I honestly believe true friendships were forming. And they would've formed.
But then... COVID.

yeah, one day I went to school. Had fun. Went home. And never returned. I never got to say goodbye to anyone I knew. They just disappeared from my life altogether. Those friendships that could've formed? Basically impossible now. Everyone was moving away to college, or getting married, or whatever. So I was alone again.
I was one of the lucky people to go to a college that had some in-person classes. But I was in a CTE program with very few students, and lots of pandemic restrictions. By the time we were actually talking in class, it was my final semester, and there were only 2 other people in the class. 2 people that I didn't really like that much. So I never made friends in college. In fact, I never really interacted with anyone in college at all. My last chance to form friendships in a school setting was shattered.
Not only was I unable to even say goodbye to people in High School, but I never met anyone in college.

And now we have the present day.
I'm a failure. I've went a half a year just sitting around at home with no job. Not even looking for a job because I don't want to go through the process. I just want to work. I don't want to apply or anything, I just want someone to tell me what to do, and then pay me for that.
I'm more apathetic than I've ever been.
The only social interaction I get now is with my church's youth group. And there's only 2 people in the group that I genuinely enjoy being around. The rest annoy me to no end. Every time I hang out with them, it's with the entire group. As an introvert, this drains me so much.  It's getting harder and harder to put up with everyone else just for the very tiny chance that I'll have fun with one of the 2 people I like (if they even show up to the meet-up). Not to mention, I'm secretly atheist. So even if a friendship did somehow blossom out of this, it's not gonna last forever, because at some point I'm gonna snap and leave the church.
I've got to the point where I just stop going to Youth things because I'm so tired of hoping to have fun and then not having fun.
I'm not a pessimist, I'm an optimist who keeps getting burned. I can't keep doing this.

Me being friendless affects me more and more every single day. It gets harder and harder to focus on things because I just have nothing to look forward to. I have nothing I enjoy outside of video games. There are no people I can talk to. There are no people I can have fun with. There are no people for advice, or to encourage me. And it's honestly ruining my life. I want a job, but I have no desire to get one. And I'm pretty sure it's due to the apathy that stems from never having fun in life. I _need_ meaningful social interaction, but it doesn't exist.

in summary:
-I'm a failure without a job. I'm increasingly apathetic and have been for several years.
-I have 0 friends, with my only social interactions driving me mad

Wish I had a positive note to end on, but I don't. I just fall deeper and deeper into apathy with no way out. My life has no substance and I'm just drifting, hoping one day I'll find real friends."
2,Friends are the people you eat last.
2,Y’all know me too well loudly_crying_face
1,"The reason I don't have friends because all the kids at my school have autism, are the different gender of me, not into the same stuff as me, or act weird towards me, I used to have a friend but he was my opposite gender and also was a dream stan

Edit: im not being mean to autistic  people, I met someone at my school who had it and did the weirdest shiz (like have ""very kid friendly"" images and videos on his phone that I was shown.)"
1,"As someone with aspergers, this opened up a lot of curiosity while answering many questions over I've asked myself for years. I always wanted friends in school but was too awkward and too desperate. I tried telling people my secrets hoping that would make them open up and be okay with their imperfections but it never worked. I became an adult, went to work, and lost my girlfriend due to not knowing how to keep her happy despite my best efforts, and it wasn't until after all that when I stopped having high expectations and stopped behaving desperately when I finally got a few friends at work. They aren't the best friends but I'm not always either. We don't look at each other as bffs but again we don't have any expectations we just talk and occasionally go on walks or play games. I'm fine with it although I would like one good and close friend. There's always improvement to be made and things to learn but it gets better so don't give up everyone."
1,Easy: get a girl/boyfriend and let them introduce you to other people. Hope this helps! <3
1,"I think you over generalised extroverts. There definitely are those you referred to, but you also get those who love being around people, but in calmer settings. I think it depends on what part of human interaction you prefer"

Thanks to ""intellectualts"" like you. Are you going to be sorry? No, you are always sure in yourself even if it destroys normal life. :("
1,Bro even the hot singles in my area don't want to hang out with meeee
1,This is a thirteen minute shit-post
1,Why does this vid exist
1,"I've mostly given up on trying... every time I tried to make a close friend, they'd eventually move too far away to keep in touch. I've struggled with relative poverty since I was a child and could never overcome the financial hurdles to be around the people I like. I don't feel comfortable where I'm at, and everything is hundreds of miles away. I've never had a job with people I enjoyed being around.
I'm chronically lonely, and I've accepted that will be the way things are now. I'm just waiting to die now."

1,I had terrible diseases and couldn't go outside :(
1,I’m crying so hard watching this as I’ve been so lonely for too long… maybe even my whole life. It hurts when it seems like everyone around me has people to hang with and be social meanwhile I’ve got no one except me and sometimes my parents who are generally busy. Kinda feel ashamed writing this as a 30 yo. I’ve been to therapy and nothing helps.

1,"This video made me cry. Thanks to years of depression and anxiety, I pushed away a lot of people and locked down my Facebook account, thus preventing most people from reaching out. 

Once I made a post saying that I was going offline for awhile, and that to call or text me if they’d like. No one did. That really hurt. 

Over the last 1 1/2 years I’ve felt better mentally, physically than I ever have but… I’m still lonely as hell. I know a lot of people meet friends at the gym, but I’m the type that  if I had a friend with me at the gym, I’d get nothing done. So I keep to myself. 

I work from home, permanently, as long as I have this job. Ever since February of this year I feel my social anxiety has only gotten worse. I had suggested to get together once a month or so, that was brushed off. 

I was invited to a cook out (not work related) and I shut down the invitation. 

I feel like as I push 40, as someone who has no children, and very little close family, it’s only going to get harder to make friends.

It’s really not that easy I feel for those of us that have had a rough go at making, and even keeping friends."

1,"You posted Loneliness last time I felt lonely af...

Now you posted another one..."
1,hmmm i think youtube is tryna tell me something by recomending this video to me
1,"I basically lost all my friends because A: I am always too anxious to make the first move to hang out, and B: I am physically separated from all of them due to everyone moving away or pursuing college while I stayed in my home town. I haven't genuinely hung out with a friend in 3 years, and I'm incredibly lonely, with really only myself to blame. It's been rough living with this anxiety, and in addition to having depression and gender dysphoria- it's hard for me to even leave the house at times. I really just hope I can be calm and happy enough to ""re-enter"" the world, and truly try to connect with lost friends again."
1,I have no friends because i made the choice not to after the last one i had stole money out of my sons piggy bank.never will have a friend again .  Im an introvert so the fact anyone was my friend is crazy enough .
1,"Making new friends really does require effort. My mother is getting on, and constantly complaining about being lonely and is extremely overbearing on her adult children. Yet she absolutely refuses to listen to any advice at all or take any suggestions. She's essentially digging her own grave while whinging about it. So don't be my mum!"
1,Homies it works! The science works!
2,I feel like the simplest way for me to go from an acquaintance to a friend is treating them as if  they are already my friend
1,I always tell my wife that we live in a world not built in a way that is conducive for adults to make friends in most situations. Thanks for acknowledging that in a way; while still saying there's hope if you work at it.

2," Yay, the Phantom Sword ^^"
1,"A female friend and I got in a meaningless spat about three years back and it caused a divide - we chose to go our separate ways for about two years after but it occasionally ate away at me because we were pretty good friends up until then. I decided to reach out, forgive, and make amends. I couldn't be happier that I did - as we are now closer than ever and hang out often. We decided we would never revert back to our old situation and decided to work on ourselves together, flaws and all. 

Before I go on a ramble, I was saying all this just to point out that reaching out and forgiving to seemingly lost friendships is always worth it. At best, you become friends again - perhaps even better than before. At worst, you were still genuinely honest and apologized like a decent human being."

0,why did this get recommended to me wtf youtube
1,I think the biggest problem for me is being emotionally and socially available at times. I struggle to maintain relationships because it takes so much out of me and i’m not sure why. I feel so lonely because of this. I feel isolated by my own doing. I’m not sure how to shake it.
1,it helps if you have free time instead of working all your waking hours to pay for your base needs
1,That's a wonderful video. Congrats for this awesome job!!
1,"I think some need to realize that so many people are actually feeling the same way. I myself an a bit of a introvert, so introductions sometimes are hard, and when I'm too nervous I really jumble my words, but I have lately just been making myself get involved more, Just making myself talk to that person no matter what. It has made drastic positive improvements on my life."

2,Wow this hit home.
1,"This video can be finished with one sentence ""touch grass"""
1,It's scary coincidental that just recently I had to cut ties with all my old friends from university/college of 7 years. It's rough. But I had my reasons. I was wondering if it was worth making new friends. Now I get reminded it's essential to feeling happy and alive. Thanks for the video.
2,"Kurzgesagt might be saving many lives with this, no joke"
1,too long video (yawn)
1,"I feel like this video has too many views. I'm lucky enough to have friends from elementary and middle school, but I haven't really made any permanent friends since then so I know how hard it is."
1,"I have friends, and I do stuff all the time with them but I still feel lonely, covid hit as I was starting secondary school and scene as I obeyed the lockdown strictly I didn't see many people and developed depression during that summer and it won't go away, the only people who make me happy aren't able to make me as happy as the day before and I had a dream last night where I was happy and had a girlfriend (it wasn't one of those dreams) and i woke up and it crushed me."

2,Group of friends are toxic to your mind sometimes. It's better to have only 1 friend who will listen to you everyday.

2,Subscribers are my friends red_heartred_heartred_heart
1,"The way you've put complex social situations into simple, yet overly symbolic images is pure poetry. This is the best YouTube channel by far today. 
I'm a loner by nature, I was extremely popular in my teens, twenties and even thirties but then I discovered and experienced the joys of being alone and never looked back. I'm weird I suppose. ;)"
1,"Making friends when you don't really have easy access to your hobbies is ridiculously hard. I spent my late teens/early twenties in New York,  Paris, and LA. I love foreign movies, high end fashion, going to the opera, going to art museums, Michelin starred restaurants, basically all things that really only exist in cities. I moved back home in rural New England for a bit, and ended up meeting my now husband. We travel a TON, mostly so I can do the things I love that don't exist in small towns/suburbia, which is great. 

On the other hand, I haven't really made a single new friend in the last ten years. I hate small talk. I couldn't care less about blockbuster movies. I don't really want to talk about TV. (For me TV is for when you're too tired to watch a real movie, read a book, read The New Yorker, etc.) I love to cook, but like, my dad was a trained chef, and I'm an excellent cook as well. I don't care what someone made in their InstantPot or crock pot. When I lived in cities it was easy for me to make friends. I'd meet people at museums, at parties, at fashion shows, etc. etc. etc. Now I find it absolutely impossible. Even when I've reached out to people, I've just been disgusted. we'll  have people over for dinner, and no one reciprocates because they're afraid of looking bad. (Pro tip: Serving someone frozen lasagna and some half decent wine looks a lot better than never returning invitations.) At this point I've pretty well given up on making new friends."
1,"America has been destroying friendships for a long time; from making everything require cars, to social media, to Hollywood forcing toxic romance above friendship, from politics telling us is us vs them, to jobs requiring people to commute two hours from different cities.

America more than ever needs architects to design communities; not Mark Zuckerbergs designing AdBooks."

1,"Let the animator know that I really appreciate them for the ""Lemon"" guitar amps. guitar"
1,The quickest I have ever seen people make friends is at this summer camp I guide at where you go on a two week canoe trip. Kids are constantly interacting with each other and relying on each other to keep the trip moving. Within those two weeks I’ve seen friendships form that will become lifelong.
1,"ngl, friendship and social interaction is the main reason I went from a 1200/wk job to an 800/wk job. I was good at my job so now I've gone to a more speciallised roll with fewer people, but I still get to touch bases with everyone a couple times a week, which as much as I don't like to admit it, suits me well."
1,one of the problem is i never get invited to b-day partys or never get a call i only get call is my parents+no body ever wanted to talk with me
1,"Several studies have shown that if you're neurodivergent, people will make their mind up about you in as little as thirty seconds. They won't know why they dislike you, but they won't stick around to find out. You'll be almost universally shut out. Social rejection is painful and devastating.

Something else  that infuriates me, is that people don't have the energy / time or want to cultivate friendships outside of an incredibly small and close-knit circle. You can put in all the time you want to keep those friendships alive, but one sided effort like that is wasted effort and will result in pain from hurt feelings."
1,"I am starting a new small business... I left all my friends in the dark because there is so much work to be done... I signed up to go to a plant convention, so I hope to make a connection while learning about the art and science of plants! :)
This video came out at a perfect time"
1,"What if I never had real practice? The most I ever had was close acquintances, never a friend and now I only have people I meet at work, they all are closer to each other by the time we worked together, but not me though. I'm just more familiar, not closer. i do not have their number, know their surname(mostly), adress or even much about them. I have no idea how a new person can come to work and within a week or two act like long friends with people I knew for years and be closer to them just like that."

1,"""I don't need friends, they disappoint me"" - Shaw, Carla  (proceed to pose)"
1,"Being forced into the same place with people can just as easily be a prison sentence. It mainly works at elementary school level, when freedom and economic differences aren't as apparent, individuals aren't as spoiled with the power differences, tribalisms haven't settled and you all have the same interests and you are all new there. (and sadists/psychos are still too young)
Whereas civilized behavior is based on a social contract and basic decency(non-harm), paying people for their time without enforcements. It gets in the way of childish friendships, but it also prevents toxic exploitative interactions with control-freak/enslavement purpose or just out of sadism."
1,"I’ve increasingly gotten better at socialising. I had practically no friends when I started secondary school in 2018. I did get into a group but it stayed mostly in school until lockdown which unlike most people was a blessing for my friendships. I was forced to socialise with my group on more than just school. This year has been a massive jump. I joined another social circle earlier this year which I’ve stuck with and I’ve just started making my way into another one this month which is the first one where nobody in it goes to or used to go to my school. It really takes time and effort it’s like bodybuilding. You need to consistently interact socially go outside your comfort zone and push your social skills to its limit it won’t happen quickly but it will improve. Don’t be afraid to talk to people most that you meet are nice. Don’t feel like you’re unworthy too and if you embarrass yourself in front of others  it will hurt for a bit then it will be forgotten, if it’s not then for me it usually becomes a fond memory that I joke about with people who still remember. I feel like messing up in a social interaction is like failing a rep when doing a set and less like injuring yourself."
1,Social media is the main cause. The only true form of social anything should be in person.
2,Are friends some animals?
1,"So what you're saying is that faking you're interested in what they're interested with is a good thing?
You know that's also a problem right? Faking things just to fit in with everybody will just gonna deplete you mentally."
1,I know he felt a lil awkward saying “vibe”  face_with_tears_of_joy
1,"While all of the given advice is solid, I wish it wasn't as centered on the idea of physical proximity being the only way to make friends. Makes it seem like any long-distance friendships are not nearly as valid as irl ones and that you should only seek out people in your area (which probably wasn't the intention of the video, but still).
It is true that online friendships are harder to maintain, for some people it may be hard to connect without constant physical interaction and seeing each others' faces. It is also easier to lie and mess with people over the internet, which may lead to ingenuine heartbreaking relationships. But in other cases, for many people being in online communities is just as good of an option as irl meetups, if not the only possible one. I personally have a lot of acquaintances and a couple close friends online that  I can rely on and spend quality time with. Some of them might live on another side of the world, which is certainly a bit disheartening, but it doesn't invalidate our relationships whatsoever since they still give me almost everything that irl friendships could. I met my romantic partner online as well (we met in an MMO in our early teens) and... 10 years later, most of which were ldr, we're still together in a vibrant and loving relationship. Because the most important thing in connecting with people, imo, is open, frequent communication and having things in common. That's all. 

Anyway, the most important point I'm trying to make is that... don't think that you *have* to meet people irl to form connections. It's not a necessary element. People can be shy, introverted, have social disorders. They may not be able to leave home and be around people. They may not have any places nearby to meet likeminded people and can't afford to travel far from their area. Don't be discouraged from making friends if you're not in a position to meet people physically - internet exists!"
1,"I really appreciate what this video is trying to do. It's a great message that will help a lot of people. But if I'm honest it just made me more sad. I feel like I've been putting in so much effort to rebuild my disaster of a social life, especially since lockdown, and I still feel unsatisfied with it.

When you are already doing all the things this suggests, and yet still you feel like you are always the one putting in the effort, and like you couldn't scrape together enough close friends for a modest party, what are you supposed to do? The only conclusion that I end up drawing is that I'm just not the kind of person that people are interested in being friends with. And that constant negative thought is a tough one to bear.

I'm trying to balance this all with a full time job, creative pursuits, and a new relationship, and the constant mental exhaustion is just burning me out."
1,Did you just assume everyone on youtube is lonely? Thanks for the negative affirmation. A quick solution to not being lonely is letting go of your addiction for despair.

2,"why was this recommended to me





WHY WAS THIS RECOMMENDED TO ME"
0,"I just talked to a random girl today. I wanted to meet new people but I was scared of rejection.

It didn't go great and she wasn't that interested but to be honest it really was worth the rejection. 

Dont be scared to talk to new people. Just force yourself and you'll meet someone cool eventually"
1,"I’m generally pretty good at maintaining my relationships with people. It’s a task I work hard at every day. It’s tiring. 

I’m planning on living in my car and travelling around my country next year. I figured that I’ll force myself to disconnect from all of my relationships at home and allow myself to make new ones on the road… but I know I’m going to be so lonely, and I’m kinda scared of that. 

Oh well, it’s supposed to be a trip of self reflection and discovery anyways, as corny as that all sounds."
1,"I’m in middle school and I feel like I struggle to make friends. This video was very beneficial to me, and helped me realize that I don’t put enough effort into going out because I’m a home-body. I used to be very social, but I put too much effort into friendships and ended up getting hurt multiple times. I think that’s why I have some reservations. But today Ik going to try and go to a football game with someone."

1,"Well, it sounds simple to do crossed_fingers_light_skin_tone"
2,I have/had good friends and one best friend (which I used to thought as best friend) but recently I have started to notice a pattern about how it is never about my problems or my life and always about him/them. It was toxic I have decided to gradually distance myself.
1,"my pain is constant and consuming me, i feel like i can hardly find people i can relate to or understand me"
1,"Thought so many times of ending myself, the thought I had so many friends before and now I'm absolutely lonely is literally killing me, I can't remember the last time I laughed truly."
1,"Tbh I never had any issues making friends, I didn't have many but enough to be satisfied. Now that I'm done with school and can only go to uni next year I'm starting to feel very lonely, partially because I feel like I don't enjoy my friends anymore. I want to meet new people but don't really know how at the moment."
1,"I recently joined a Pokemon go club in my area. I'm not very social and I have really bad social anxiety so it ended up being super ideal -- everyone is busy playing and nobody chats much, we all just enjoy that a bunch of nerds are catching pokemon together and it gets me out of the house"
1,I can’t watch this yet because I have to work but know I was here
2,"I feel like this only works for a certain type of people... And that's okay, I wish them the best of luck in finding friendship."
1,"for me it's just.. dealing with people in general is troublesome, at least. not that i'm flaunting ""oh im unique"" or something, but i found adjusting myself to most people as a hassle. not to mention, topics that interest me often times feels alien for other people. my cultural taste is too different; for example, i like video games, but most people around me only play games casually or they just play those free to play mobile games, not AAA games. so most of the times, the ""friends"" that i have are almost only online friends that lives like half world apart from me, even those ""friends"" are only chatting friends at most, not really a ""friend"" that i can really open up to, and since they live in another country and culture, there're also a lot of things i can't talk with them."

1,"For how much I love the internet, I think it's also human's greatest doom regarding social places. We've got so used at keeping contact with people and follow our hobbies from home, that we allowed real social places to close down. The pandemic just gave the final kick to the last ones standing, but the process already started long ago.
The only kind of place that proliferates is restaurants, like there's no motivation anymore to go anywhere in the city, unless you want to eat out, it's pretty depressing."

1,I have football.
1,"bruh, I can't even make friends on the internet"
1,"Great video to put things in perspective. It's a common misnomer that people always end up making friends 'naturally' along their way. Creating and building lasting friendships is a task that requires effort, investment and certain nuanced skills on occasion.

Something I love to talk about in the context of a discussion like this is Schopenhauer's hedgehog's dilemma and how brilliantly the analogy reflects the paradoxical human condition of loneliness."
1,Finally the video I need!

You released video about habits and changing them when I was struggling in bringing harmful (lazy) daily routine to a stop and now you're releasing this in exact period I'm feeling down for being seemingly lonely. Everything is on point, previous one really slowly but seems to have an effect I just hope I'll be strong enough to actually implement these advice as well. Compared to this every coaching I've encountered sounds like total BS. This feels as close to a ""nutshell version"" of actual therapy as it gets.

Never could I say before about any content creator/company that their work had a meaningful, especially positive impact on my life.* Really thank you for that, Kurzgesagt. I'd probably already joined bird army if not for stereotypical student financial situation.

* - CGP Grey's video ""Rules for rulers"" might be there, despite saying kinda obvious things it really changed how I understand politics."

1,Smile at someone like you've known them for ten years and perhaps in a decade you will have.
1,"Not much time for friends or hanging out when you're an adult, everyone is just too busy. It took 3 months to get one lunch date with a friend because both of us kept having things come up or schedule conflicts... After a certain point people just stop inviting you."
1,I've made it pretty clear I want no part in society
1,"I really needed something like this, I never got the chance to make new friends and when I try to go for it I just get scared and feel really stupid by this point i'm at the lowest point of my life ngl and little things like talking to new people or meeting up with friends make me feel better, I should really pull my self together and try this little advice... Thanks kurzgesagt <3"
1,Even he knows i'm alone....

1,"I've tried so many options to connect with people, and still have no friends. If I die one day, no one will notice.
It's like doesn't work for me, so I decided to accept that loneliness. This is also a problem though."

1,"I hate when I'm approaching someone who is alone and I try to talk to him about anything to try his luck and gradually become a friend but then another guy comes and talks to him and in an instant (not little by little) it's done friend of him or her without any effort, on top of that neither of them talks to me anymore so I lost my opportunity to finally make a friend. I don't know what happens, how, because instantly, and all the time they talk to each other. but it takes me so long to make just one friend. sometimes i feel a little sad :("
1,Algorithm really tracking me down
2,I swear to God this channel is a psyop
1,Spicy food and extroverts? Is that actually true? It seems strange
1,"Genuinely wholesome, thank you Kurzgesagt."
1,You have to be careful who you befriend because there are bad people in this world. You have to befriend good and trustworthy people. And if you're a bad person you can befriend bad people. I am careful who I will befriend. I don't want to ruin my life for people who use me and who are false friends
2,"Sending out an invitation here! Now, who wants a friend?"
1,Man i will make so many close friends in my college
1,"I mean... it's quite rare to find intelligent, creative and interesting people nowadays."
1,For me study has been the main reason why I don’t see my friends anymore but I’ve chosen it so I deserve that grinning_face_with_sweat
1,Kurzgesagt trying to call me out Tuesday morning???
1,so you can see here that when society is build to separate us like the nuclear family a staple of capitalism that we become alienated form one another and incentivized not to interact with each other forming friendships and unions NOT WORKING/ NOT NEEDING TO WORK = MORE TIME FOR WHAT YOU WANT TO DO LIKE HAVING FRIENDS. spending most of our days working when machines could be working for the masses means we trade our most precious commodity TIME for an hour of pay. if someone could take an hour of my life and add it to theirs how much would you charge them? why do we settle for so little for something so extremely valuable.
1,Only weak attention getting people need friends.
1,There's so many ads on this video. It makes it nearly unmatchable despite me being interested. I've seen five ads when watching this.
1,This has to be one of the most beautiful videos I've seen from this channel so far. The fact that this topic hits hard on the current state of our society (and of course myself) could be the reason; but the animation was incredible. I Immediately hit replay so I can appreciate it even further. You guys keep OUR life enjoyable and fun. Thank you!
1,Never have I been so personally attacked by a YT video title
1,"I have pretty big attachment issues and I’m pretty sensitive to some things. The only way I’ve lost friends is bc we moved on to different schools, but other than that, I don’t think I can handle losing a friend the hard way :/"
1,I take offense at the spicy food supposition! I'm extremely introverted and i make food so spicy that everyone crys (and also my own hot sauce)
1,"Kuzgesagt's definition of going to school: ""Society locks you in a building for several years."""

1,thank you kurzgesagt your tips might not work tho yknow?
1,This video was beautiful.. Hats off to you and your team!
1,find a friend station concept would be crazy though fr fr
1,"""Dust off your space marines or find a D&D group"" face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy I feel like theres some broad strokes being painted in that comment"
1,"If 10 million people watch this video, which is fairly reasonable for Kurzgesagt, and 1 in 10 of them are motivated to either seek out a new friendship or revitalize on old one, then Kurzgesagt will have created/saved 1 million friendships. Way to go guys!!"
2,"A piece of feedback, to me the title was kind of pretentious. This kind of put me off watching the video even though the video itself was great!"
0,I don't have any friends. true story.
2,Nice your video good.
1,"I'm 17 i don't have friends an my classmates who I thought as my friends are just using me for their essentials like for notes, answers for exams, videos and pictures but nothing more just ignorance and feel like i'm invisible... once our class held a party and we begun to dance and i went on the dance floor too hence i have no friends i felt nervous and uncomfortable no one gave me a space or invite me to join them, i was being pushed side to side... when i try to talk they be like '' can't here, speak loud, later, hmm'' it feels like i'm bothering them no one wants to talk with me except my mom. they have their own groups, chats, hangouts, parties, trips and many more... All of my tries were time wasting at the very end i left alone with myself"
0,"Wow, I fucking hate my life"
2,I really liked the 40K shoutout xD
1,I feel like i don’t deserve friends cus i think i won’t be comfortable enough to talk to them enough or spend time enough. So they will think i don’t care and they will disconnect.
1,"absolute rubbish of a video
made me actually unsubscribe"
2,This is such a sweet video
1,This came on my reccommended
1,"There is such a weird psychological block to reaching out to people who you feel guilty for not contacting sooner. You want to reach out, call them up, see how they are doing, and you know that in all likelihood they will be delighted to hear from you, but all YOU can think about is how GUILTY you feel for not doing it sooner, and you learn to associate that feeling of guilt with how long it’s been since you reached out, so neither person ends up contacting the other for fear it will be awkward since it’s been so long."
1,"social media and this living on the internet is ruining our mental health! and everyone lives on social media and not the real world, WICH is also a part of the plan, when you are scared and anxious you are easier to control, and that is the plan our future is slaves for the elites who maybe will give ud money or food, or maybe not if we do not do what they say, look around it is happening allready"
2,i just lost so many friends because imoved to a different city this video is so important and usefull to me!
1,"**Thank you Kurtzgesagt for changing the thumbnail and title.**
With the video being so popular, it was just haunting you from the recommandations on every page being ""YOU HAVE NO FRIEEEEENDS"" ghost
Not very effective into making this world a better place."

1,"I'd rather personally be alone , than with people that make me feel lonely . I know its a simple thing to say , but only now , when i don't really value anyone but my relatives that much , i actually started feeling alive ! I don't feel like i - don't fit in , lonely or weird at all . I just feel free , free to make decisions , free to live my life without needing to fit in with anyone ! So to anyone who is depressed they don't have friend , don't worry ! If you fight your anxiety then the time will come , you will find your friend . I'd say its even better you dont have one know , since whne you will meet someone shit will be real XD ."
1,"Life really trying to call me out, getting severe depression from loneliness n stuff a few days ago, and now a video teaching me how to make friends. I'm sorry universe that I've not had someone I call a friend since 2017, and before that was 2004."
2,I love that they made the main characters have personalities
1,Average insecure Kurzgesagt viewer was not ready when they saw the title
1,How to make new friends: Ask strangers about their pronouns. Nothing works as well as pretending you don't know if there is a man or a woman in front of you. Nobody will be offended by this...
1,Sharing personal stories in a balanced way and not to overdoing it. Because you shouldn't open yourself too much infront of others.This is a great advice. Thanks to the channel.
1,"Cute video to tell me I'm gonna die alone lmao. There's nobody around me, my country wants me dead for who I was born as, and I haven't been able to casually or through paid services find anyone online whose vibe fits with my own xD"

2,I love this channel. The way they genuinely care about people makes me have faith in humanity once again.
1,This video feels oddly targeted like damn I know I'm a lonely fuck but don't rub it in YouTube.
1,"All the lonely people...
Where do they all come from?"
1,"I recently moved from south Florida to Auburn, upstate NY.  Moving during the pandemic had its challenges.  But the hardest challenge I was not expecting was the difficulty in meeting people.  Its been two years and I don't have anyone I'd call a friend.  I have coworkers and neighbors sure.  My coworkers are loud and outspoken a out their personal  beliefs (especially if you don't ask) and they aren't the type of people I enjoy to be around.  Other than work there's local bars to hang out at. But I don't like going out alone to bars I never last more than two drinks before I convince myself to just go home.  It's real tough to find thise connections.  I joined a yoga class and got a gym membership.  Here's to trying."
0,I hate targeted Youtube recommendations.
2,“Friends” are such a 90’s thing.
1," this NEVER happens, at least after the teenage"
1,"One of my fav quotes from “The Social Animal” feels relevant here:

Trust is habitual reciprocity that becomes coated by emotion; it grows when two people begin volleys of communication and cooperation and slowly learn they can rely upon each other. Members soon learn that they can not only cooperate with each other, but sacrifice for each other."
1,"me wondering why 
Kurzgesagt is starting to talk about my struggles"
2,"i'm just yelling at nothing.
how do i have friends."
1,I’ve found my generally quiet demeanor in addition to my chronic short term memory deficits have been the one-two punch keeping me from forming lasting friendships
1,"What is the name of the flower motif-ing the video? If it’s real, I want to grow one."
1,"i really needed this, thank you kurzgesagt <3"
2,"Thanks, Kurzgesagt! This is one of the best channels on Youtube!"
1,"I live in a desolate area, the handful of people I know don’t contact me. When I contact them or ask in person if they want to hang out they always say no, then the next day they talk about how much fun they had the night before with each other. I’m very positive I’m not annoying to them, we have great conversations at work and laugh together. It’s been 4 years of this. I feel like nobody wants me. What would y’all do?"
1,The way i have none if this opportunity to make new friends irl smiling_face. I have been struggling with this a lot and thought its my fault and my family told this to me too . I cant take this anymore.
1,I just thought it was memes

1,"I recently reconnected with a friend from middle school and it was exactly like this. We were both nervous but have a lot in common and are open to forming connections. Things aren't as seamless as they were when we were 12, but we are on similar journeys in life and will (hopefully but I don't doubt it) remain lifelong friends."
1,But what if your in a toxic friendship but your really connected to one person cuz that’s happening to me right now I just don’t know what to do I have a lot of friends but they are my closest friends and I just blocked both of them because I don’t feel good when I’m with them I really just feel sad but it’s probably the right thing to do so I’ll try to get more comfortable with this decision
1,"There are many examples that I could identify with and agree with.

Unfortunately, for some people, popularity or beauty are criteria to have.
And more globally, I know that the biggest obstacle I have faced and still face is money.
With little money, there are fewer activities possible, less chance to take the initiative to organise events.
So you have to make do with what you can afford and compromise and give up."
1,Turning strangers into friends is the best thing. They are meant to cross our paths for a reason it is not an accident.
1,Why has their latest videos all about things that can kill you and depressing scenarios. Please go back to the fun science/ space stuff.
1,how about a chapter explaining why and how ADHD brains work the way they do? your talents can come a long way in helping neurotypicals understand their ADHD friends better.

1,"I am colleague student in Stuttgart, Germany. 21 and pretty online person, but feel free to hmu if you wanna do things :) Pretty lonely myself"
2,"Great stuff team, thanks so much for putting out things like this as well"
1,"This comment is lost in the cancer, but I'm gonna say it anyway - this vid was overly simplified, and would need a world more depth over simplified again to be of genuine use."
1,"Ah yes, exactly what I need"
1,I am sorry but this vedio is kinda just not good with the details of characters if you compare it with your other vedio.
1,"if you suffer from loneliness go watch another video.
At home.
Alone.
then sleep.
then work."
1,friends are for people who can't afford sycophants
1,"Remember that the Lord Jesus Christ died on a cross for you because He loves you so much. He then rose up from the dead three days later.
The Ten Commandments are called the moral law, (most of us are lying thieving blasphemous adulterer at heart and deserve hell) you and I broke the law, Jesus paid the fine. That’s what happened on that cross. 
By accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and savior and not just confessing your sin, but also repenting of all sin you have done and putting all your trust in Him in prayer, He will grant you everlasting life as a free gift."
1,"""If you want a friend, be a friend"" has never been more important and accurate than now. 

It is really that simple. People just don't want to make the required effort. It is easier to sit at home and feel sorry for yourself than it is to help your neighbor who you know is having trouble with (insert difficult or easy task). 

People know the solution to loneliness, but they lack the motivation to do what is required to make or be a friend."
1,The Jurassic Duck poster and Lemon (Orange in real life) amp and cabinet was a nice touch
1,I dont agree fully but it's nice thumbs_up.
2,So who wants to be my friend ? Any one up for friendship ?
1,"I have 0 close friends. my last one killed himself a few years back. All I do is work and game. After I hurt myself in my 20s my ""friends"" at the time stole my truck and from my house. Realized then friends are all fake and only want to use you for money or validation"
1,"The absolute state of western civilization when people have to get educated on how to make friends. Not sure when this decay started. As a 40 year old Swedish introvert i had no problems making friends anyway.  But now I see people struggle everywhere, not only on internet. It's like a entire generation got catastrophic lack of social competence. Is it mayhaps the generation who grew up with social media in their socially formative years?"
2,I do have friends but ehhh why not get even more lol
1,"Its sad that we gotto make such videos. Loneliness is a issue most people in germany have. But to be honest its hard to establish contact in a society driven by material possession or physical appearance.

Wish you all much success finding more friends."
1,It would have been handy 2 years ago.
1,"It’s just… I know that I want to make more friends, but when it comes down to it I simply don’t know what to do if I’m in a social situation, so I just stand there awkwardly. I’m definitely not the type of person to just come up to someone and start talking to them"
1,"Alrighty then, let's make friends right here
Anyone wanna join? :p"
0,stop giving me things to do all i want is to
1,"@ Oh man that really hit deep.

As an extrovert, I feel the fact that I was bullied throughout the majority of my school life and having emotional withdrawn parents means I often fall into the trap of a strong need to make friends and I come across as oversharing and needy person, as I want to feel validated and seen by other others.

A few months back I had a person in my life message to say ""he didn't have time in his life for a new friend"", I appreciated the honestly, but it just reaffirmed my self belief that I'm not something worth being friends with and it's not worth living."

2,Hmm alright anyone want to be friends? Let's do this!
2,It's like this was made for me
1,"I was lonely for literally years... until I discovered a local D&D club. It was essential in helping me come out of my shell and find friends. Unfortunately, it shut down, but we managed to keep most of the community together and find new locations. I DM 2 games a week now. I never would have expected I would be someone who helped keep other people together, when less than a year ago I couldn't even reach out to others. I can't recommend the game enough. It really salvaged my life."

1,Bruh that's personal
1,I WILL NOT TOUCH GRASS STFU
1,I got enough friends … the one I know that’s it smiling_face_with_sunglasses
0,I actually want less friends and want to disconnect from society. People are fucking idiots.
2,"No friends for the past many many years,  what a lovely life, I'm loving it! 
Go where I want too, do what I want, don't  answer to anybody, what more can I a guy ask for ? I live my my life the way I want too."
1,Very helpful. Handy seeing as though my school starts tomorrow and my grade doubled in size
1,I never expected this YouTube channel to change the world globe_showing_Americas
2,"Friends? What the hell are friends? Everyone I ever had either screwed me over or stole from me! I've had enough ""friends"" now I LOVE being ALONE!!"

1,"As an adult, I learned that a good way to meet new friends is through things like book and gardening clubs, community choirs and bands, extra work functions, community events, etc."
1,"I live in a rural area where 95% of my peers are interested in either football, cars/bikes/farming equipment and drinking alcohol. People here aren't dumb or uneducated but extremely narrow minded, their entire world takes place within 3 villages down the road in every direction and unless your family has lived in the same village for at least 3 generations or you like and do all the things they like and do, you have no chance of being accepted at all."

1,"Yeah, your friends the ones who you let too close will wound up deceiving you. I see must of you didn't learn nothing from Jesus downfall. Being lonely can be your best friend. Less people less problems!"
1,"Gotta admit. I liked the ""what happens when you stand too close to a nuclear explosion"", or ""What is Rabies and why is it not as fun as it sounds?"" kind of videos. This one is just kind of depressing."
1,What about when your not in school anymore
1,This video make me feel warm on the inside
2,And also most of my friends are fake except for like one or two

1,"Kurzgesagt: to make friends, spend time in real life instead of on your screen.
Me: * watching Kurzgesagt on my screen *"
1,Does this apply to introverts? I'd rather watch a movie by myself than with others.
1,"A lot of people want idealistic friendships nowadays that seem beneficial from the very start, people need patience too :)"
1,"I moved and switched high schools half way through high school for the 2019-2020 year, so I was there for half a year, then they Online for the rest of high school. so I’ve gotten used to being isolated, and being Lonely almost feels normal because it’s been like that for 3 years now."
2,"Great, but i dont have any money to make friends"
1,"friends are overrated, the last time and the only time they are needed to borrow money, and that foot will refuse"
1,"A few good ones are enough. Few years ago I have a lot of friends, a lot of people I hang out with then as I grow older and mature I realized that the people I hang out with weren't real or somewhat fake, they were only there for the fun but in times of needs only a few ones came to help. It is more dangerous to have more friends that a few ones."
1,"As a recent college grad, I can say first-hand that the pandemic royally screwed things up. I had transferred to a new school in the Spring of 2020 (right before everything shut down), so I had a whopping 2 months on campus. Since then, all classes were online and I only returned to campus for the final semester before graduating Spring 2022. My social circle was non-existent and I feel ridiculously lonely now because of that. :/"
1,Potatoes are taking over the world
1,"When I was in high school, I had a lot of friends and we even got to travel together. But then, everybody moved away for college, and then COVID happened and I moved away, and I'm slowly refiguring out how to rebuild my past connections, as well as making and sustaining new ones. Even though my social circle is a lot smaller, I'm very lucky to have a few friends who care about me, and we actively try to schedule time to get together. This video is really nice!"
1,"what i noticed that worked for myself is   that if I force myself to be in situations i don't want to be in (work events, partys, places where i meet people i dont know) i tend to atleast somewhat connect to people, i tend to find people with similar interests. what also really helps is that if you already have atleast 1 friend try to connect with their friends aswell."
1,I want to have fun with people but I’m so self-conscious all the time. I get scared that that makes me seem boring so I share details from my life and my work to make me seem more interesting but then that just makes me come off as a show-off. For context I do quantum computing research and also teach self defense
1,"It's not only energy. It's also time and money needed. And many people can't prioritize social life over ""not dying tomorrow"""
2,"Lol for some reason I have always been central point when it come down to friends I have plenty good friends and there are plenty more who wish to become my friends but honestly , I love my old friends and already maintaining friendship with them it's pretty energy intense. Cheers to all real friends , God bless my friends love you all guys"
2,The easiest way to make friends is by doing business. Mutual interest in money will boost that hidden social skill. So basically money make friends beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,I just want someone to talk to yo irl
1,"The biggest mistake of my life was losing contact with my high school pals. I've graduated in 2015 and the last time I saw them was in 2016. Haven't really had a friend since.

Now next year I'm going to work in Japan, and considering I cannot speak Japanese, I'll be even more isolated without even my family."
1,"Hi Kurzgesagt - some folks I know who might benefit from this advice do also find the background-music too distracting. I know it's a tall ask (and a pity that, unlike subtitles, YouTube doesn't yet have a feature to switch this off). Would you consider doing a version of this video without the music?"
1,I can firmly say being in a class but silent all the time does not make people sympathetic to you. It makes you a target. Trust me I know from experience.
1,"I've felt lonely all my life. When I was very young I used to have a good amount of friends, but even then I never felt part of a group, I was always the outside man that got excluded from everything that could have been hidden from me.
After I became 12 I moved from my old city and I thought I could meet new people here, and all 3 years of middle school that I had left I spent alone, literally never had one friend, every day was so boring but I didn't know and still don't know how to make friends. After 2 years of high school, here I am at  ~17 yo with only 2 people I can call friends, still feeling more and more lonely.
And after watching this video I can say that it DID NOT help me at all, just told me the same things I've heard before when I looked for tips on how to make friends, but that doesn't help me at all, I'm way too shy to even talk to most people my age, one reason being cuz I have no social experience so I just don't know what to say and am too scared to run out of things to say in a conversation. I have no idea if I can be saved anymore, might be forever stuck with no friends which makes me more and more depressed each day. I just don't know what to do."
1,"Find it hard to trust people for friendship, from Primary school to high school they all pretended to be my friend to use things i had, all of them even admitted it and told me not to contact them i didn't really like you, from then on with my dad dying of a brain tumour and depression and anxiety i never developed socially I'm practically mute and cut off emotionally from everyone, i dont have any friends in my mid 30s, i am just becoming a friend to myself and hardly desire being with anyone now"

It took a lot of therapy and hard work to get to where I’m today, it took me time to understand that my problems are solvable and suicide is not the answer.
My birthday is coming up next week and yes, maybe I won’t have anyone to celebrate my birthday with me this year again, but I’m taking small steps towards a bigger goal and actually making efforts to make a connection with people so next year I’m sure I’ll have at least one person to celebrate my birthday with."
1,"Ok, so who's being friends w me so both of us can stop being lonely? We both watched this video so we have something in common already"
2,"Idc about friends never had, it was never my interest cause I don’t like anyone"
1,Can’t wait for the xqc reaction on this one pepehands
1, Oh my God that's literally all I do I have almost perfect attendance and I rarely ever speak unless spoken to
1,MF IM TRYING
2,"""Recommended"""
1,"I mean i want friends but I know there's a lot of fked up people in the world and there's no way to tell them and therefore I prefer to be alone than having a chance to get fked up friends
And by mean fked up, it could be closet psychopathy, delusional, egoistic, narcissists, manipulative, pedophiles or many others."
1,"When you are 35+ and moved to another city, you can't make new friends, only fellows and sport team members"
0,Is this a personal attack?
1,"You don't need friends, but you need to know what makes you happy and to be happy with yourself."
1,this video convinced me to message an old friend after completely isolating myself for 3 years and we met up today. it was like nothing had changed between us. needless to say this video probably changed the course of my life
1,"OMG i moved 1,5 year ago to NL, still feeling really new - i'm so happy and greatfull for Your idea :) <3"
2,"AI friends count, RIGHT?"
2,"Damn, what a notification to wake up to lmfao"
1,Grasce needed this.
1,Good video just wish it had more advice for people who can't go out to meet people and have most interaction online
1,I feel called out as an introvert who likes Sade.
1,bro this vid is made for me
2,Friends should be quality over quantity. You can have a lot of acquaintances but real friends are hard to come by.
1,The animations and the topic of the video made my heart melt. Pretty wholesome that you occasionally make videos of this type.
1,Kurzgesagt really giving us life advice these days. Very cool
1,Kurzgesagt how do you always upload videos on the perfect moments?
1,"This video came at an amazing time.
I've been struggling with loneliness, despite being so surrounded by people I knew and am friends with.
I'm sociable, I can interact; but, when I need someone to spend time with, or someone to go to, I don't really have anyone.
It's such a hard feeling to explain, especially to people who've never had it. I've had people tell me to just, 'try harder' to make friends, or make myself a better person and then people will befriend me; despite me trying those already.
It's difficult, and watching people around me in groups makes me feel envy.  Joining another friend group (especially those who are close) are difficult.
I want people who will be there, people I can see who want me and go out of their way to spend time with me. 
Overall, I just want a sense of belonging.
And even though I've worked on myself for so long; I'm just tired of being lonely.
Tryin my best"
2,Brilliant video! Would be happy to see more on that topic. Thank you yellow_heart
1,"Hey, Im introverted and LOVE very spicy food, OK? Geez..."
1,"I recommend making sure you stay away from politics as a topic, it can be important to you, but it is a massively easy way to end a possible or ongoing friendship.   There are so many other things to talk about than what someone in government is or isn't doing."
1,I hope the Spanish version can be uploaded soon. Many of people I know would benefit a lot from this video.
1,"This video was literally made for and about me. I been struggling with loneliness all my life. During my childhood (elementary school), I had “friends” but I always kept to myself because that’s just how I was built, I was passionate about getting good grades, music and chess, so I never cared about friends. Only when I reach middle school, I started caring about friendships and I found out my first friend. Since he was my first friend ever, me and him quickly became best friends. However, because of school popularity, since I was favored by the popular kids way more than him, he became jealous of me. The jealousy grew more and more when he found out I had a full family household when he only had his single mom, I was multi-talented when he was not, the girls he liked liked me instead and he got bullied everyday for being fat and ugly. I never changed the way I treated him cause I genuinely liked him as a friend and didn’t care about those things, however he didn’t see it that way. His jealousy turnt into action where he would lie on me to teachers, steal my artwork and steal my friends. In high school, I made friends with people easily because of my good looks and hair texture, but I never felt like I fit in or belonged. After high school and during college, I was focused on graduating so I didn’t have any contact with friends. So after I graduated, I tried to reach out to my high school friends but my plan failed because they had a new phone number and I had no other way to reach them. So I tried to see if I can contact old middle school friends since I felt closer to them more than I ever felt to my high school friends. So I reached out to the same first friend who was jealous of me. He lead me on, made me think he wanted to be friends with me again and then cut me off for no apparent reason. It was messed up cause his jealousy for me still is strong after a decade. I tried to reach out to another middle school friend who had a crush on me in middle school who is best friends with him and their friendship was founded on mutual hatred for me. She responded and I talked to her but since I knew she was best friends with the guy, I didn’t want her to try to hurt me again, so I was chill about it. However, she hasn’t contacted me in 2-3 weeks, she still has me added as a friend and I just don’t know what to do about her. I been also trying to make friends with people outside for the first time but my social anxiety is at an all time high so it’s almost impossible for me to make the first move with anyone so I’m dependent on other people talking to me first but nobody has the courage too. I been thinking about joining a martial art club soon in hopes of getting easy access to friends as well as learning how to skateboard and skating in the park. I don’t think I will be lonely forever cause I know there are people out there who would love to be my friend and would treat me right, so I just gotta work on me and be happy and i’ll find them soon enough."
1,"As someone who has a lot of friends, I’m tired and looking on how to be lonely"
1,Im pretty sure i have enough friends. It's just most of the time they forgot to invite me whenever they choose to hangout. Maybe i need to be proactive and invited them instead of just waiting to be invited
1,I would forever love your channel kurzgesagt loudly_crying_face you have the answers to everything I swear. This video hit me on a PERSONAL level.
1,i feel called out with that title
1,"I’m moving to university to become a dentist in two weeks. I have the social demand of an extrovert but awful social skills, I have a tendency to not show my true self to people out of fear of not being liked or being judged from poor past friendships so I try to remain almost personally anonymous. Hopefully I can try put that stuff behind me and make a proper social life for myself :)"
1,I don't know what youtube is trying to say to me after recommending this video but i am greatly offended and now i feel a need to watch it
1,The biggest science channel literally said touch the grass
1,"To be honest. I would want to see a second Part. Maybe even about the history of friendships. Friendships evolved with the culture. Philosophers wrote about friendships.
And Well also how Mental illness and other factors can influence a friendship. Etc.
In the whole topic is much more Potential."
1,"Pretty logical, no talk about psychological problems though like social anxiety etc."
1,"I have friends, but every one of them is online and too far to visit regularly. The problem with meeting like-minded people who live nearby, is that certain types of people are smaller groups of the population, and that means meeting another one of those types of people in a similar location to you is very unlikely. Friends is good but if they can't become close friends it still feels like you're missing something until you find someone who can become a close friend."
2,I liked Kurzgesagt better when it wasn't vacuous condescending prattle.
1,"""you are perfectly average"" that's all I needed to hear"
2,"I find the points about our earlier humans quite interesting.
I'd love to hear more about it."
1,"This gives me hope, humanity has never had it better nor worse than the modern day. We were not designed for this kind of society yet we push on."
1, i realized this the other day. there's a generation of kids who might have never known what it's like to go to your friends house almost everyday
1,"I thought I was just a shy introvert, until I moved out of my parents house to a new city.  Then reality hit me.  I suffer from severe social anxiety.  The cause: childhood trauma which I will not go into detail here.  Point is, everything seems so simple when explained by others, until I have to go out and become vulnerable again.  I've tried doing this without meds, but it seems I have no choice.  If I ever want to live a normal life, I'll have to start taking benzo's and SSRI's.  I'm a pharmacist so I already know the risks and benefits,  I just thought I'd do without it.  I thought I was strong enough. Haha lol, silly me.  Anyway, I love your channel and its content,  I'd love to see more medical and psychology related content such as this.  Sure I already know the answer, but there's just something about hearing your voice after a long miserable and disappointing day that makes life worth living.  Have a nice day."
2,Lmao because people suck and I don’t like them
2,"Good thing I'm a neutral, Just average friends."
2,Yay new video
2,Bold of you to assume I have no friends
1,Thanks for reading my mind.. I started uni a few days ago and I always feel inferior for some reason and I refrain from talking to people. I'll try to talk to more people from now on
1,"To make friends, you only have two options. You dominate or you suck up."
1,"It’s hard to have friends when everyone is 20+ minute drives away. We’re not in tighter communities anymore, we’re in these lonely suburbs."
2,I love how they released this on my first day of highschool
1,"I also hated the fact that teachers would switch seating charts for no reason? Sure, there may be a table that is disruptive but for every class? I mean come on. I struggle making friends and being next to someone in a table made it way more easier to talk to people. We would connect and- oh- we switch! All the sudden we're completely distant, we don't speak outside of class so the friendship just fades and then we graduate."
1,"Thank for you for doing this. In a time where it can be difficult to schedule things or even just have a place to meet people, in a calm environment.

you guys never cease to blow my damn mind.

and the wormhole pins? 
take my money."
1,"A year ago I had a problem in school my classmates that I was friends with started bullying me and I lost friends, they keep bullying me but atleast the teachers now know but it's hard to get friends in this time when people are like this:
Me: I read books and I like learning
Classmates: Laughs and bullies
That demotiwates me to go to school :( , but I keep beign strong and ignore them"
2,Kurzgesagt definitely knows their fanbase well lol
1,Jurassic Duck red_heart
1,7 on trending!!
1,"Watching this while ""Hello darkness my old friend"" plays in the background"
1,"Today I tried. I got remembered why I don't talk, such idiots."
0,nah I fuckin love being lonely i hate literally everyone
1,"Sometimes for me at least,recharges me in a sense again....being alone ( for short periods)"
2,Thanks for telling me to relax when doing things. It's helped me already!
1,This video is what we all needed! Sadly
1,frendship is overrated.
1,"Just came here to say... I'm not lonely, you are."
1,"""Lonliness as a situation can be corrected, as a state of mind it is incurable "" Vladimir Nabokov. 
I have found this to be true."
2,The key is to be happy by yourself.  Friends are transient.
1,meet up with the boiz
2,"I don’t need friends. When I was a student I had about 5 good friends. Since I started working, I just associate with colleagues, but no friendships. I don’t like gossip. I enjoy my own company. I am on the Internet when I’m free. I listen to music, watch you dramas etc. Some people don’t like to have people around them. I love my life. One can’t always please friends. If you’re confident, you don’t need others around you. Your best friend of today,could be your enemy of tomorrow. Not everybody enjoys the company of others. party_popperparty_popperparty_popperface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy"
1,"Thank so much for the guide, I really haven't been able to be around friends as much, I've been quite a lonelly human for a while now, because I have been not wanting to that for a while because of a person that did this thing that caused me to never want to hang out with people ever again, and now seeing this video for the frist time makes me want to do this now. I hope you have the best days and nights with your friends and family Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell."
1,"DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS GARBAGE, THIS IS PURE OPINION, THEY HAVE A VERY INCORRECT OUTLOOK ON THIS"
1,"I'm a 30 year old woman and have always struggled to connect with others, in my 2 highschool groups I was always just 'there' in each never made to feel a part of it. I'd try but I'm akward and my tastes didn't line up with the group. My main group had formed through who I thought was a best friend but it became apparent that was never the case. I would see on FB these get togethers and parties I was never invited to and it still stings all these years later. The only person I've ever fully connected to who gets me inside out is my wonderful fiance, he has a heart of gold and can brighten the lowest day. But I long for women to hang out with and do normal things with and it's even harder now since I don't think I'll be having children and most my age either do have kids or will. It's hard"
0,Life sucks
1,"I've always had a small social group, but the friends I had, I'd do anything for them. A few years ago, everything fell apart with two people I considered closer than family cutting off all contact. It sent me into a spiraling depression that I'm only now beginning to move past. COVID certainly didn't help either. Now I want to rebuild some kind of social circle. Loneliness is a horrible feeling"
1,"Nah. Too much work. I’ll work out, go to theater and travel alone."
1,"I'm an older man and I've tried all these suggestions. No long term successes. Men are largely competitive, defensive and poor at sharing and communicating. Also, the relationships very rarely expand beyond the shared activites. I've grown weary of bearing all the responsibility for maintaing relationships. So, while I remain active, I don't make any effort to make friends because experience has taught me that nothing will come of it. The rare friends I've made during my life we're effortless relationships. We both wanted to enjoy each other's company."
1,Finally! A video made just for me!
1,"When you get into midlife, everyone is taken. They all have what they need, they dont need you. And if you go awkward into a new group or sport, folks are like "" hey dude Im here to do sports, Im not to meet others , so gtfu simp"" . Only thing left are depressing lonely anonymous groups, yes wonderful, great start of a friendship with ""I suck, you too?"""
1,"yeah, a break-up shattered many friends, and once mom died, another shattered portion. Now I got 3 friends, and try dating apps. Its... meh. I do meet people at work though. Customers. Its ok."
1,Kurzgesagt is telling us how to touch grass lol.
1,"Living abroad and had a fall out with the central person in a friend group, which resulted in losing connection with the whole group. I was already in a vulnerable state and was struggling with my mental health. The past few months gave been tough, but now I'm moving past that and ready to gain new friends.
The timing of this video couldn't be more relevant."
1,Guess that explains why I retained pretty much no friends of mine except the one guy who I can not talk to for a year and still be besties with. My entire social circle were originally friends of my wife or friends of my old bestie. Whoops
2,It's alright buddy. Here have a hug people_hugging.
1,I have always felt like there's a big whole in my chest ever since 8th grade. I am socially akward as all hell and the few friends I have are far away and are doing their own thing. It's always felt like I'm in a sensory deprivation Chamber. I'd be a bit mischevious but they were just attempts for people to notice me.
1,"A a uni student just starting my year with huge fear of not making friends, this was a perfectly timed video. Ill be sure to use it in the future :)"
1,"I met my best friend through an online game 10 years ago, somehow we managed to continue to be best friends. At the end of this month we actually will finally get to meet each other irl."
1,I know this video most probably helped some people. But the fact that this video was needed is the most dystopian thing I have ever come across.
1,dam the title hits hard
2,"I'm sure I'm not the only one, but I'd love something like this regarding internet friendships. Some of the closest and longest-lasting friends I have are people I've only ever known online."
2,I do everything I can to not make friends.
1,This video will be great advice to many people out there. Hopefully we see a sequel on how to find romance
1,"When I see your videos I feel like there’s still people caring for each other and trying to do their best to build a better world and connect. The Egg video literally changed the way I perceive life, the universe and myself and had help me to become a better human being. And now coming out from maybe the worst depression I have ever been through, feeling disconnected from myself and others and trying to find a good, clear, “safe” path to reconnect with life. This video just came out of nowhere and gave me hope, once again thank you all in Kurzgesagt for all the love you put in your work and for giving us many of the greatest/coolest most interesting videos ever. 

The moon falling to earth, civilization collapse, the limits of humanity, the egg I mean those are the kind of topics that I would like to talk about with the new friends that I will make after watching this video!"
1,So what if you were lonely to begin with because of bad choiches your parents made. 30 years later i got just used to the fact that i am alone. And don't really long for a friendship anymore. Am i also then more likely to get sick or a have a shorter life?
1,Many of my friends have barely any interests that align with mine. If you're looking for friends/people to hang out with based on interests/opinions you're already going wrong. Just fine an *irl*social gathering and go there.
1," _""introverts, often confused with shy people, ...""_
so true."
1,Kuzgesagt coming to social issues from quantam phisics face_with_tears_of_joy......really appreciate that bruh
2,Friendships on average last 7 years. Be friends with your family. Family friendships last for life.
1,"Hey there waving_hand 
Let's be friends shall we?"
1,How did you know this was the video I needed?
1,Beautiful red_heart
1,your content is becoming extremely cringe
1,"I really want to thank you for this Kurzgesagt. Before when the pandemic started, I was really a happy person and an extrovert. I would talk to people who I dont know in school and become friends with them. Then, pandemic struck, I felt alone and lonely. There was no one talk to except for my parents. I was really depressed two years ago and I eventually became quiet. On those two years it was hard. I had to face to much problems and I had nothing to do but to go to school and doing same routine everyday. At present, I was really shy and afraid to talk to someone since its been a while talking to them 2 years ago, especially they totally became different from what they are before. Thank you for this video. This really helped me on how to make friends again and made me more confident. Thank you again.
I hope you see my comment ^^"
1,"dude, just as i entered a new school, i miss my friends
i wanna spend the next semester with them
thanks for the video"
1,Never clicked in a notification so fast
1,"Love the idea of meetings, but I'd rather avoid redditors tbh"
1,Why’d you click on this vid? face_with_monocle
1,I moved for school and have not yet a network :c
1,I am watching this on my birthday when I invited all my friends and no one showed up. I cried a lot today.
2,"“It’s never one person losing a friend, it’s two”
Wow, emotional damage!"
1,"Recommended. Algorithm heard me , and know im sadgrinning_face_with_sweat"
1,I been feeling lonely for the past 4 years. I used to have a network of friends thanks to a friend. Then he moved away. Ever since then it's been lonely. I tried to be friends with a girl but i felt she never cared about our friendship. And also because of the pandemic it made it hard to make new friends.
1,finally the video for me!
1,"This reminds me how whenever I ask my “friends” to hang out or sleepover at my place, they are always “busy”."
1,This hit home
1,Kurzgesagt you are amazing. Having a sub reddit for people to meet seems amazing
1,"Wow... I was literally just in deep thought about how isolated my life is without connection. Then this popped up on my phone notifications.

Divine intervention? Coincidence? A symptom of the times we're living in?"
1,"I'm so lonely. This was completely unhelpful. ""So it is worth going for it. Worst case, they're not interested, which will sting for a few hours..."" Do you mean days/weeks/months? Because that's how long rejection actually lasts, not hours. I'm sorry, but have none of the team at Kurzgesagt ever had someone reject a friendship? ""Hours"" my fucking ass. 

Edit: Also, WTF???? Loud music and spicy food are some of my most favorite things in the world but I'm a huge introvert. I didn't know the senses of taste and sound were SOOOOO important to being an introvert (sarcasm)"
1,"Leave Me Alone, Don't Reply grimacing_face"
1,"Friends are overrated, they only borrow money and never payback, remember you when they have problems and never called when they are happy.

This is the truth."
1,It's such an irony that the social media was meant to bring us closer together yet we've never felt so far apart since it's creation.
1,this video didn't have an intro
1,"This is the only video, I dislike thumbs_down"
1,"beautiful work, well done Kur team! red_heart"
1,"Man, I felt this.

I had a pretty bad falling out with a friend 2 years ago. About a month ago I tried reaching out to them to try and reconnect and repair what we had, but to no avail (no idea if my message was intentionally ignored or missed completely).

But that's life, you know. You can't get too stuck on things like that."
1,"HOW DID YOU KNEW I NEEDED IT RIGHT NOW BUT FOR ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP
around 10min is <33"
1, I I have that board game it’s called settlers of catan it’s a lot of fun
2,ok but why do I feel that loners watching this feel targeted lol /hj
1,"I wish there was a way to turn off the human biological need to be around people. I don't really like most people and prefer not to be around them, but I still feel lonely. I wish I could just be content being alone with no friends."
1,Moving constantly makes it really hard to maintain friendships
1,Thanks Kurzgesagt I really needed this red_heart
2,Can u be my friend?
1,I mean ... The timing!!
1,Funnily enough I actually made my first friend during and thanks the pandemic
1,"I’m starting a new school that merges 2 other schools and I only know like 4/10 of the people in all my classes, so thank you."
2,God I LOVE this channel so much!
1,"I'm not lonely because I have no friends, I'm lonely because all of my friends have girlfriends and the one girl I've confessed my feelings to is currently on vacation and said she wants to get to know me better first.
I am incredibly insecure about myself, so even her saying that she is interested in me is something that I doubt."
1,"Only generic women and other forms of children have friends, that's because they haven't overcome being riled my emotions and imagination. Actual adults have no friends, only acquaintances and associates."
1,"Wow. Going through a tough time in my life and feeling really alone. I googled “is having no true friends normal” yesterday, and today I see you post this. Maybe it’s a sign to not be so critical of myself and know others feel this way too."
1,I'm starting college in a few days so this one really hits home.
2,Ahh the perfect video for me smiling_face_with_tear
1,"literally talked to my homie today how we got no friends, pretty much the entirety of our friend group got consumed by opiates and benzodiazepines and won’t accept any help, so we don’t hang out with them no more. you hate to see it but i guess that’s just life. y’all stay strong out there."
1,This is coming from an atheist who believes the word god is another way of describing the drive that humans have to work together towards a common goal..... I just want to say... You are doing gods work.
1,"All the things mentioned here require money and time (so more money). If you're a poor, socially awkward, just moved person,  it's not as easy as organizing a dinner party. First of all,  hou can't afford a dinner better than a bare minimum, let alone a dinner party. I love Warhammer and Magic The Gathering: but are you aware cie expensive it is?"
1,"""Why You Are Lonely and How to Make Friends"" Bold of you to assume I'm lonely and don't have friends! But uhh great video, I might use this sometime."
1,"As someone dealing with depression and anxiety, and had many friends drift away; i don't think i have the energy i need for friends, and it just adds to the feeling of being broken, and loneliness."
1,People need to understand that being an introvert doesn’t mean you can’t have friends and can’t talk to people
1,"People I'll get along the best are the ones that also don't want to leave their home, and establishing a connection with them online is statistically improbable.

1,"*replying to thumbnail*:
Friends are easy to make. Buy a Ute(or ""pickup""). Everyone will become your friend.

Other than that, friends can be over rated... Get a dog. A dog keeps you happy sun up to sun down. The best friend and better than any anti depressant. smiling_face_with_heart-eyesdog_face"
1,Guys im an introvert pls send me ahmed_rashid313 im making a group lets take a step and socialize humansss
1,This video made me cry.
2,Lol I’m very introverted and I love spicy food.
1,I know the algorithm is supposed be personalised to me but when did it become so personal
2,I just need a friend with privileges.
1,BS many people want a lonely life and are happy about it
1,"Honestly, theres also a reason that people feel this way is because we as humans also want to know our purpose aside from avoiding the trigger of certain events in life that a ""past self"" has seen/experienced before."
1,"I think this has been a big issue in the post-pandemic social circles with teens. I found many of my students had very poor social interactions during the pandemic, and the change has become very apparent now things have settled and they’ve been able to socialise again."
2,"I am looking for a solution to make friends 
The solution is go and make friends"
2,Meh who needs friends?
1,Bro why am I getting so many of these???
1,"Some videos on YouTube are mind blowing in how good they are. I’ve moved 3 times and as many years, and compounded with the pandemic, things we hard. I left behind so many amazing friends, had to make new ones, then left those friends behind again. I went through incredibly difficult times, but also learned so much about how to make friendships and keep them. And you just summarized most of what I learned in 13 minutes. The one tip I feel should be emphasized is the power of reaching out. With the power of the internet, old friends are never truly gone. One call can leave you so invigorated, and be such a joy all around.

Anyway, I hope you all have a great life, and make some good friends along the way!"
0,I'm perfectly fine alone... and that scares the hell out of me
1,"Just watching this and the idea of being out anywhere around people gives me anxiety. But hey, AI is coming along well.. so there's that."
1,Does anyone else feel like they’ve never been invited to anything
1,">Me seeing the title pop up in notifications: ""Dude, uncool, I feel called out :("""
2,Thank you for the great video red_heart
1,"I’m feeling lonely rn wtf and I came to see an old vid from the channel about it and then I see this, talk about good timing"
0,Dont call me out with that clickbait. Shit hurts
1,"I don’t know why I keep watching these type videos, they always make me feel hopeless disappointed_face"
2,"Thank you youtube for knowing i need friends, i needed that."
1,imagine kurzgesagt uploading a video about how to not care what others think about you. It'd be golden
2,Remember it’s not how many friends you have it’s the kind of friends you have.
1,"Being and introverted extrovert, I don't like being around people; but, I also would like it if I enjoyed being around people. Some people find being around other people far too stressful."
1,I really needed that video
1,"wow, that's one of the worst videos you've created and the first one I stopped watching in 2/3 of the video. It's so bad cuz the tone of this video is like ""making friends isnt really that hard, there's million oppurtunities, if you fail then it means nothing, everyone is like that"" and then thousands of advices... please... stop it"
1,"Anyone free? I'm from Delhi, India."
1,"this is quite ironic for me right now 

since my friend just left me weeks ago"
1,"Its kinda a viscious cycle. I don't have many friends, so I have nobody to go out and do things with, but since I'm not going out and doing things, I'm not making new friends, which means I don't have friends to go out and do things with and... The snake continues to eat its own tail."
1,My life is get up goto work come home smoke goto bed and repeat
1,"Been going out for ten years by myself. I love live music. The places where I've made acquaintances, everyone just wants to do drugs with me. I don't like doing drugs... Can't get any connecting conversations out of them. Haven't made a legit friend yet."
2,"Unpopular Opinion: but as I've got older, I've realised that friendships don't last forever or friend's/people can be fake asf. So I've learned to stop caring about making friends or what people think about me. It's all just a waste of time. It's very rare to find a friendship that can last a long time or is genuine. Lol Friendships are like Relationships but without the affection and commitment part! Friends can betray you, get jealous of you, leave you out of the crowd and get rid of you whenever they want and feel like it. Also, friends can be soooo dramatic, I've had friends and they've made arguments over little things. Yeah, no thank you, I'm better off being on my own. I use to have a best friend in high school and we literally got on really well but as he got older and made other friends, he became more distant from me and started to treat me awful, that was like a slap in the face. Since then, I've realised that being on your own is way better because a friend could turn against you at any moment, just like that. I personally think that having a good friend or friends is just an illusion of how society want us to be like."

1,It's useless to make friends because all of them are selfie and they have their own ego ..if u are making friendship in this world then u will always get pain... better u make god as your friend and be depend on him..then u can seen there is no issue in your life...
1,ive met plenty of  ppl through online groupchats if anyone wants to join one on instagram reply and let me know!
1,"Im not gonna watch this because everyones had a different experience, personally my social life sucks and still sucks and will continue to suck because position of power was used against me and i didnt fight back. and everything variates in unfathomable ways. So sometimes like my case it doesnt matter what you do. You just do. And im not gonna even get a like on this probably."
1,You can't imagine how lonely my life is. I'm an introvert. I have no friends at all.

1,"This video is optimistic, and damn, how badly optimistic I want to be ! But we all know that this video is not going to help , not going to make you more interesting, more attractive or something like that, this video , no matter how beautiful and relevant servers no purposes except inducing the sence of pitty and awe for the people ( like me ) who are really struggling to find the sence of meaning in their lives.
This is the greatest peril in front of humanity, not terrorism, not the climate change but young individuals at the edge of total insanity. The worm is in the mind and heart , eating your soul from within."

1,"Real people don't exist and everyone acts like an AI, I'm done with this world."
1,"This is a pretty individualistic view of the problem, when a culture of being overworked / underpaid is the primary reason people don't have time anymore. Millennials / Gen Z literally cannot afford to spend time on friends while also taking care of themselves.
It's becoming quite the boomer trope to blame social media being addictive rather than acknowledge how wealth inequality is destroying our humanity and making a profit off of every moment of joy people used to get for free. People need downtime from extremely stressful jobs and life circumstances, hence why social media is so rampant. If we didn't need something to give us quick jolts of distraction from the impending doom that is our personal lives and world-at-large, social media would evaporate quite quickly."

1,"Because of my depression and my autism disabilities, it's really hard for me to make friends. Covid made it worse by being stuck at home all the time and feeling disconnected with life itself. I want to reconnect with the few friends that I did had and someday, I'd like a partner that'll share my sorrows and my interests. I'd like to forge new bonds someday if I get the chance ,but with how life is now, some days being by myself is also a way to reconnect with life in my own way."

1,"Coming from a chill extroverted guy , well once u get over the approach anxiety and start breaking ice with people , the next level is finding genuine and meaningful relationships which is a whole another ball game!"
1,"This video is another example of why Kurzgesagt is so special. They thoughtfully cover a wealth of subjects, from inconceivable magnitudes of the uni/multiverse to deeply personal concepts like what it means to be human. Thank you for being so compassionate!
And the meet up groups are such a good idea :)"
1,The timing lol. I just started my first year of college today and was feeling lonely goddamn.
2,Hobbies > Friends....if the friends do the same hobbies and are there then perfect! But sometimes I just wanna chill by myself.
1,I willingly cut off my connections since I feel detached to everything. I'm just using my family as something to anchor myself in life and not end up killing myself over something stupid. Also cowardice. Mostly cowardice.
1,"deleting tiktok has honestly been one of the best decisions ive made. sure, it felt connected and was somewhat entertaining at the time— however I never realized how consuming it was. you end up losing hours and hours falling into algorithms. my mental health took a major hit after months of being lost in that app. To anyone who has the app, I encourage you to reduce your time on it and see if it's really worth the time it takes up/the reality it feeds you"
1,it wont work nobody cares
2,I need friends crying_face
1,"Just a note I'd like to leave: you don't need many friends to feel like you're not alone, sometimes having a small, tightly knit group of friends you can count on is enough to keep you going!"
1,"In many cultures, even established cultures outside of the US, being shy and non-peopley can be seen as a bad thing. Even an insult."
2,squinting at this showing up in my recommendations
1,Visuals were so on point on this one!!!
1,"I don't have the mental energy for having friends. As an introvert, all of my energy is used up at my job. It really sucks, because my girlfriend wants to talk about her day and ask about mine as soon as I get home and it feels like a weight put on me when I need to just sit or lay down alone for a while to get some energy back."
1,5hoursago
1,"Oddly, I need this"
1,This video is so inspiring and motivating. I'll probably watch it everytime I feel like postponing a social call or social event. Thank you Kurzgesagt!
1,"Joining communities of people is impossible because they're already established and politely hostile towards people outside of the group since humans naturally resent change & outsiders. You are welcomed, but only as a gesture because it's not socially acceptable to tell you to go away out loud. The community might tolerate you, but you constantly feel unwelcome and like you're intruding thanks to a plethora of micro agressions and social gestures that aren't there for you but are for the older members. It's really difficult to force yourself onto other people to get past this stopgap, unless you've got excess ego to do it with and even then it's not guaranteed to work in a way that isn't disruptive or reductive. I personally just feel guilty trying to force myself somewhere where I'm not wanted.

Or maybe this is just my life experience as a neurodivergent person."
1,Everyone is always bussy
1,"I recently start to get social again after years of being the silent kids in school and this pop up, the timing put a smile on my face"
1,"A suggestion for people who like gaming:
Go onto some discussion website or discord group where you think the people there will be chill, and just ask if a few people there would be willing to set up a small gaming group. At first it may possibly be seen as a way for you to all play multiplayer games you wanted to play but didn't have the friends to do so, but eventually (if all goes well) you'll be looking for games to play just so you can spend more time together, or hopefully branching out into more than just games :)

(maybe suggest that the people who join your group make sure they live near-ish you. Or don't. Do what you like)"
1,Being a mechanistic sperg who sees the world only valid if “studies said so” does not work when it comes to have friends or generally being a person. The best advice for a watcher of this channel is “cut back being a nerd from time to time”… I know cause I’m one rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
1,"I remember how much it hurt when the pandemic started. I hadn’t realized how many people I was friends with by proxy. I lost connection to those “central hubs” and was left feeling like there was no one who wanted to be friends with me. The work I’ve been doing on myself over the last 2.5 years has been about no longer relying on a central hub, but building the courage to become one instead."

2,LoL players:
1,“And how to make friends” ah yes the one topic Kurzgesagt can’t explain to me.
0,A little hurt that YouTube chose to recommend this to me
1,Everyone is complaining about this. Yet they refuse to put the work to make friendships last. From communication to consistency and loyalty.
1,"Yeah, I’ve spent most of my adult life trying to form friendships and I always get burned. I’m not shy about giving people attention and people take advantage of that and me. So at 50 and after a particularly rough year, I’ve distanced from most people. I used to go out of my way to talk to new people and now, no… if they’re interested, they can approach me."

1,i am literally crying. thank you for this. i've been struggling with this issue for a long time and your advice is well received... thank you :)
1,I started getting into this situation after I started my family and my career took off.  Lost contact with a good chunk of my friends.  I randomly took up golf one day and ten years later I have a pretty complex social network.  The best thing to happen to my personal life (doesn't hurt on the professional side either.)
0,I send this to people as an insult
1,"""spend time with people"" yeah, ok, but how. where are these people?"
1,So much things to relate. Once again Kurzgesagt excels at questioning our own existential crisis and making sure in the end we don't do that.

Today is my first day starting college for the first time 5 years after graduating high school. I never had friends during that time with anxiety and managing major depression. I want to branch out to connect with others and make happy memories. I love the work and effort your team does with each video. Thank you! <3"

2,thanks now i cry
1,"Eh. I dunno. I've been something like 15 years (since late twenties) without any friends and you get used to it. Besides I'm so utterly boring because 80% of the time I don't have energy to go anywhere or do anything and the 20% of time I do it's always super exciting stuff like going for a walk (bonus points if you have a dog). 

Add the fact that I'm pretty intolerant of drunk people (don't drink myself), hate bar-life (useless waste of time), dislike/get sick from loud noises (no concerts for me thank you), grow very quiet when there are more than just a few other people around (especially if I don't know them), and have a deep seated fear of screwing up (I'm leery of trying anything where I might fail) and meh. Oh and let's not forget that I am prone to overanalyzing and like to avoid conflict (disagreements make me moody) while suffering from the ""know it all"" syndrome (even if in reality I know shit) and having the unfortunate habit of having very strong opinions (yes, you are clearly wrong) which I can't always rein back... 

Also my past experiences tell me that ""friends"" in general contact you when they need something. Usually when they want a driver, they have a heartache or just needed to vent, or need help with something such as moving. I guess that was partially my fault though since in general I prefer doing some stuff together or just talking while for most folks ""having fun"" seems to equal to going to a bar and getting smashed. Not so for me. 

Eh. Friendships, like relationships, are just a huge investment that are prone to go downhill..."
0,"evil evil evil, in the name of jesus christ i cast yee out of my body. amen"
1,"I think it strongly depends on where you live if people are open for new friends. Even in church people don't want to connect. They're friendly, but always have an excuse that they ""don't have time"" if you wanna do something."
1,"I ordered the gratitude journal, habit journal and a few posters a while ago. They arrived today and I can't express how happy I am.
Thank you so much.
I was given extra posters, which almost made me cry because they are so expensive (money conversion rate) to order from Australia. The quality and size is incredible and I can't wait for people to come over and see them. I have spent the majority of my afternoon just looking at them from the couch.
Thank you, thank you so much.
I have been at my lowest lately and this was the start of the best day I've had in over a year.
I started the gratitude journal and ran out of room talking about all the things I'm grateful for today.
Cheers guys, you've made one very sad Aussie change her mindset in such a short amount of time. I'll be forever grateful."

2,Right ..this recommendation hurts a bit but it is true.
1,These videos be getting personal
1,Was this targeted at me?
1,Literally get off your phones that’s it lol
1,I was gathering strength to watch this. scrolled past so many times before i clicked on this.
2,Why is this in my recommendations :/
0,"Can you like, not attack me personally Kurzgesagt?"
1,"i feel like friendship is somehow a double edged sword. im 22 now and so far i've experienced lots of friendships that just either didn't end well or just fade away. it pains me to be reminded everyday of the friends i once had and the blame i felt to why it ended. all those memories for nothing now but a reminder to just feel the pain.. yes it was beautiful. yes it can be beautiful. but unfortunately not every person are blessed with that blessing i think... to me now, meeting new people, starting new friendships, paints the idea of ""oh they're just passing by in my life, don't get too attached or i'll just pile even more pain to myself"". it's sad but i guess that's my reality. i do really find your self help video thingy series like this one really interesting and in a way, and hits close to me. so thankyou so much. i cant express just how meaningful it is for me!

to those out there that still have friends, real friends, close friends, i really hope u all keep em tight! i can confirm that being all alone with all bad memories, is more painful than hurting physically... i hope we all that is now going through a lot can survive and fight through... at least just try and do ur best.. because even if u fail, at least u fail knowing u did absolutely everything u can... exhausted all energy n resource, all cards, all options... i hope i can meet u all for real <3"

1,This will probably get buried but I've been suffering from autism and hyper anxiety leading to some... Interesting interactions and one of the only things that can help me get over the hang overs that come with these conditions is kurzgesagt. This channel is in fact the only reason I'm still alive. As I watched a video on depression from them that saved me from killing myself. Love Thomas
1,"I haven't had friends for around three years now, I've kinda hit a point where it's hard to remind myself that having friends makes me happy."
1,I call bullshit on . I was alone every single day in my years of elementary school/high school and it ended up making me the easy target to countless bullies and even a potential rapist...
1,"I taught a friend at an early age that getting a no isn't that bad, when I wanted to stay the night he often said, ""but my mom might say no"" so I kept pressuring him just to ask and he eventually did and she often said yes, this helped him to get over that nonsensical worry as he had a lot more to gain than to lose; never be afraid of simply asking, people who make fun of you for rejection are usually some of the worst people to hang around and you shouldn't care what they think."

1,"Ny situation has since gotten better, but in the past I simply wasn't making enough money to hang out with friends. I needed to work overtime a lot and didn’t have enough gas money to go anywhere."
1,"""The real answer to making friends is to put your electronic device away and go outside but we can't say that otherwise nobody will tune into our puff pieces on Youtube anymore so here's a 13 minute long video filled with a bunch of vague 'helpful advice' that sounds pleasant but simultaneously places the burden for your happiness entirely on your own shoulders (with subtle consumerist overtones, no less) while refusing to recognize the truth that there are many aspects of our society which breed isolation and loneliness systematically (such as this channel, for instance)"" - Kurzgesagt, probably"
2,Learn to care for yourself first before caring for others . The only way!
1,"I had to stop watching. Your advice can’t help me, but will only make things worse through the certainty of defeat. People avoid me and everybody finds damn good reasons to not be my friend. I’ve tried. I’ve tried like hell to build bridges and rapports. All I get are sidelong glances, as if to tell me, “Who the fuck do you think you are?”"
1,Legit every ep of this makes me feel… frisson I guess?  I don’t know why.  But this is like the only channel that can consistently feel this way
2,Ngl I feel really lonely having lost loved ones family and friends. Even broke up not long ago. I've all lost hope
1,Awesome video. You guys should consider doing one to explain antimatter and annihilation sometime. I don't see many videos that break it down as well as I know you guys could.
1,I’m a loser so this makes me happy knowing that someone like myself can acquire a “friend”… It’s probably because I’m too smart for people to handle. An alpha male surrounded by beta male cucks.

1,"This video is literally posted on the same day I moved to another country for university, thanks!"
1,"Maybe not the most important question right now, but did I spot a Silent Princess Flower reference or am I just going crazy ????"
1,"An inspiring, informed, and valuable video!  I really like Kurzgesagt’s videos like these which give immediately applicable advice in our own lives, and I feel sections of the messages presented here I still need to work on internalizing.  Considering the direction of these videos, I feel like a video by Kurzgesagt about romance could be direly important I this day and age.  I know I’m not the only one who thinks our perception of love can be toxic and horribly skewed, and a down-to-earth (pun intended) video with constructive, inwardly-focused advice would help a lot of people.  Just a thought; whatever videos Kurzgesagt decides to make they’ll all be amazing."
1,"It's better to be alone, then trust someone just to have them screw you over without a second thought. Better to be alone, then open yourself up to someone, just for them to either leave you, or betray you."
1,Just like the Loneliness video this one just left me feeling worst than I was before watching
1,I feel called out. I waited 3 weeks for you to put out a new video just to be told I need a friend. Lol.
1,"Pretty amazing, as always"
1,Amazing channel. I love the straightforward non-judgmental advice.
1,Also sometimes you're just surrounded by fake friends too and you have no choice but to leave to feel better. But the loneliness hits. But at least eh anxiety stops
1, and this is why i don't have tiktok
1,"How do you reconnect with people in a society that has made it inaccessible and disabling? I can't leave my house myself, i can't have a job, and when I go out where can I go to socialize in my wheelchair? My previous friends don't reach out and my neurotype makes online interaction difficult, social media algorithms are triggering, and i am human and want irl socializing! How do I make friends? I want friends...i watch lots of movies, i like plants and wheeling through the forest, i might die tomorrow but i really want to live today and i love meeting new people and learning new things. I liked this video...i just feel like the barriers disabled folk have makes this all the more challenging."

1,"personnaly I just talk about myself to the point of being overbearing and I don't really care if it's scary, because the people that will share their story with me afterward, are openminded and generally good ppl

2,i see now thx
2,I was talking with a friend about this...
2,"tq

1,"I've not made new friends since graduating from college and I'm 31 yo and I've just recently realised I push people away when they get too close aka becoming friends.  I just convinced myself I'm an introvert.

I feel the reason may be because of my  experience with friends during college. I was kinda used mentally for the ""money""  and honestly,  I'm not the kind of guy that likes to go to restaurants, to movies or to clubs.

I do have a very strong and healthy relations with my parents and family but i Legit fear this may or  will def affect my future relationship  with my future companion. May be I've untreated issues ..who knows !"
2,I have only one friend and i am marrying her eyes
1,The one Kurzgesagt episode that doesn't give you an existential crisis
1,I grew up in a very disfunctional household so pretty much took care of myself and did most things alone. Also prefer to do things alone. Never trusted people. And at 60    its nearly impossible at this point to befriend anyone even if I wanted to.
1,"Hey @kurzgesagt, I tried to look for a good place to research it but I am not sure how to proceed, here’s the details of what I’m going through:
I played a game before work, everything was normal until someone dc’d, then I dc’d, and I look back at my records in the game and somehow as it very much seems so as it isn’t much of a coincidence as not only have the days that ive played that game seemed terrible, but the matches I have seemed to be a struggle as well, is there something health related that I could maybe look at or is it something, like a spirit SOMEHOW influencing my day’s (yes I am very much ok if those who read this are concerned) it’s just it’s way too close way to frequent to be a coincidence"
1,"What if l live in deep, dying countryside, where everyone leaves to cities, and all is left is older people? But l prefer living in countryside, l prefer that lifestyle living near nature."
1,"I think for the why, it's partly because capitalism has systematically taken over or dismantled any community that can be a source of profit instead of free... the book Bowling Alone shows how the deterioration of social groups and clubs in America has lead to this loneliness epidemic. Online networks are by definition capitalized (servers, ads) and therefore much better than real life ones for the corporations that own them. So when you are stuck on Tik-tok for more time than you spend with IRL friends the reason is much deeper than just social media addictive lol. And all the reasons the video gave for lack of time are related to the work>>>life imbalance promoted by our money-hungry systems. If we all worked 30 hours a week we'd have 10 more hours to connect and that much less stress"
1,"As a schizoid, I have to keep reminding people who think they know better than I about my own life.
I'm alone.. not lonely.
There's a difference."
1,How do you get 20k views in 8 minsface_with_tears_of_joyred_heart
2,"Thank you, I needed this."
2,one of the best Kurzgesagt videos so far!!!
2,Your videos are simply amazing  its getting better and better every month  and I cold gain so much knowledge  just because of you thanks a lot never stop 7ploding
2,They posted at the best time
1,"CAN I request making video of virginity test, presence of intact hymen, blood on the sheet ,please?"
1,Me clicking so quickly might not be a good sign-
0,"Me too, I am so lonely. Loneliness is my normal."
1,What if you generally don't feel lonely and just don't want to have friends?
1,"I find that group context is very important. When i just go out on my own to some pub, i can find it very difficult to start conversations with people I don't know, but a few weeks ago, at a furry convention, I just joined a group of total strangers for a game of Cards Against Humanity and had fun, as these people were already within a peer group of sorts."
1,"I finally went out to a concert and got Covid, I don’t wanna go back out :/"
1,It is simple. Just do the things you like and you'll find that other have the same interest. It starts by going out the door. You are uniq but your interests aren't. Go get them tiger!flexed_biceps
1,"I definitely need medication to keep up, there is no connection to their politicing with my reality."
1,Very good video. Valuable even. but it's sad that there has to be a video like this... how disconnected a lot of people are nowadays. Thanks for making this!
1,“Dust off you Space Marines”…that hit deep red_heart
2,"These videos really make the world better, in my opinion.
Great job, and it helped me alot with how to make friends. I just wish that youtube had existed 17 years ago"
1,"What if the friend groups are already formed, and you got left out? :("
1,I WAS JUST THINKING 'OMG HOW TF DO I MAKE FRIEND'
1,Issue with making friends these days is that everyone indulges in drugs or some other shady stuff...
2,"pffff who need friends, dman ho need people haha"
0,This entire video is bullshit
1,"Ten years ago I moved to a different country, I was only 8. Until then you could say that I had quite a few friends. But even then as the years went by, looking at it now, my friend count went down and down. Some of my friends moved to another city or (like me) to another country. When I went on vacation a few years back the ones which I managed to see again changed a lot, couldn't recognise them nor they me and we had a lot of trouble connecting with eachother. 

 When we moved country it wasn't hard for me to learn the language, I was only 8, but everything was so strange. Every time I tried to communicate I got ignored or bullied. That is until one day an Italian boy come up to me. We became best friends. But other than him I really haven't made other friends, I don't have the same interests as a ""normal Dutch person"" nor do I have social skills to start a conversation. I say that I have the social skills of a stone. I hope that college will be different as there will be people from all over the world there."
1,All of those kurzgesagt videos make me feel sad and happy at the same time...
2,Wow incredible :)
1, someone using the word 'literally' in the correct context. Makes a refreshing change.
1,"I opened the video because I wanted to make friends, but 30 seconds into it I found out it'd make me live longer, so... nevermind"
1,"I miss my puyat buddy, the one who suggested this channel. Hope you're doing well engineer Evo!"
2,"This was amazing, thank you so much.smiling_face_with_halo"

1,Such an important topic! Especially now. Thanks for the video :)
1,literally me

1,i am a potpourri of thing that you guys said not to do
1,pandemic killed my relationship. it forced us to live together way to early in the relationship and it ultimately was too much. il forever wish you wellness and happiness louise even tho your gone from my life </3
1,"This is very useful to me, thanks! It never occurred to me that people wouldn't mind having more friends"
1,Bro why is this video aimed at me loudly_crying_face
1,"I feel so alone in my university, the pandemic stop me to make friends, it’s terrible to have lunch alone, to study alone, and this video came in the right time, I started to enter in groups, athletic groups"
1,Man you're really targeting me here kurzgesagt
2,I have a friend he had many circle of friends and it's really awkward everytime his friends comes over and call him to go
1,what does extroversion have to do with liking spicy food? i am an introvert and i love spicy food? or was that a figure of speech that i didnt get?
1,Appreciate that D&D shoutout! Also great explanation of introverts!
1,I agree. Uninstalling Tlktok can be the best decision in your life.
1,"as a person how has been lonely and deppressed i really am grateful for this type of content
that can change a persons life"
1,I don't like the way the video paints Introverts. Introverts still like to have friends and connections.
2,"I wonder if this video is going to create friends, that'd be cool"
1,"This all seems like a bad idea.
I mean, people are pretty terrible."
1,Im gonna send this to a friend who is a real a**hole for a few months already! Thx!
1,15th comment. I know you hate when people say that but that's rare for such a popular channel
1,"Pandemic has absolutely destroyed my casual friends. I have started a new job three months ago. It has been going great. But since we work remotely I know barely anyone besides our team. If I was working at an office, I could easily make work friends."
2,To be honest I have zero friends and haven't in at least 5+ years and I have never been happier
2,Youtube: recommended for you
1,you know you are a kurzgesagt viewer when you recognize an epic mountain score 10 seconds in.....
1,The fastest and the most qualitative way to get a friend is to go on an adventure together. Just look at Jojo.
1," has been my hardest barrier loudly_crying_face. Same reason I don’t date. Even worse than rejection, I think, is someone who says yes out of pity. If I invite someone to do something, I only do it if I’m 99% certain they want to spend the time with me."
1,One of my friends I met at secondary school. He had ginger hair and I asked him if he minded being called ginger knob. After he had punched me hard in the stomach we became good friends.

1,So you are telling me I will live short because of diseases?
2,I love how they represented relationships with plants and lightred_heart
1,"while this video is good, i don't like how it, and a number of other people, make the mistake of ascribing the problem of isolation in modern society to the covid lockdowns. society had been trending towards greater isolation and fewer real-life interpersonal connections for years prior to that, as social media usage became universal and screen time became omnipresent. the lockdowns certainly didn't help, but we've been headed this way for a long time now and unless we acknowledge the actual root causes, very little will change.

i hate to sound like the old guy ranting about how ""kids these days spend all their time on their newfangled gadgets"", but it's objectively true. nowadays, everybody from 5 year old kids to 60 year old grandmas spends all their time in front of screens, whether that be watching youtube or tik tok, playing video games, browsing social media, or talking to people on discord. we work in front of screens, go through school in front of screens... these days, even pursuing passions like art, writing or music is just sitting in front of a screen and drawing, typing or composing it out on a computer. there's hardly any reason to leave your house anymore, and as long as that's true, society at large will struggle with crippling loneliness."
0,this feels Like an INSULT.. LOLL
1,Please make a video on motivation it will help many people
0,I feel very insulted rn
2,I love this Channel!
1,"I was today years old when I learned extroverts are more likely to like spicy food.

2,Did you NEED to call me out like this?
1," hmmmm.....back then during high school....with friends.
University, friends. During senior years....alone
Marital years, wife n all the tag-alongs...."
1,This video got a huge number of views in a short time. Maybe this is a serious issue.
1,"It's funny how it usually goes: you get a new friend by some circumstance and get along with the friendgroup. Then you make some more friends because you are more self-aware. After a few months, however, you get overwhelmed and your dopamine levels are well above full so you get yourself time. You realize yoi didn't have much in commen with most of your ""friends"" and break contact. After about 1.5 years you realize how few friends you have. It then takes about 2 years to experience a new circumstance finding new contacts. In that time you filter the friends from the contacts from the toxic and the more often the cicle continues the more self relient and happy you become. You have more friends after each cicle but need less friends every time leaving you with a very short time in which freedom and friendship are perfectly balanced."
1,"Urgh, try to do these ideas in a tiny town that's racist, homophobic, misogynistic, and full of baby boomers (not my age). Not going to work unless you change your entire belief system."
2,So called friends are overrated
2,Thanks. Exactly when I need this.
1,Immediately click the link for meetup but Reddit is banned in Indonesia crying_face
2,If YouTube has an award for best picture every year this one deserves it
1,"Thats the thing caring too much. As ive witnessed the flow and changes in time and culture for many people, sometimes caring too much might feel very irritating or troublesome when directed to someone. I for one have gone through this, maybe its just me being dense or if i did something wrong but when i care too much for the other someway or the other friendship just drifts apart, and very fast at that. So afterall the friends i suddenly lost contact with I decided to not overcommit in newer friendships and treat them as a one time thing. Maybe internet has has also been a push for my narrative but if my over caring to someone leads to them drifting away due to me somehow getting too invasive in there life then whats the point in giving energy to something that wont even last long. But i guess with this in mind i also discovered that a friend who also cares back and even tries to make an effort in caring is a good friend and should be kept in close contact as they are one of the valuable and precious people you may encounter. Friendship shouldnt be in the very least a 1 off thing, both side should commit as it needs to 2 to actually tango"
2,Too lonely... recommend for you. Part 2
1,"Anyone doing the meeting in Reading, UK?"
1,"I just moved because I'm starting university in October and felt incredibly lonely because I am all alone in a new city and naturally gradually slipped into depression again. This helped, I know I will have to put in some work but I will be fine in the end. Thank you."

1,I thought this was a meme video not a literal one.
2,Thank you for giving me hope
1,"Related to this video, I think that Kurzgesagt would help some people if they made something about love/dating.
I think that the rules for making friends, making business (find costumers) and finding partners are the same.
But all of them require practice and gain resistance to rejection.
A great way to overcome rejection is to ""play"" to fail. For instance, have the goal of contacting 10 people every day, instead of getting 10 acceptances every day, then it's a game of numbers..."
2,Sounds like your audience don’t got friends — me either but I want it that way as you get older having a few is better
1,"The hardest is to find time for making friends. Society is expecting so awfully much from you if you wanna find a job these days. It's not enough to know one thing about the subject you're studying, no you need to be an all-rounder. Oh you only speak one foreign language? Not enough. Come back when you learned 3-4. But lacking social skills is also a reason to not get employed. There is just no time anymore."
1,"And sometimes making friends is about fighting yourself, your very own nature, your roots that shaped who you are at the moment. I can go through the whole day without speaking a word to anyone and be perfectly fine. Practically been all by myself for years. So for me, trying to make friends (or just socialising in general) is a step AFTER I'm done with establishing my second, more sociable personality. It's no joke, I am deliberately sabotaging my mind to be less closed-in"

1,"It's scary how kurzgesagt post this right at my friend-deprived, depressing moment of my life"
1,Shedshule
1,Kurzgesagt really do be caring about mental health.
1,Just moved to Oregon and finally starting school as a junior and let me just say it is so hard to make friends
1,"This is a very good video, really appreciate how it blends in the science with some practical ideas and ends on a good note. However, I've realised I've done pretty much all of this and still struggle to make friendships, even more so since I moved to a different country. I think it has to do with my personality as I don't really vibe that well with a lot of people (not in a bad way, just don't find it enjoyable to spend time together). But, there is also a thing I've noticed that even with a person who I like and we vibe together they just never put any effort into the friendship. There is never any initiative or they fail to maintain the friendship not because it's bad, but because it's not a priority to them and ultimately every single time other stuff in their life overshadows this. It's not that I can't form friendships, it's that I'm always a second choice after the romantic partner/work/life/other existing friends and when it finally comes to me they have no time or interest left."
1,"Maybe the world's governments should stop supporting the 1% rich and create opportunities to spread the wealth. The increase in loneliness and the lack of friendships is compounded by the dramatic widening gap between the 1% rich and the 99% non-rich. I've been forced to become a hermit, not by choice, but by economics. So while this is a nice reminder of the past times it really is not helping in the current world economy."
1,i don't know if i can do it. i am introverted and shy and it takes so much effort to go outside. just the knowledge that i have to go to work on a monday will keep me from sleeping at all. any attempt to reach out feels really bad. but... i can give the meet up a chance. if i can just follow through.
1,Anyone here wanna be my friend?? I am not much on social media this was always left out from my classmates but I do use reddit
1,"Possibly it's worth making a video on losing friends, through fights, lies, and just a general 'i don't like you any more' having experienced it in my life recently, I have the instinct to hold a grudge, like I always did. I'm pretty sure other people might find themselves in Similar situations."
1,I'm not that lonely actually :D tomorrow i'm going to a cinema with a someone who i randomly meet at a party. we both were extremely shy but somehow we started talking.
1,"As good and accurate as this video is. I often feel like I have to be the one to initiate activities with people and more often than not they end up being non-committal, standing me up or just admitting they don't prioritize our shared interest over most other stuff they like to do. Its really disheartening since I've had great friendships in the past that have lasted but had to move on because of life and it feels like the problem is me. I know its just a matter of finding the right people, but I live in a relatively small community and when people just don't feel like hanging out with you it can make you feel really lonely and inadequate."
2,I feel good to say for once in my life that I'm not lonely lol
2,Me with my 0 friends
1,My man is making BANK off the emo kids
1,"There's 1 thing that this video does not cover which heavily impacts the people you can have relationships with. Your class. You literally can't have long-lasting relationships with someone in a different class than you because one of the 2 people will not be able to afford the activities that the richer person wants to take part in. You can have a casual relationship but you will not be able to relate to eachother.

I know this is true because I my life is perpetual abject poverty due to a lifelong illness and I constantly have to forego social gatherings due to a lack of disposable income."
2,wow i really needed this
1,We will know AI has taken over the world when they start making friends!!!
1,"Better question, why don't I ever feel social?

Like my problem is the complete pop opposite. Everyone wants to be my friend but I don't want any.
Friends are just more people to just use me and give nothing in return.
When I asked my ""friends"" to help me with my fundraiser to get a RV and none of them were even willing to share the link to it.
I'm fucking homeless and they can't even be bothered to take 2 seconds to share a link."
1,"It is strange timing here. I recently went through an excessively horrible disease that I, at one point, was certain would kill me through progressive debilitation. Now that I'm recovering, I have learned that the disease itself is behind much of my depression and deep social awkwardness that I experienced earlier in life before the crisis point and now I find myself trying to rekindle long dead friendships and functionally return myself from the land of inevitable death.

To say that my task seems immense doesn't do it any justice so any help is welcome but it will still be one of the hardest social hurdles I will likely face in my life. IDK, I guess we all have our own battles and that is kinda at the core of those lacking the social connection they want in life."
1,"I do all of this and still have a hard time making friends. I message people and ask how they are regularly, I reach out and invite other, I go to Zumba and crochet club, I’m genuinely interested in other people and I’m pretty open about my own life. 

But I still get left on read. I still get people saying “I can’t this week, how about next week?” And then next week they have something going on again. And then the week after that too. It’s hard to know if it’s me, or if it’s other people not being good at making friends or if they genuinely are just too busy. It’s hard to be rejected over and over again."

1,"Hobby stores. rolling_on_the_floor_laughing After the pandemic. I'd be amazed if even two or three in my city survived and even then I bet my life that I just happen to be in the wrong part of the city and the only closest ""hobby store"" or ""club"" will be an hour or two away. I've heard this one a thousand times.

Heck, I've heard people recommend hanging out at comic book stores. I wouldn't mind had I had the money to actually get something since most store owners don't want motherf**kers loitering. Unfortunately that would most likely be once or twice a year because that's as often as I have free money to spend like that. The last time I visited a comic book store was probably when I was in sophomore year of high school. I didn't try to revisit the place until later Junior year. And they had already shut down by then. Cuz unfortunately they decided to put their business in your school full of poor kids. Kids who didn't have the extra change to get a Trudeau being sold by one of the school scouts or whatever let alone get a comic book or two or any sort of knick knack.

From my personal experience so far there is two primary reasons why most people are losing connections including myself. It could be because of both people are just one party. But usually the true primary reasons have to do with time and scheduling of course which was already mentioned in this video. A very good point. And money. Yes a friendship is free. You know it's not free? The gas to get to your friend.

That shit got more expensive. Bikes will be a nice option. If it wouldn't be a 40 minute drive. Once you're out of school, if y'all don't live close to each other then you're pretty much shit out of luck. I literally only moved a neighborhood over. It's at least a 15 to 20 minute drive to my place. But my guy ain't got the time for that. And after paying bills and doing groceries in a hard day of work he probably doesn't have enough gas to come over and chill. If you're looking for friends in the same goes for trying to get to that club or hobby store that is an hour away. By driving. Never mind walking or biking.

Ask for the point of people not really taking care of their friendships and considering it a priority, that's just the shit cherry on top of the shit Sundae. But I wouldn't be surprised if before the epidemic through water more hobby stores and club places. Now I don't even know where to look. I literally do not know where to look. Google isn't always very much helpful. And it has 90% of the internet's information.

That are they all closed down because of the epidemic which really screwed a lot of businesses over. That and maybe they did place themselves in poor locations just because the buildings were cheaper. I'm sorry, but it's hard to make money off of poor people when the only money they got is for the bills, rent, and the food to get them by barely having enough left to get some soap and cleaning supplies. Just because the friendship don't cost money in of itself don't mean that shit is free. And don't even give me started on being neurodivergent trying to be friends with neurotypicals. It's possible, and it's not like we aren't friends with other fellow neurodivergents. But we tend to be spread out amongst communities. Neighborhood communities. And I do know some neurotypicals who are decent people. But others, others know how to give you a list of reasons just to completely despise people. Treating us different and claiming we want special treatment when some of y'all literally cry that we act different and don't behave like you. Give me a break. Talk about self projecting."

1,"Me who's the quiet kid who has 0 friends but everyone tries to get me to talk, legit had this 1 girl try for like 1 1/2 year"
1,"It's definitely easier to make friends while you're in school but I lost context with all my childhood close friends because I moved schools many times, it's literally impossible to keep a strong friendship online and it doesn't feel the same either since you can't hang out with them like you used to when you lived near them. Also adults like to put on different faces so it's hard to actually find people with same interests and be also compatible whereas in school you see people as who they are because you see them everyday"
1,"Best advise from comments so far: do things that you really enjoy and keep your eyes open. Forcing yourself to do things you don't really enjoy just to find freiends is not as effective, people some kind of can sense if you are not true to youself."

2,Why you calling me out like that
1,"The saddest part of my friendship circle is that I got in a fight with a single friend, but they cut me off by complaining to everyone else and separating me from the group. Now I have no physical friends, and I only really talk to a single pair of internet friends that I play DnD with"

1,Tik tok is screwing with our lifes
1,"I don't want friends. People are smelly and will harm you the first chance they get. I'm already dependent enough in other portions of my life. I don't want to become emotionally dependent too. Sweets, alcohol, masturbation, video games and anything else that feels good can be nasty little parasites if you want control over yourself. Keep in mind that if you plan to tie yourself to something, you be absolutely sure it's good. With people, you just can't be sure, so be careful if you're playing that game. My heart goes out to those who still dare to seek fulfillment from others rather than from themselves."

1,getting ready for kurzgesagt to solve my social anxiety
1,If you have a few friends? That means you have a lot of  experience in life. I always move on and keep fighting for my goals. You all can make new friends anytime but beware avoid all toxic friends at all cost. They will drag you down to their levels of toxicity.

1,"The most interesting year of my life was when I was in my mid twenties and ended my friendships which didn’t serve me. It was also the year I then made lots of new friends by randomly invited myself to someone’s social circle and then said yes to invitations which followed after attending the first event. Quite unusual for an introvert like me to do , but I thought what did I have to lose? Met many interesting people and got out of my little bubble of existence. Yes it’s scary to put yourself out there, not everyone would like you inviting yourself (do at your own risk!) but it may lead to great adventures and meeting people from all walks of life."
1,Do one on relationship also
1,"I'm a friendless person for all my life because of my attitude. I'm shocked that there are at least 2 college classmates that stayed with me thru thick and thin. They are my best friends for like since 2013 lmao. Originally, we were a group of seven college friends. But because of misundertandings and realization that we don't share the same interests and attitude, we parted ways and broke our friendship. Now between the seven (including me) only two stayed with me. Because we finally realized our true colors. We had similarities and same interests that the others don't have maybe they share the same interests and attitude that we three lack but nevertheless, I'm surprised people stayed even though they know my true color. I only have two bestfriends since 2013. I never dreamed of many. 

""What will a million friends do when none of them are true when you need them in your most darkest days."" green_heart"
1,"Ok ok noted down...
but one thing:

I have social anxiety which worsened some time ago because of isolation so I ended up losing practically all my friends and becoming, well, more isolated.
Because of that I guess now I'm out of practice in talking with people or smth. For example, in my head, when I imagine myself talking about a passion of mine, I find tons of things to say, however when I actually gotta have a conversation with someone about that same thing, mind goes blank and I'm completely lost no matter who it is (and if that happens when I'm kinda knowledgeable about something, imagine when I'm not).

I know that what I need is time and practice but as much as I need it, people aren't patient enough to wait weeks or even months for me to get comfortable enough to do somewhat decent small talk (and that's understandable lol). I'm putting out efforts to try to socialize but I don't feel like it's getting me any closer to having even one extra buddy after literally more than a year (TT )

Thus here I am not knowing what to do. If anyone who has gone through this has any tips, I'd appreciate it a lot (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠)"
2,lol the video i need xD
1,"you know, this video just might be the turning point of my life"
1,İf people can see me we can be friends face_with_rolling_eyes
1,"This video was postee litteraly ont day after I moved out to another city, 500km from my hometown"
1,the part i really struggle with and why i dont really feel connected with anyone or anything so even when they like me it feels like a chore to keep it up until eventually we drift apart.
1,"This video really helps me alot especially that my country started implementing face to face classes, it been weeks since school started here and I still don't have any friends I'm an outcast in short.

I have a social anxiety and I also have a weird personality than your average person so making friends for me is really a tough job. I feel like if I don't act now I'll be an outcast this whole year."
1,Kurzgesagt actually cares about their audience and tries to inform and help their viewers red_heart
2,thanks kurzgesagt for the good advice
1,"Whenever Kurzgesagt talks about a problem caused by capitalism, the intelligence in their writer's brain just temporarily get blocked by their subconsciousness."
1,"Never finished any sort of school. Had no friends when I did go to school. No job and can't work. Don't have a possibility of even getting a job, because I have absolutely no grades. Live alone. Spend time online. People with similar interests to me regularly make it clear that if I don't have the same brain as them they do not like me. Every single community for something I enjoy has been infected with arguments and hating eachother. There's an expectation to have ""normal"" thoughts. And everyone has to be extreme. Don't know anybody. Don't know how people are. There are no groups for any of my interests even remotely near me. I am autistic and I do not know how to act around people. I don't know how to look normal. People online like to take pictures of strangers they find weird and openly mock them while hundreds join in. Even if there is someone who agrees with me on one topic, they would hate me for not having an opinion or mildly disagreeing with them on another."
2,Nice to hear im atleast on the right track lol.
1,What to do when you want friends but you can't stand most people because all anyone ever wants to do is drink and party and act stupid?
1,"When I was in middle school, I was not popular at all. I had barely any friends, and only sat in the back by myself, reading or daydreaming. It was a very small school, so you couldn’t really reach out to others. The friends that I had got clicky and drifted away. It was not fun, so I switched schools, and this gave me more time with friends outside of school and opportunities to make others. Point is, if you can’t seem to make friends, try new things, and put yourself in a different environment. Remember, friendship is a two way connection, to have a friend you need to be a friend."
1,I think Kurzgesagt have reached node lambda for their target market with this video.
1,next vid be like how to get bicthes (we cant its real)
1,"Yeah, I don't know. The worst feeling is to realize your so called friends really dont want to do anything with you, and that the group you used yo go with now goes by themselves. You feel so incredibly useless and unimportant, yet being now isolated and being unable to turn people I know into real friendships is really tough. I don't know, I feel like if I dont do them now, I am going to be alone for the rest of my life"
2,Hey can anyone wants to be my friend that why I am here I want friends pleading_facered_heart
1,"Maybe if people werent just using other for theire benefits..maybe they would stay...but nooo just use it and dispose of it, there is 8 bilion more on the internet so no problem...

This is a more deep problem, most people are stupid or evil, so good luck finding the good ones..."

2,People do not like me because I am unpleasant.....but thanks for the info
2,I miss when I was close friends with people I’d meet playing online games
2,why youtube recommends me this
1,"Make REAL friends, not those on social media"
2,It doesn’t matter

1,That introvert scene with music and rain has to be the best thing ever. I'd like to see 6 hours of it on repeat with some chill music
1,"As someone who is going to a new school this helped alot 
Also I’ve been backstabed by all my (now) old friends because i was trying to be funny andthey took advantage of that started bullying me for no reason 
I had to watch as other friends turned toxic at it sucks alot"
1,D- Don't get me wrong... I'm here because I'm subscribed
1,"For years, I've made an effort to reach out to people I've met at comic con styled conventions. It didn't really go too well in a span of a year, but we got along so very very well when were together.. and waiting a year to just hear them get back to you is far too long. I've learned alot about maintaining a connection with the few folks I met at these wonderful places and sadly it was all from mistakes I learned that, in a nutshell really, if they don't make the effort to talk to you, give them a chance or two. It might be a bad time, their quite busy in their life at the moment, were human and should understand humans get bogged down a bit sometimes. After those 2 chances though, you may want to tone it down on talking to them until they get back to you as it might seem like your a bit obsessed maybe. It's best to just let them go as their are millions of people in this world as the video stated are waiting to meet a person like you, so don't spend it with someone who makes you think that notion is in doubt. I don't like to talk about bad or negative things, but it's been quite hard. I'm sure folks understand, but it doesn't feel like it's enough. I will give an effort again at some point, I have too. How to harden myself from unsuccessful connections is something I'm still figuring out. Ty for reading my TED talk lol."
1,Ahh what the heck I was watching this video on 360p cuz my wifi trash but the animation is too good and colourful so I had to bear with the buffering on 1080p
1,"You put a pretty big emphasis on “not over doing it” my problem is that I don’t know what counts as too much or too little or just enough, a video detailing that would be great (if you can fit it in what I’m sure is your very busy schedule)."
1,"Too many videos are about mental health nowadays... Not that it's a bad thing, only the fact that it is needed..."

1,"Still silent about the War in Europe. Sadge. Sending you ""Hello"" from the Country of Air Alerts."
1,"It's legit nearly impossible for me to make friends regardless of what I do because oh how my parents limit me. I'm not allowed to many physical places with peers of my age, in homeschooled, I barely get to use devices, and other than my grandparents and my closest uncle and aunt I'm cut off from my much larger family. I always would jump at the thought of making friends and even tried online friends just to be able to talk to someone around my age but every time I do there is always resistance from them, taking days or weeks to reply, half hearted messages, and ignoring me completely for months even though I know their active. And I only ever had 1 real life friend and when the pandemic occurred I lost all connection to him because of my lack of a device and my mom and his mom almost never talked and they eventually forgot about each other. The very limited amount of people in my life is so fine I can remember every single person I have talked to for over 2 months in my life."
1,you know that by now tho
1,I see other men of culture have joined me
1,Damn this came out right as a started my freshmen year
1,"Is it just me or is it really hard to fully connect with people? I have always had a few friends which I've always been ok with, but these past few years (like 3 years-3 and a half maybe) I just feel like it's harder to connect to others, and even if I feel quite close to someone, it feels like something is missing I guess, especially when I'm sad. When I'm sad, I realise how unfulfilled I truly feel with friendships and how I don't feel that satisfied because it feels like I'm missing something.

And I see all my peers who seem really connected to their friends and I wonder how they have it. Maybe I haven't found my people yet, but sometimes I just feel different. Like I'll only feel truly connected to a few people in my life perhaps."
2,Helped not watched yetface_with_tears_of_joy!!!
1,lol just get off your phone its that easy
2,I feel like this is a problem for people who have little to offer lol
1,is it just me or is this channel slowly becoming less interesting by each video they upload
1,"I got a job at a restaurant with a bunch of other 20-30-something year olds and it's been a wonder for my social life.

Also, BE THE PERSON TO REACH OUT. Most of your friends that ""Don't hit you up anymore"" are thinking the same thing about you. Be the one to rekindle. Take initiative. I can almost gurantee you your old friends will be happy to hear from you, maybe they were just as depressed as you."
1,Fourth
1,Me seeing the thumbnail & title: how'd you know that?
1,"i only have friends online, i meet them once a year. i dont really see a point in having other friends, because those friends ive met irl, dont really have same hobby as me, so we cant really talk about what we like, since we cannot relate."

1,"My problem is not to make friends, but maintain them. If I was 20 I had about ten very good friends, now I´m 52 and I have barely 3. Yes, I know many pals, but real friends I have a few. Maybe I have some issue, because I'm the one calling them, not them calling me."

1,"I’ve had (and still do) have a hard time finding and making friends. This is because of having cerebral palsy, ADHD, anxiety, and persistent depressive disorder alongside the possibility of having autism.

I am also introverted and I really want to be able to make more friends, but socializing especially if it involves small talk and social gatherings that could overstimulate me and drain me of my energy, I find it really hard to make connections with others and thus making friends. I struggle with chronic loneliness ever since I was a kid due to social isolation from my disabilities."
1,"Nice that this is getting recognition, especially in this closed off electronic world."
1,"When I was at school, I actually noticed that, in general, people who were close together in the register/roll call (in alphabetical order by last name) were more friendly and spent more time with each other than people who were not close together. For example, the 2nd and 3rd people in the register would be closer than the first person and the last person."

2,Someone want to be friends?? grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,how was this posted at the most convenient time
1,"I had a past experience with terrible friendships several years ago. It messed me up mentally and I couldn’t make a friend ever since. I just turned 20 recently, doing fine on my own. But it feels very empty. The pandemic didn’t help either. I still have a couple of friends but after a while, they slowly drifting away. Somehow I can never make them stay."
1,"The truth is that not everyone needs contacts with other ppl, and not everyone feels loneliness in that same way. Some ppl if only really wanted they would make some new relations, but they don't do that coz they don't need that. Some ppl thinks they are lonely, but they don't even try to make new friends, coz they don't really need friends. There are also third group. Ppl that are lonely, want to make new friends, but they can't coz they are shy, they not talkactive etc. and it's real drama."
1,Being a 13 year old in 8th grade with few friends this video made me cry
1,"It is actually crazy to me that people have like 40+ friends that they text and talk to regularly! As an introvert, that would stress me out so much and that is IF I ever made that many friends lol. I have 2 close friends and a girlfriend... that is all I need. My phone is on Do Not Disturb all day and if my friends want to do anything, they can text me. It is a peaceful life."
2,Friends are okay as a WANT but not a NEED
1,"I was half expecting this video to be ""Stop watching youtube videos all day"""
1,Good video except for the part that blamed COVID for social issues. That was corrupt governments that did that. Most of sub-Saharan Africa didn't do anything to combat the virus and they aren't suffering from that decision.
1,I guess birds don't feel lonely cause I only saw any at the end of the video
1,In the end no one really cares about anyone but themselves and you'll always be alone no matter what you do.
1,All the autistic people of youtube is grateful of this video... i am sure red_heart
1,i never thought a science channel would tell me how to make friends.
1,"Sometimes while being lonely af , I feel like there is no one that I could call . 
Used to bother me some time ago but its just a part of life now lol"
2,Makes me sad to think I’m watching this I have a great friend group from high school but have struggled so hard expanding and making good friends in college
1," - ""Ask for comfort""?! I'm not female, I don't get to do that, under all and any circumstances. No one, literally no one would be receptive to such, even at the death of a close friend, 1st hand experience, twice separately. Yeah, the truth is if you're a guy and not in the LGBT, then you got one person when things are rough.
 - Not sure what the hidden punchline was there, but it sounds like a fractal level of ironic brutality. I love it."
1," I'm an introvert, but I like spicy food, but not ""adventurous food"" like organ meats and balot. Was that what you meant by spicy food? Or am I just an outlier?"
1,"I wasn't ready to watch this when it came out, but it still helped then. I'm ready now, and I think it's going to help a lot, here too."
1,"When you you are older , probably a college graduate you will realise how fun and great your teenage years where. I lost touch with all my high school friend due to going to a  different college. 

The older you get the harder it becomes to connect to other people and the lonelier you feel. This is something I have experienced. That's why it's important to keep in touch and maintain childhood friendships even into adulthood, no matter what .  You don't need to have too many , just one or two close friends will suffice."
2,Finally a perfect tutorial for me
2,Meaning brings us sense. Lifesense. Friends that share values are more likely to be good friends and to have more durable relationships.

1,"Christ alive reading these comments is like having my teeth pulled. You are all completely inept. Wallowing in self pity in the comments of a youtube video is going to do jack and shit for you. Why don't you try being friendly and approachable and start conversations with people? Find a hobby that you can hang out with people on Discord or in real life for and start talking to people. Protip: You're not owed any friends, try and take a genuine interest in other people and they might do the same for you. If they don't, move on to the next person. You can't and shouldn't be friends with every single person, if you are not getting on, it's you or them. Just try and think which and why and get on with your life."
1,"I am an introvert, I dont have friends but I have family by my side
My cousin was an extrovert and had a shitload of friends, girlfriends and party buddies. He died a week ago at 32 of age, alone, in a wheelchair, inside a filthy room filled with trash, empty alcohol bottles, cat feces and tons of psychiatric pills. In his funeral all his friend cried but none of them knew how bad he was in the last time.
I believe having people by your side that loves you through thick and thin is more important than the nowdays concept of ""friends"". 
I miss you cousin..."
1,"hey can anyone pls give me some advice I'll really appreciate it. So for some days there is that strong feeling of loneliness . I have friends but no one talks to me much, there is little interactions with me. I am the one who normally starts it off before they ever talk to me. I don't really have a good lasting convo it dies out less than a minute. Whenever a person in a group set up a date for all of us to hang out, I wouldn't get the info of date and time bc no one texts me. Legit I have contacts but no one talks to me literally. I sent a message saying hi but they just completely ignored me. Now I feel like an irrelevant , unimportant person. I've recently lost favour of 2 of my closest friends cus they favored her more . Deep down I feel lonely and empty despite the fact that I sat in a table of 6 people. I have no close friends no best friends, just friends that I never really talk to.

1,The fact that i only have 1 close friend is mainly because in my place there isn't people who have nearly the same interest as me which makes me sad cause i would love to play dnd or pc games but there is just no one i relate to with in school they all talk about football and stuff while i am the odd one out

Seems like nobody has room for new friends and they're fully content only spending time with their partners, especially after getting accustomed to it from covid.

1,The timing on this video couldn't be more accurate for me
1,"I do have one question from this video: how do you suggest getting somebody's attention to start a conversation, however short it many be? How would you remove or reduce the stress and self awareness that comes if the person is attractive? If the person likes to travel in groups it can be difficult, or if you only pass them in the hallway or something like that. Surely it doesn't have to be hard."
1,"I haven't had any friends since I was a very young child. I don't have contact with any other people. It can be hard at times, when loneliness kicks in, but it is a tempory feeling and I have adapted to this life,  at this stage, I don't think I could adjust to having another person wanting to be around me."

I wish I had a true friend who gives me emotional support because my own Mother doesn’t even give me that or even talks to me about my feelings. I wish someone would k!ll me"

1,"This video misses a big issue pushed by the mainstream in today's society: applying a special label to everyone. Instead of two genders, there's an ever growing list of made up genders with subtle differences that don't matter in the grand scheme of things.  Neuro divergent is becoming a new catch phrase with its own list of diseases (for lack of a better term) that also don't matter in the grand scheme of things. In the modern age of fighting racism and sexism, we have a return to segregation being pushed by those claiming to end those problems. The left hate the right, the right hates the left, and Trekkies and Star Wars fans are forever in battle.

With every new label, people will gravitate to whatever it is they think applies to them, and alienate from others that don't belong in their special group. With more labels, the more the group of possible people to socialize with shrinks, making it harder to find social commonalities. Emo Phillips has a comedy sketch that demonstrates this well. His delivery is a bit odd and takes a bit to get to the punchline, but it's worth a listen. Just search his name along worth Golden Gate Bridge."

1,"I moved away for graduate school and have had this exact feeling. I made friends quickly in undergrad but in grad school I haven’t made any. I’d like to go hang out and do things but don’t have the money for it. It’s difficult to spend time with my friends I’ve made already since I’m so far away, and the lack of funds. I’m afraid they will forget about me and stop talking to me eventually."

So making friends for me is almost impossible and I've grown almost too used to having no friends so I don't know how to treat them if I had them. On top of that I have insecurities that prevent me from enjoying myself around others if we talk about any personal stuff, so that's painful.

1,"Schedules do not align, and then many activities are something I find boring. I prefer to work with ideas, long-term plans, strategies, contingencies, opportunities, debates and brainstorming etc. The friend group I want is one who wants to start an unofficial company and get together periodically like board members would. To have a shared goal, a common cause. A reason to be brought together or to contribute and connect. Something worth the effort."
1,Nowadays its not about how u make friends. Its now about how u stay friends.

1,As an introvert it's super disheartening to reach out and try to organize things but have relationships remain largely the same as they were before. It feels like you put in such a huge effort to interact with others only to have everyone go back to not really remembering that you exist.

1,"I lost so my friends after the pandemic started and I failed to reconcile those friendships. I used to be very happy, I used to get a lot of human interaction everyday but it's all gone since last 2 years. I am extremely lonely, I feel sad seeing people sharing having the best time of their lives on social media."
1,"It's rare for me to tear up while watching a video, but I saw so much of myself and my few close friends here. I had to learn all of these things the slow and hard way - with both ADHD and autism, it didn't really come ""naturally"" to me at all. But it was incredibly validating to recognize my own social growth in this video and learn I'm actually doing it ""right"" now, more or less. 

There's an odd little difference that comes from being ADHD: we don't always experience ""relationship decay"" over time. Our potted plants don't wilt much, if at all, to borrow your metaphor. I can contact someone I haven't heard from in months, and for me it's just like we spoke yesterday. For them, it might be like I've been ignoring them, or they forgot I exist... It can be a bitter surprise. I know this on a conscious level, so I do my best these days to not let months go by before I reach out. But it's a little-known mental difference, and I thought it might help others like me if they see it mentioned here. It's hard to accommodate all our differences, but it's easier when we have words for the things. Might also be why I get along great with other ADHD people: we have disconnects with other people, but our similar symptoms mean we don't have to work as hard to meet in the middle. Just means we have to be more mindful with everyone else :>"

1,"Jesus christ dude, anything but the _ACTUAL_ problem: CAPITALISM, hollowing out all social meaning and trust to be sold for profit and leading to an ouroboros of resentment and a headlong thanatos embrace toward the ""common ruin of the contending classes.""

2 + 2...yeah, it's 4 actually. Wake the fuck up, jesus. Hell, that was the whole spiel/impact of that Jesus guy himself, leading basically a more mystified class consciousness against the Roman occupation through that whole god thing, the Roman empire then fucking this dialectic up in meaning when later rhetorically adopting the values to quell revolt (gee, sound familiar...) that could only be in understood in a context of domination/empire (you know, like the one the US has over the earth and will never admit, ie IMF/World Bank financial system control imposing this post-WWII).

The world sucks for a god damn reason. We need to OPEN OUR EYES or we are absolutely fucked, this is not a fucking individual problem, and in fact _nothing_ is.

To echo Rosa Luxemburg from 1918 Germany, before of course being executed by the freikorps paramilitary (later becoming the SS, shocker) at the behest of Ebert's ostensibly _social democratic_ SPD party, almost immediately resonating the truth of such a succinct political dichotomy to this day:

*Socialism or [continued] barbarism.*"
1,"This video hits especially hard as someone recently diagnosed with ADHD. The first few years of my undergraduate, I thrived socially, threw parties every week, and found myself actively in many different groups and niches. I had no issues making myself available, and part of this, as the video stated, was due to the fact that I was in close proximity with everyone. I didn't have to deal with the ""ADHD waiting mode"" of dealing with scheduling hangouts with others, nor did I suffer from the fallout of the ""ADHD lack of object constancy"" that is responsible for not prioritizing people as interactions decrease.

But then COVID hit, we started diverging our schedules, took different classes, and people eventually graduated and got jobs. Now, being friends involves scheduling appointments and planning time outside of our 9-to-5s, so the aforementioned ""waiting mode"" and ""lack of object permanency/constancy"" really started to shine, to my dismay. So far, I still get an instream of people asking me to hang out and catch up, but the monkey brain just tells me to grind more, play ULTRAKILL, and do other adult-y things than pay the increased cognitive price of hanging out with people (which is scheduling stress). Furthermore, the fact that my increasing workload as a software developer is more ""in my field of view"" than my friends, that's what my brain is fixated on right now. In a tale as old as time, I feel I won't garner a sense of urgency until it is too late. It seems, paradoxically, despite having more friend groups than ever, I've never felt more socially isolated.

Funnily enough, I see a number of comments from people on the receiving end of this behaviour of mine, so allow me to apologize on behalf of those people like me! ;P

In seeking treatment (as of recently), I am slowly regaining my social sense and I'm trying to add more synchronicity in my calendar (I've been putting off errands, financial appointments, and haircuts for the past few months, but this morning I fixed all of that) in an attempt to reverse off the damage that ""waiting mode"" has already caused me during COVID, but as someone approaching mid-20s, the idea of ""socializing as a 9-to-5 wageslave"" is definitely going to be an uphill battle.

Eye-opening video!"

I think I can do without them but in the end I just slowly lose myself in my head and look for escape in drugs and music. I sometimes think it's not even worth it to try to get to know others. Like it's just easier to do nothing and be miserable I suppose.
Also I feel like everything that I don't enjoy straight away and or helps my career is a waste of time. Sure it might be good for me. Sure it might give me meaning and make me feel like I have a purpose but like.. thats not enough. I don't care about my own happiness."
1,"I guess my turn how to teach how one person should get a friend, Feeling worthless? No worries, Try to find one that sticks out of the group, Never befriended any popular kids (trust me, If you were friends on some influential people, You might drag them down because sometimes they be calling names and do a lot of traitorous work) Hmmm, If you want a girl-friend? Try to make them laugh, Aw gotten the conversation duller and awkward? remember some dad jokes or a line you should repeat from what conversation you attempted to make, For example: ""Sure I do love Anime don't I?"" ""..."" ""Oh btw, Did I mention more animes that I discussed?"" (Don't use it, It's kinda my thing and we all have our styles on making a conversation) Also, Be yourself.

I've talked to a lot of people (which is unusual for me, I'm a deep introvert) and we even had some activities together but it feels like... it is empty activities. They are not genuine. People just go out to drink until they pass out and smoke because it is 'cool'. Whenever I try to have a genuine talk about interests or ideas or anything people lose interest in me and I do not know why, I am honest and I listen to the other person while they don't really care, they lose interest quickly. It is like they meet me and other people only to burn time. I'm chilling in my room right now and I don't mind being alone but I get depression whenever I see couples or happy people and think 'what went wrong with me'"

1,"I am lonely because the most profitable land buying and selling for housing mechanisms lead to housing that resulted in me being as far away from as many people as possible in a location requiring an expensive vehicle to operate to fulfill any task that requires more people, and the cost of my living expenses requires me to overwork myself to the point that I'm mentally and physically exhausted, taking up most of my time at work and then what free time and energy I have left managing the vital aspects of my life so that I can continue to live.




I'm being exploited, and odds are if you're reading this, so are you. It's almost entirely capitalism's fault. People weren't lonely in other systems of economics. We can keep the democracy and lose the capitalism. There's no real reason why our record productivity can't go back towards ourselves, and take a larger piece of what we produce, and work fewer hours.

Twenty hours should be considered full time. You should be able to afford a house and a family working twenty hours, maybe thirty between two people. The money is there. Your bosses are just taking it from your pocket."

1,"I have friends.  However, I'm a senior citizen.
  At my stage of life we're all busy with family and retirement.  None has time for just hanging out like the old days*.
  We don't drink in public.  We seldom go out to gather (our 50th reunion just passed-I went because of peer pressure; not enjoyment.  Crowds are hell on me).  Most of our excursions are with family-not friends.  
  I do get tagged to comfort others.  The reverse is conspicuous by its absence.  Thing is, I understand it.
  See, it isn't about mutual comforting at all.  It's all about dominance.  I give my time to comfort others, but they're too ""important"" to 'waste"" time on me.  That's a basic social interaction: ""I'm better than you, so I don't need to waste my time on you.""
  I get it a lot.
  What's the underlying motive?  Social anxiety and angst.  Not mine.  Theirs.
  I'm comfortable with myself.  I achieve in different realms and it disturbs those who've not yet chosen an identity**.  This ""forces"" them to react by minimizing my contributions.
  I don't mind . . . usually.
  I won't be remembered; I'm not ""important enough"".  And, sadly, I don't care if those cheap souled bastards live, die, or explode in mid-air.  So your glowing referral to friendship and its various positive constructs falls short of my experience. 
  As I purported above, I have friends.  I just don't depend on them for anything.  My friends share art and artistry.
  In my view, we're all wounded souls.  Trauma is trauma, even if one person's trauma does not scourge another.  You takes your ticket and you rides your ride.  In the end, no matter how many gather around your deathbed, you die alone.
*Except the alcoholics.  By this time, most have the shakes (Delirium tremens).

1,"Throughout more than half of my life, I’ve failed to make connections with others because I could never connect well. I misunderstood what made up a conversation, and ended up making myself look weird, when I’m reality, I just couldn’t express myself and my thoughts in a normal way; as a result, was looked at as the “weird kid”. As time went on, I didn’t want to open up to other people anymore because I thought it’d be the same situation where I’d just be looked at weirdly, eventually leading me to dig too far deep into a hole that I just wasn’t connecting with anyone, and I would never have a real friend. I would never open up myself, even to close family, was never invited to anything, and the little times I was, I’d just turn it down. This video really opened up my eyes. Thank you."

1,Okay. I ain't bad with making friends but now lesson 2... How to get a boyfriend/ husband. Please pleading_facepleading_facepleading_facepleading_facepleading_facepleading_face
1,I am 92%+ introvert (that's pretty much extreme level) and I love extremely spicy food.
1,"""It's never only one person losing a friendship it's always at least two"". This point is so powerful, yet easily overlooked. Great video!"
1,This channel can talk about existential dread and black holes but it’s on thin ice if it’s gonna call me a loser
1,Keep it up grinning_facered_heart
1,"My parents were so dumb they thought it was a good thing I was at home all day playing video games instead of “doing drugs” fucking abusive religious morons.

For anyone who wants to isolate their kids just know it will severely damage them and they absolutely will end up using drugs to cope."
2,i can’t even get friends because they all just don’t care about me or they ghost me. friends are ruined for me
1,Thank you. I think we all collectively needed this.
1,This is literally how I’ve been feeling for THREE WEEKS. Thanks for this.

2,can someone here by my friend
2,"great, now i understand friendship, next, actual relationships should be a cakewalk, right?"
1,I need to make a summary of this video
1,news: it is to late
2,Probably the best timing for me.
1,Thanks for rubing salt on the wound
1,I’m 13 and live in a Ukrainian family I’m homeschooled due to problems at school and I dont have many friends ans any friends I do have are American and my parents won’t Let me see them out of some lessons and they won’t let me have a phone so I can’t stay connected wtf do I do
1,Why do I feel like this video was specifically targeted towards me.
2,"How to make friends:

Society: Just be yourself!
Also Society: Not like that!"
1,"I'll say this a million times - Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and especially TikTok are a detriment to society. Especially to Millennials and Gen Z. Get off social media and meet people in person. All the best friends in my life were met in school, through hobbies, and through getting off my butt and working for my connections with others. You have to work for your friendships, get out there and make an effort"
2,"When I read the title I was kinda offended, but it was true. But I love this video. wish all you guys luck on making new friends!"
1,"One thing I’m working on in therapy is my tendency to write people off prematurely. If I get the sense that I don’t connect with the people I’m with (particularly people in a different life stage than me), my flight or flight (yes, I meant that) kicks in and every cell in my body wants to leave and be alone. It’s a part of me that’s just trying to protect me from rejection and the shame of not belonging, but this part assumes I don’t share anything in common with people before I’ve even gotten to know them. It’s also a relic of my college years, where I felt like a third wheel amongst my group of friends. Now that I’m in my 30s and look back, I’ve actually made close friends with and even had romantic relationships with people whom, on the surface, would never seem compatible with me and yet somehow we made a genuine connection anyway. I learned that I can really belong almost anywhere with almost anyone. It’s something I can take comfort and pride in as I try to get over my social hang-ups."
1,"Still grateful to kindergarten me who decided to speak with that new guy and so, gave me a best friends for life"
1,"This moved me more than I thought it would. 

LARGE VENT WARNING:

Being honest, I have no idea how to balance life with friends. I’m usually not allowed to/too busy to meet up with my friends outside of school, and in the next day of school, all they talk of what they did outside of school. I find myself struggling to keep up a conversation because so many other things are going on in my mind with no idea of what to talk about. When I do have time to talk with them, I find out that they were busy.

Busy together.

Busy without me.

Sometimes, I catch myself not even adding to the conversation, just hoping when that “perfect moment” to jump into it, only it find that it’ll never happen. There’s a friend who’s going through a lot; I try to comfort them, but it feels as if my words never reach them. The only nice conversation where a friend and I actually talked together is something I cherish. I replay it in my head, wishing it would’ve lasted forever. I don’t want to picture myself, lonely forever and not knowing how to make a conversation, stuck in my room watching YT. I want to go out with my friends and make that conversation I had an infinite amount of times, again and again. Because of this video, hopefully I can. This moved me more than I thought it would. 

Sorry for wasting your time."
2,Its like this video is specifically for me
1,"Basically ask to hangout with people. And the way you can find these people is trough shared hobbies, work and school."
1,Noticing a severe lack of ducks.They must be serious about this
2,Need this Lol
1,"Ever noticed that the more connected we all are, the more isolated we become? The more we are compelled to anchor our identities, experience and memory upon an external world, the lonelier and less certain this inner self becomes? Having once passed over the event horizon of self-accelerating sociotechnical metamorphosis we are each and all just as trapped and haunted by hyper-inflating dependency as we could ever be released and united by the degrees of freedom made available by all of this complexity and choice. There is really nothing to do but to keep falling...

...I'll see myself out."
1,i dont have single friend since basic shcool. I finished university now.
1,Get a life and stop liveing i my Walls
2," love the ""lemon"" amp and cab, nice touch"
2,Great video
1,Welcome to another episode of kurzgesagt roasts viewers via youtube titles and/or thumbnails
1,Rolls eyes once again
2,"dear Kurzgesagt, get out of my head with your recommendations"
1,"Hello can I request you to make an option for Indonesia Region? :) altho I don't know if there is much Indonesian that followed you, yet it would be great and fun for us. Thanks kurzgesagt!"
1,"Errr What? Not a doomsday video? someone hacked Kurzgesagt :) 
but this a brilliant video and as many said this video came out in time :) Thanks for the hard work."
1,after the covid lock downs i don't care to be alone and actually like it
1,"Im starting college tommorow and im kinda nervous since this is a new start completely different from HS where im hopeful that im gonna find more like-minded ppl with whom i can form relationships more easily
Thank u for this video . It put aome stuff in prespective for me and gave me a nice push. Hopefully tommorow goes well!"
1,Me watching this knowing full well I'm not going to take whatever advice is given
1,This is an excellent instructional video for our future AI overlords.
1,"This video is simply brilliant. I am a psychologist myself, and I have a client (14 year old shy and introvert boy) who struggles finding new friends. I am seriously thinking about sharing this video with him, because it's so wonderfully packed, informative, practice-oriented, and full of useful information. I am convinced that he can learn a lot from this. 
Thank you very much, Kurzgesagt!"
1,The roots of my friend circle have been ripped out and now I must start back out with growing a small and fragile seed
1,plz korean subtitles crying_face
1,"Dang, you have read my mind"
1,I need that video
1,So wholesome. Just down to earth advice that I already knew but needed to be reminded. I'm actually gonna get in touch with a friend I haven't seen in a year. What a great channel.
1,"Reciprocity has been the biggest factor keeping me from developing more meaningful relationships. I simply abhor self-centered, greedy, arrogant ppl who wouldn't know how to actively listen if their lives depended on it. I'd rather spend time with a cold....at least the cold should strengthen my immune system. Ppl like that just weaken my tolerance for stupidity."
1,"I could nitpick some things I think are more complicated and be my usual grumpy self, but I love this video too much and your optimistic, non-judgemental approach to this when this is so little talked about. Thank you."
1,I like spicy and mild food. I enjoy loud music and partying. I also enjoy  a quiet night in. I like a board game with friends and bike rides with or without people. Am I an intervert? Extravert?
0,the music timing brings depression wtf :(
1,this seems like alot of work. i will go back to my cave now.
2,I don’t need friends they disappoint me
1,"Why is this in my reccomended
C'mon YouTube why are you doing this to me!
I have friends they just dont want to speak to me right now..."
1,"Although I do enjoy the message of the video, as a someone who mainly forms meaningful relationships in online spaces, the overwhelming emphasis on spending time with them in real life was a bit jarring. It's a lot easier at least for some people to find likeminded people in online spaces, like in a social video games. I fail to see how my friendship with someone with whom I spend time almost daily doing something together, albeit in a game, is less valuable or less real just because we are not able to occupy the same space in real life. Otherwise superb video, but I was wondering if this aspect was rubbing anyone else the wrong way?"
1,Gibberish..these videos just get worse and worse
1,"Instead of doing my mistake of crying to bed abt this, listen to god and pray. 
Memorise the Quran and god will help you with anything you need."
1,"Well its not that easy when life throws idiots and people with no ambitions all around you, I wouldn't want to be a friend with most people I know irl, I just value my time and I believe that spending it with any of them won't be a good investment. I keep wishing for someone special to show up, but I already know inside that waiting for external forces is never the right solution."
1,"found this video in just a right time. right now i'm surrounded fear this fear of losing a friend. there's no exact reason we would stopped being friend. it's just that when she got this new job, she becomes extremely busy. too busy to contact any of her friends, including me. i began to feel the distance between us, and it scares me. 

but the only thing i can do is to give her time to adjust her life, and someday we'll meet again"
1,"Where’d you find that kurzgesagt? ‘One of the perplexities of life is that to get something, it can often be helpful to convince yourself you don’t want it so much’. I want to know how true this is"
1,I haven't watched the video but I'm guessing using Facebook and other social media isn't the answer.
1,I’ve seen the first video u guys have done on loneliness and I’m a fellow with autism and ADHD and I have struggled all my life to have friends and the ones I did have were all washed away because I had to move now I’m stuck and I feel like I may have slight social anxiety and maybe chronic loneliness but I just wanted to put this comment out there and say thanks legit thank u guys so much you guys do not know how much this channel has impacted people in a good way it’s quite incredible and u guys have helped me understand myself and people around me thanks so much
2,"Kurzgesagt: Friendships can be like houseplants that need regular care and attention.
Me, looking at my plant graveyard: ""Well crap."""
1,I ended multiple 20+ year relationships because after multiple decades none of them knew how to be a good friend. They had no complaints that they made me aware of and I brought up a little as it happened and that was too much.
1,the secret is nofap and soberiety
1,"I began to watch this channel for studying  English, but today's video imprssed me. Graphic is also intuitive."
1,"Love the Peter Gabriel reference at  ... to the artist that came up with that, your efforts were not unseen ..."
1,"Why you dont have friends? Honest answear: you are not likeable, therefore no one talks to you first, and people ghost you even if you talk to them first. You are boring and have bad energy so people avoid you because they feel better without you than with you around."
2,"I’m officially opening a club called the lonely club 
And in it we will all come together and be friends 
Because I just want friends"
1,"Why am I lonely and don't have any friends?? Easy; because I'm living in the wrong planet. Time to load up the 357 Mag and call it a day on planet earth, boys and girls."
1,"""Why You Are Lonely and How to Make Friends"" Is really a longer way of saying 'car-centric society sucks'"
1,This is what i’ve been waiting for…..
2,What is friend?
1,"Does having online friends count? I have a few friends online. It feels easier to connect with poeple online rather than in person. I recently moved to a new city (more of a village), and I started high school this year (grade 9), and so far its been quite difficult talking to people, all I say normally is ""Thank you"" and ""Your welcome""."
1,"Ugh, waiting months at a time for some pseudo intellectual video? Come on kurzgesagt you're better than this"
2,"This Video: Plants are friends too, when you don't spend more time with them they just die."
1,Bro I swear kurgesagt voice is so calming it's almost like you'll listen to everything he'll say even if it's very fucked up
2,"The narrators voice is so calming, if he were to break into my house with a gun and shoots me in the arm, I would still be calm if he said calm down lmao"
1,This one hits hard but encouraging at the same time.
0,The title of this video should be renamed to “How to stop being a discord mod”
1,How we will be able to terraform mercury
1,I used to have a couple of friends from home and till college mates until one of my home best friends took or stole my gaming PC and peace out so ever since the beginning of 2017 I stopped having any so-called friends anyways the ones that I used to hang out with all moved out of the area most people that I can call friends where from high school till college but I am done with that since 2020 after graduating like 98% I have been alone the only people that I physically talk to it's only my parents and the rest just couple of strangers that play online games with from the web and no I am not interested getting a new friend of getting a girlfriend I am fine the way that I am it doesn't bother me anyways I was born alone in this world and I have been always been alone since I was a toddler I don't need to have friends I don't have to worry about what will other people say or think or try to change the way I am to blend in or whatever. and not getting a girlfriend helps because I don't have to worry about explaining to myself what I was doing where and at what time or worry about not getting enough attention anyways these modern girlfriends and boyfriend relationships don't last that long after months worth of dating these girls will get bored of you and hope on another man's meat. I have noticed that friendships of today are that people just talk to you when they are bored they are always willing to hang out when they want something from you some see you as a living breathing bank account so yeah so far so good with being alonevictory_hand
1,This video is really wholesome. It just makes me appreciate my friends even more!!
1,"""friends"" have mentally damaged me to the point where i just want to be alone the rest of my life, will probably just end my life in a few years to be honest"
1,"OMG , the timing of this video! I am going through a similar situation and your advice is so complete and reassuring. THANK YOU"
1,You got this one right
1,I think loneliness can be one of our greatest modern strengths.  Our loneliness comes from one of our deepest fears that without people we will die….because for most of history that was true.  People need more productive hobbies more than friends and…..productive hobbies can actually lead to friends.
1,youtube recommending this to me is a whole personal attackskull
1,me watching this literally just after getting a group of friends: *I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you*
2,Finally I can make actual friends
1,"The fact that this is currently trending really says a lot about the internet’s general audience. I’m with you, dudes!"
1,"I don't really have issues making friends. But I love each and every video of Kurzgesagt.
This reminds me of my recent birthday party where I invited someone I've not seen for years.

While someone else acquainted to this guy asks me what made him come over. 
I just told him ""I just asked him personally"", instead of just clicking on the ""invite"" button on my facebook event. 

It's not so difficult really. Time is indeed the key word."
1,"Great video as always, and a topic that doesn’t get enough attention too. Thanks guys!"
1,It's not that easy. LOL. I'm not in control of my life. grinning_face_with_sweat
1,Anyone simply looking to talk say hi! I relate very deeply to this video. If you do aswell tell me all about it <33
1,Excellent subject for discussion ! Especially now times!
1,"I'll make do with chip, penny, and napkin"
1,"that's right, a 20 million subscriber channel just called you lonely."
2,I have friends. YouTube is big stoopid
2,Damn the timing. Perfect
1,"I'm confused, I'm an introvert who loves spicy food..."
1," isn't ""global pandemic"" a pleonasm?
It just sounds wrong to me."
1," I was always the quiet kid in college and really did not go much in parties etc.

Till one day I was half kidnapped  by my classmates and got thrown to town to a party. It was amazing time haha."
1,"I might feel lonely but I actually prefer the quietness so they both kinda cancel each other out, being able to talk to close online friends and one or two best friends in real life is all I need to survive as long as possible so perhaps I'm not lonely just sleepy and so are you after reading this so you should turn your screen off"
2,Loved this!
1,"""That's why it's so easy to form new friendships in school and university."" - Yeah, no."
1,"Is this gonna be another existential crisis video kurzgesagt?? 
(7/9/2022  pm home Wednesday)"
2,i love this music so much. there is something special with it
1,"I have became more closed off during the pandemic, so I have been lonely, even though I have friends"
1,POV: You don’t go to school and so couldn’t make new friends with this advice.
2,I wish i had friends i can never find friends :( nobody care boug me i jus want friend s fr tho im 16
1,"Whoa, lately I have been feeling horrible about my social life and this comes up. Huh weird world"
1,"Often I assume that people want to be left alone. If they aren't reaching out to me it must mean they aren't interested in me reaching out to them. I mean it takes two to tango, why do I have to make the first move every single time? If they aren't putting in the effort to get to know me then I'm not going to put in the effort to get to know them. Also joining clubs, volunteering, and stuff like that just creates commitments when I want more free time, not less. Plus I like spending time alone, I like the freedom to do what I want without judgement or criticism. Sometimes I feel like I have to defend myself around others, I have to justify my lifestyle, fend off criticism of my music taste, explain why I like things a certain way, why do I wear this, why I do this, why I do that, why don't I do this, why don't I do that, etc... I guess I want to avoid judgement, I don't want to change myself to cater to other people's sense of normalcy.

Don't get me wrong, I don't hate people and I have a few friends but I'm just explaining why I probably don't put in as much effort as I should."
1,"This video is just always going to be relevant for me, but currently traveling, I’d love to see a video in a similar vein about dealing with loneliness and feeling isolated/out of place when visiting another country (or just different region/culture). Sometimes it feels impossible when how you’re used to connecting with people doesn’t work and you realize you’re playing a completely different game with the wrong instruction manual."
1,Finally some much needed life advice
2,Fun fact: people like this are called gamers
2,it seems to me that most of the people I interact with have their own friends and are not keenly interested in making new friends. It is hard to break into a group that have been friends for a long time.
2,Wow thanks YouTube
1,Hahaha how fitting! My therapist said today that my lack of social connections is the reason for my depression. And said that I needed to learn how to make friends... thx kurzgesagt! I was not really looking forwards to google all this.
1,"Oh, great! My daily dose of social anxiety is here"
1,"now do one on psychpaths. Because there are plenty of people out there that will be like, ""if you were really my friend, you would do x,y,z."" Not everyone knows how to identify a psychopath."
2,"thank you. made me cry, but, i needed it, thank you. very helpful, it explains a lot."
1,I watched the entire video and I still don't know the name and the address of my soul mate..
1,What a touching video.
2,"Best kind science there is , friendship"
2,I’m going to share this video to all of my friends
1,"Anyone who likes fairy grunge style, thrifting , live in sweden 13 and upskullred_heart"
1,This video literally is my favorite video from now on
1,Did kurzgesagt just day vibeface_with_tears_of_joy
1,"The thing is, it isn't really that hard to find someone to spend casual time with. A much harder thing is finding someone who actually wants to *know* you and be *known* by you. Intimacy is so much harder to establish than companionship. At the end of the day, if I can't be myself around someone and believe that they're being genuine with me, I'd much rather be alone."
1,Here comes kurzgesagt with yet another amazing video
1,The information and advice I really needed. I would like this video a 100 times if I could!
1,Something tells me this will be the most viewed kurzgesagt episode ever.
1,As always a beautiful video. Just what I needed this week.
2,This was nice thumbs_up
1,red_heartred_heartred_heartred_heart
2,The most perfect video for people with depression and schizophrenia
1,"Just when i was having a very heartfull conversation with my friend about how alone and empty i am feeling this man posted

I think not!!!"
2,This was so nice. Thank you!
1,The animation is really beautiful.
2,"Being alone is a privilege, enjoy it"
1,"The magic of this channel is not only explain a super complex matter as simple, but do it so accurately. Bravo. This video could do more good for humanity than all ongs together."
0,"I’m a doomer ,also numb and dumb how can i make friends"
2,"Loneliness is can be desirable at times,
but can an interesting book or novel replace a ""real"" friend?"
1,Remember when you used to make scientific content? Good times. Unsubscribed
2,Interesting title.
2,What if I found it hard to make friends at school?
2,This is perfect thx

1,"Kurzgesagt on point as always. Lots of loneliness in this comment section, and it’s never been more of a challenge to make friends. People have become so tribal lately. I’m counting on Gen Z to give up their phones and break through with new concepts of in person socializing, a millennial geezer boomer like myself needs some good ideas winking_face_with_tongue"

1,"The longer you live and see how dumb the average person is, then being alone is quite easy."
1," It seems like the current batches of schoolchildren might not be the best population sample for conducting analysis of friends. What i see is the seemingly primary use by these kids of technology, especially video games, as a substitute for making friends. This isn't knocking video games; I've played my fair share. But I never considered the people with whom I connected and played online to be ""friends"" in the traditional sense of the word. And this, to me, seems to be a root of the problem."
1,"I feel I should add: it's okay to be an introvert and it gets easier. Do and follow what you enjoy first and foremost and don't feel bad about it: it's YOUR LIFE, not anyone else's. We don't need many friends and the good ones will understand you."
1,THIS IS EXTREMELY MISLEADING AND INCORECT
2,"After my divorce, I have just accepted that everyone leaves eventually. People quote that it is better to love people than none at all but the heartbreak I felt and loneliness makes me wish I never felt any feelings at all"

1,This is one of the most wholesome videos I've seen. Thank you for putting this out there. Great advice.
2,oh my god thanks I was really lonely and I don't have friends at all and now I can make a lot of friends thank you so much you are so helpful I am very glad you posted this videosparkling_heartsparkling_heart
1,"When you're the only one putting into a friendship, it's tough to sustain. 
Way to really spin in the marketing at the end. I know you have to support the channel, but ""buy our merch to gift your friends"" really undermines the rest of the video for me."
1,"There are a lot of people I truly enjoy the company of, admire, love but the thought of friends now makes me seize up. I am happy by myself, If I woke up tomorrow and every human on earth had gone to mars, i'd be even happier. I wish we'd stop pushing this narrative of other people make you happy, especially notions like women will be unfulfilled if they don't have kids or that a romantic relationship has been deemed to have more value than how some people feel about their favourite song or film, a teacher, a pet, a book. Loneliness is the best thing that ever happened to me, I feel so much potential and freedom in it. I absolutely don't want to make another friend so long as I live."
1,"i really feel this. like i do genuinely enjoy me time and being alone but i don't want to be lonely, ya know?"
1,"Bruh, I live in a hamlet of 100 people, most my peers moved away years ago. I stay at home to babysit my ill mother and have to drive 30 minutes to work the night shift solo in my department where I see 4-5 people on my 15 minute breaks. There is extreme lack of internet here, and meeting like minded people in my age group is difficult. Either bad apples or content with their small family/circle of friends. 
If it wasn't for a giant antenna on my house I'd have not socializing of any kind."

2,"But I have like a few friends who each have their own friend group i generelly vibe with but cant figure out how to get in and my own ""friendgroup"" was formed more through circumstance like we were the few people who dont really have other friends and I just feel like everytime I want to hang out with my few good friends they hang out with other people"

1,"one of my closest friends whom i considered to be best friends, just suddenly ghosted me and when i tried to talk or generally be around, they just physically pushed me away..."
1, A preference for more or less spicy food is not at all correlated with extroversion.  Where did you even get this from?
1,"I sent this to a friend to call them lonely, lol. The video is actually good. But friendships require everyone involved to do their part. So it doesn't really help me who is the person that reaches out and starts conversations and makes plans in all my friendships, with no effort returned."
1,"I'm 38, out of work due to poor physical AND mental health. So- Broke, stuck at home, and a mental case. Nobody wants a friend like that."

1,Oh…now I know I’m definitely being watched rn eyes
1,Kurzgesagt knows it’s audience too well
1,"Really needed to hear this, life has been a struggle as it is for many but it left me not only lonely but actually alone, now finally have been reaching out and trying to meet people but ooff the anxiety is through the roof and it's hard to let people in and trust them.

2,what a lovely video
1,"my dad's undiagnosed, untreated, severe form of ADHD broke my family apart. My brother and sister moved to USA from Canada and after that, all our friends disappeared. I tried to life a vegan lifestyle to experiment it for 5 years. I lost more friends. I looked out for my best friend's ex-fiance who was being cheated on by him, I lost more friends. I told a friend not to drink and drive, i lost more friends..
Moral of story: People are full of shyt. Donot feel bad you are lonely. Feel lucky the trash took itself out. 
I am much happy now knowing i am not hanging out with people who have negative intentions towards others."
2,"wow, this video is for anyone at the ages of 13 - 16"
1,"I don't have many friends. Honestly, I only have one close friend. The others I know and enjoy talking to, but I don't know them intimately. My best friend I technically met in 5th grade but we were at different campuses of the same school. I transferred to the other campus the next year and he and several other guys came and introduced themselves to me. I never really talked to them but I did hang out sort of near their group. The next couple years I liked them because they were the only ones in the school (I went to a private Christian school) who liked death metal. I got to know my best friend well starting in 11th grade. The next year, we decided to form a joke power metal where we recorded our vocals over different instrumentals we downloaded off YouTube. I can kind of edit audio so it was a fun activity for us to bond over. We both went to the same community college. During that time, he we both found out we were going to go to the same university to so my friend asked me if I wanted to be his roommate. Man, those two years were some of the best of my life so far. We both are not the party type so we just cultivated a cozy apartment (the university is in the mountains and our apartment had a great view). We had Bible studies where we would go grab Little Caesars and make hot tea. We'd also do streaming nights where we went through Breaking Bad and Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia. When we both were drinking age (I deadass didn't drink till I was 21), we had some fun drunk nights. We did a drinking game watching Troll 2 where we took a shot every time the dead-ass grandpa would appear. I ended that night waking up in my bathroom with a bent towel rack where my head had collided. We both live in the same town still. He's getting ready to get his Doctorate in Theology and Apolagetics and start the process of being ordained. I'm still trying to find a job I really like. We still hang out a few times a month. Having a friend, specifically one you know intimately (not in a sexual way) is so important to be happy. It's nice to feel like a unit or group and have someone you can send dank memes to. I can say I love my best friend. I know that if something were to happen to me, he would have my back no matter what."
2,I've been having a lot fight with my friend thinking that he's not interested in me anymore

1,Meh video... I can solve loneliness globally. Give me 100mil and a few years.
2,I donot know how to make friends
1,Friends don’t exist. Don’t believe that bullshit. It’s every man for themselves.
1,"I personally moved 5 times when I was a kid, 2 of those times in a different continent. And when the dust settled my family and I moved permanently when i was 13. There I was, without any friends, developing social anxiety because i stressed over everyone having friends except me. Bottom line, if you are a parent don’t do what my parents did if you want your kid to have a healthy social life"
1,I low key thought kurzgesagt was about to roast us for 13 minutes straight lol
1,Exactly what I needed at the right time. Thank you kurzgesagt
1,This is fake i got a pet dog instead
1,"As someone who has found making friends difficult, I've learned some things which might be helpful:

1. Do things you want to do even if that's by yourself. Life is to short to miss that play whose run ends next week just because you've got no-one to go with. 
2. Be proactive in organising things as you smooth the path for others to say yes. Organise the day to hike that trail, or watch that film, or be the dinner party host. 
3. Be nice. Be kind. Be positive. Daily though not relentlessly. It'll become part of your character and others will be drawn to you. 

I hope this helps someone."

1,"I don’t have any friends because of trust issues, trauma issues in the past and I lack empathy, compassion as well, I don’t feel it man_shrugging I am pure cold.I am a lone wolf…I don’t like people. I rather make a bond with animals, they’re more loyal and trustworthy than 2 faced people. Being lone wolf make you stronger than those people who have friends, that’s a fact."
1,"I've literally never heard that introverts are less likely to like spicy food. Are you sure about this? I'm an introvert and I love spicy food. face_with_tears_of_joy 

I also don't buy that friends necessarily are a huge predictor of happiness for some people. Perhaps the opposite, actually. I find myself much more emotionally stable and happy now that I don't have the ""friend"" drama I had in college (maybe I just had awful friends, idk, but I had nasty falling outs with most of them, or they moved hours away after college). I do have a spouse and we're happily married (child free) with 2 cats. Otherwise, I have coworkers, an older nextdoor neighbor who I'm on an HOA board with that I feel like is kind of a ""second mom"" (if I had an emergency I think I could contact her), and some other very loose acquaintances - that's it. I'm pretty happy that way. I've tried ""making friends"" because I felt like I ""should"" (did kickboxing, joined some knitting groups/classes, went to fantasy sci-fi conventions, even got on Bumble BFF) and I hated every minute of trying to making new friends. It was exhausting and nerve wracking just to have people flake out or not have much in common (despite the common activities). Or try to approach people who were standoffish and I honestly couldn't even tell if they were interested in continuing a conversation. I freely admit I might be ""the problem"" or have expectations that were too high. I'm not really sure if I'm interested in changing. woman_shrugging I've given up on making new friends for now."

1,"I've had so many friendships, whether meaningful or not, come and go.. Throughout these situations, when things got rough or we fought, they'd just distance themselves and leave. I thankfully have a couple friends that help me out and also invest in me the same way I invest in them. Friends like that are few and far between compared to the ones that have hurt me and left. I'm sure it's like that for many of us watching. Friendships (relationships) in general aren't perfect. Some are worth holding onto, others are not. Know who your real friends are... find out who is worth it to you. Don't assume... ask questions, offer to help out. Don't give them more than you give yourself, it'll cost. Don't let your friends be the people to hold you up, because you'll fall hard when they drop you. Walk on your own, be strong on your own. Not entirely, not perfectly, don't accept isolation and loneliness. But don't let your friends be your pillar... be your own pillar. That way, you will keep standing when they come and go."

1,"While it's nice to see you make a video about this situation, I don't think this will help me to make friends. I'm an autism guy with social anxiety who lives in a country where friendships are very debatable and controversial. While I want to make friends, my fear with a lot of people, want to be alone and scared of losing friends are one of my barriers that block me to make friends, this is why I don't have friends for over 19 years. Worse, in my country, most people are extroverted and make friends with their party at restaurants, cafés,... While people who have the same hobbies and favorites like me are very rare. Both my friends and my family always call me a weirdo and I think that's also the reason why I can't make friends. Another thing is my parents, they are very picky about my friends, when I make a friend, they will see if they are good or bad for me and you guess it, all of my friends were denied by them, and yet they keep asking me why don't you have friends. While having a subreddit for your fans to make friends is good, I highly doubt many people in my country have Reddit or even heard about it and maybe I will fail at making friends again. Maybe I should stay alone until the end of my life.

Btw my country is Vietnam"
1,"MeetUp app!!! It’s an activity app so you already have something in common! Even if you’re the most introverted person they have activities for small groups! 
I went to a few activities like language exchange or drawing glasses and then I went on one that was a hike and on the hike I met one girl with a large social circle and I legit gained so many friends and my social life got so big. One you meet one friend keep going to more activities so you have more than one social circle! I really hopes this helps someone because I had a really hard time putting myself out there and MeetUp helped a ton!!"
1,"They may not see or notice

But I'm happy for my online friends. My life is far from perfect and me myself, is far from average, but those who stick by me to help even if sometimes I may not want it to have time alone, thank ya for trying and keeping our boundaries equal  orange_heart"

1,"Kids, when you're older, you will eventually realize that having a small number of tight-knit friends is better than having too many shallow ones. Keep what you have.

And also, it says here that yes, constant energy and communication is vital to build friendships but there will be friendships that are low maintenance. You haven't talked to them for months but they still love you just as much. And there will be instances that ""friends"" will turn to acquaintances again. This is normal. Part of growing."

I understood that he was busy at first but then I realized that he just doesn't care about friendships as much as I do. I guess I just figured that we would be lifelong friends but after having have known him for 10+ years I need to move on If he clearly has moved on from me."

1,Youtube is targeting me
1,Its a lonely life but atleast I have some peace of mind well perhaps too much peace of mind that its now eating away at my lonliness.
1,"Yeah this is nice and all, until people just don't respond to your invitations. After a while it just gets tiresome. You can't control what other people do, but you can control what you do. My advice is just to not say no if the opportunity happens to come up. Go outside and touch some grass (unironically), go to the harbor and check out all the boats, throw a ball really hard in one direction, or whatever else. Live! Take control of your life."
1,Kurzgesagt is financed by Bill Gates!
1,"The problem is, sometimes people start a conversation that turns out to hurt the other person's feelings. For example, asking ""What's your job?"" is a big no-no. Or ""have you married?"". This question causes depressed & unemployed people to withdraw from the people around them."
0,pls more space and more lonelyness
1,"Bruh its taken 1/4 of a life time snd i still barely, only just barely have 2 decent acquaintances. I really dont feel like alot of people *want* new friends, they want to be happier, and friends are just another means to an end. Ive tried and maintain effort in all of those ways you say, but its ended with more and more hollow empty relationships, and all manner of parasites of human beings. Idk its just like i dont feel like people really do want friends skull"
1,"My issue comes from abandonment, in which I had mostly unengaged parents, which was life long for my father, and became a reality when my mother started dating her ex. Along with strong friends I had made back in preschool and kindergarten abandoned me and made it apparent that they simply didn't like me nor wanted to be friends anymore in the most horrible ways possible. It's made me scared to even go outside, let alone interact with anyone given i have a baked in fear of doing something wrong or going through the same thing again. To where I remain silent for the most part, and take a very long time to warm up to anyone given I would rather act like I don't exist, than interact with people. 

It's really screwy how badly people can alter your ability to want or make friends through how they act towards others. In which I want friends, I want people I can talk to about daily matters and the like, yet I am so scared due to past experiences, that I simply don't. 

So in essence to all of this, try  to be understanding and kind to others, some don't realize the impact that their actions can have on others. Which can make them feel like their simply not up to par to other people, and can make them feel like in turn their not valued at all."
1,"If we dont ask for the creation of a system with alternatives that show how much we want to show solidarity and give help to individuals who have been hurt by a crisis, then we can never proceed from this, as big corporations and so called representatives of a society will never accommodate for it.
Thank you for this video, i like the positive tune they use to move forward from crisis, but it fails to send the right message: corona created distance, true, but social distancing only hurt us mostly where we already had no alternatives and showed ABSOLUTELY NO SOLIDARITY. So the lesson anyone should learn is to show solidarity that is affected by this crisis and enforce and demand a system that provides alternatives to show solidarity as a society. Haven't we learned nothing from these past the years??? Not individuals are supposed to pay for improvements in a society, as they are required to do so solely, big corporations need to think about it, lawmakers need to make laws to ensure it, and disgustingly corrupt politicians are to wake up and fulfill their societal obligations that they were elected for."
1,Going outside is terrifying. Trying to make friends is terrifying. I have no friends and I never go outside to do anything.  Talking to strangers in real life sounds beyond terrifying. Talking to a therapist for years hasn't helped. I'm so lonely and empty feeling all the time. This video doesn't seem to help and it makes me sad.

0,Waking up lonely and this video strikes to my heart.
1,"Making and keeping meaningful friendships has been an herculean task... Having friendship and betrayal trauma, rejection sensitivity dysphoria and next to no social skills makes all of it so hard and scary enough to bring me to tears before I can even properly connect. And the most annoying thing is, my job is highly social, teaching. And I can pretend well enough most days to do my job well, but its just that, a job. Once it comes to personal connections it feels near impossible. Once it comes down to things I don't bring money/productivity into the table, if feels like I'm facing a monster. ""Why would anyone ever be interested in who I am or what I do?..."" 
I also have to constantly remind myself to ask questions and try to be interested in the person. This sounds terrible, but it's not because I don't care, its that since I was severely bullied as a kid, most of the times, by kids who used to be friends who turned mean and violent, I learned and internalized that getting close to other people is dangerous and isolated myself. And so, developed no social skills as a child. 
It's been about 5-6 years since I have felt like I had meaningful friendships, and those ended in massive trauma. Since then I have been deeply lonely and I have no idea how to stop it. I understand the advice in the video and it makes sense, I have tried things like these before. But most of the times the fear of rejection and, once I do get the chance to talk to someone casually, the perception of rejection can be so intense that I have to excuse myself to have a panic attack and cry. 
In any case, I am making real effort in trying to overcome these things. I'm going to therapy to practice social skills, I am taking medication to manage my symptoms and Im getting to know myself and what is at the root of my struggles. It just moves so slowly that sometimes I just feel like Im in a purgatory, waiting for change. So many years have passed. My circles are gone, there are no clubs in my small town, I don't drink anymore and people have forgotten about me, and coming back from this feels impossible some days.

If you made it this far, thank you for reading the rambling thoughts I tossed into the empty void of this internet universe. And if you do relate to them, I truly hope it gets better. I know how much it hurts, how it sometimes steals the air out of the lungs and how helpless one can feel to the immense fear this can cause. Whoever is reading this, if there is anyone, I extend a virtual hug to you."

1,"I just want to point out that our current society is incredibly alienating. If you’re lonely, it’s not necessarily your fault. We’ve slowly been pulled out of our various social groups and thrown online, and still have a lot of social momentum in direction. We’re not completely isolated yet, and we can still create connections, but do note that it takes much more effort to form friendships today than even 60 years ago. Our social fabric is being eroded by tech companies for profit, and the simple act of putting your phone down and making real life friends is its own little act of rebellion.

Now go set up a weekly DnD group! Or maybe join your local Smash community (it’s what I did)."

1,"It's painful to realise that I could have had many more friendships in the past. I never really noticed or I even pushed them away sometimes, but never with my intention. But I'm still young and everything can still happen. As long as people don't think that I'm lying about it, then it is worth the effort."

1,"i think about friendships all the time, like how forza h4 was good at bringing people together but then they did soo much for forza h5 that it actually drove people apart, it seems like video games in general are doing this a little.   i guess im just getting to the last stage of life where i just have to deal with everything that ive gone through and deal with how people these days love to reply to something like this only in a toxic way, whatever"
1,"My family has always moved around a lot usually every 3-5 years though now that I am getting ready to go through college we(they) have decided to settle in Oklahoma for a while while I finish schooling. I have always been the new kid so I have gotten used to being around lots of new people and environments. But after moving away from one school in particular (around 2017) I lost interest in making friends. I had to do it one too many time. As well as never having found any particular hobby or skill because I did not have friends to try them with or stayed in a location long enough to actually become interested. I have never been interested in social media like Facebook instagram or tiktok nor had really any technology like phone growing up in fact I did not get a ps3 till 2016 or a PS4 till 2019 so I have not played almost any multiplayer games (spent 3days downloading fortnite just for it to ""die"" the same week but i switched to apex). I am told college will be different and that I will find lifelong friends there but they can come to me this time and I doubt they will last. Most people my age are only interested in the the three D's drugs,drama and dumb shit. and I find people a few years younger are more fun. I feel like I am about  as alone as one person could be. family wise my brothers are 10 years my senior so it's hard to relate and bond with them and aside from my parents I'm really only close to a few cousins but things change and so will my social life so...idk neutral_face"

I learnt something bizarre about myself in those years of isolation, I have very little need for social interaction, and I never get cooped up.

And even so, there is value in talking to others, so much knowledge to discuss, and so much to chit chat about!
Time never stops, and to make the most of it, I have chosen to give and take. In time, things will change, but I promised to live without regrets.

So far, it's been good. smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes"

1,I lived a very sheltered life during my childhood. My parents did not want me to go outside and hang out with my friends unless it's at school or my house. I had to sneak out a few times just to meet up with them. I couldn't go to outings and birthday parties. Then the invites stopped and I found myself alone most of the last two years of my high school. Same thing when I was at uni and  still living with my parents. I still couldn't go out so I spent my years alone in the library until I stopped going to my lectures and classes but did them online. That sucked. I still struggle socially now but over time my fiance's friends also became my friends.
1,Very good video for right now. Life has gotten in the way of so many friendships and it's hard to remember to make time for making new friends. It's a very hard thing. The affect of friendships on mental health is something I never imagined until I got here. Thanks for the video

1,"what's the point of forcing oneself to listen to racist rants and genocide cheering from people from which you get nothing in return 

if it requires ""work"" that's not friendship that's toxic. you feel exactly as lonely and bad but also you have to work as free clown for someone you absolutely have no natural care or respect for"

1," man, whats with that mouth"
1,My town is notorious for being a place that is really hard to make friends. People just do their own thing for the most part and don’t want to expand their friend groups. There was one gal I kept seeing at a place and we always talked when we saw each other. She was upfront that she didn’t want more than that which the honesty I appreciated. Other than that it’s tough. People flake a lot and it’s disheartening.
1,Why is this recommended to me . What is the algorithm trying to tell me .
2,"Making decision to make quality type of friends who are particularly keen on acquiring knowledge with good humour & sense of fun, it’s probably the best & succesful decision that I have ever made. I have always been interested in making friends to get engaged in myself with them in order to ensure my happiness dopamine. I highly recommended you guys, please don't be afraid or scared to make friends in your life whether you introvert or extrovert. A good friend accompanies play a pivotal role to make your life more healthier, happier & wiser. Don't miss this opportunity."
1,"Now, while I am very introverted I am usually the person within my 'friend' group to organize game nights and movie nights, I invite them to my house I make them food etc. But I never get invited to their homes, or for a little game or anything. I just suddenly hear that my 'friends' which I have been playing DnD with (me as the DM), are in a different group together and play without me.
I asked them once if I am annoying or if there is anything wrong about me, but they couldnt answer. So why is it that I never get invited to anything? I really want to cherish the friendship, but it just feels so one sided with all of them."

But as it turned out, being a bit more persistent with googling for stuff than just surface level, I found a few irl groups/meetups for things I'm interested in.

1,"If you depend on other people to be happy, you will never be happy. Follow your bliss, and have passion about what you do. People will find you. Sometimes you get lonely after you get rid of losers in your  life. Be patient, it is like a wound and it will heal."

2,zero friends. only mates.
2,This may help me
1,My friends make plans in front of me and dont invite me.
1,"The thing is, people don't want to have close friends, they want someone to tell things they want to hear, they don't want to put effort into trying your hobbies, they don't want to try new things with you because they all comfortable with what they have, there is also prejudgement, being gay, trans, black, asian, man, woman, tall, smaller and even being straight is a reason not to be friends with someons as crazy and stupid it sounds. They don't want to put effort into a new relationship, you can do your best to threat people properly and with kidness but they won't do the same for you if they feel your different. In fewer words you need to stop being egoist to have friends, but no one wants to put the effort to go through ""hardships"" to for a bond."

1,People are shallow and often those like myself are lonely simply because we're ugly and undesirable. It's a fact that better looking people get more friends. Plus being in your 30s makes it 10x harder.

1,"I have made friends but they are in a different country. Because for some reason I’ve become more alienated from the people from my own country and feel better connections with people from other places, because when Im around people from here, I feel completely different. But in a video game theres that distance and all they can hear is my wit and humor. 
It would be great if we could meet in person some day, just to really solidify and deepen that friendship. Because some times it does feel like it wasn’t ”as real” as this video for example shows in many ways."
1,At some point in your timeline you just shrug it off and accept that maybe some of us are meant for a lone-wolf type of life. I certainly enjoy my solitude

1,The local meetup happened last Saturday and it was tons of fun. We're going to meet up again. Thanks for bringing us together.
1,"Social Media has isolated People more than brining them closer. A lot of People are glued to their smartphones when out in public, they don't know how to hold a conversation, nor how to talk to the strangers they may be sitting next to on a Bus, or a Train. 
Social skill has been completely destroyed by Social Media, TikTok, and the instant gratification that is all around us."
1,has anybody else tried apps to make friends? it doesnt work for me
1,remember when they used to post science stuff and not preachy guru shit?
1,"Well, hours after this was posted, I lost a friend.
Or rather, a person I considered a friend cast me out.
So, thanks for giving me a few tips to fill in a blank, Kurz. It'll come in handy!"
1,"The biggest problem for me in dealing with loneliness is how trapped you can feel. The way out is so obvious, but it can feel just impossible. Especially for someone like me, who was a social outcast as a child, trying to reach out to new people is like reaching into an oven, not knowing if it's on, and wanting to grab a cast iron pan. When you've been burned a thousand times, you become increasingly wary of the next one also burning you. And then there's the problem of being introverted to the point where you assume that if people want to talk to you, they'll be the one to start a conversation. But if everyone involved has that attitude, the relationship dies. Don't be afraid. Reach out, even just to let people know you're still there. Even when it seems like you're all in a doldrum and every day is the same as the last, at least you'll have the comfort of going through it together."

1,"Yes but where do you make friends? People talk about how to be a good friend or kindle a relationship but now where to start. How does someone go from 0 friends to 2 or 3, especially when you work alot and the people you work with want to drink or they don't share your values."

1,"Just in time for school! i love you so much Kurzgesagt, this video is amazing"
1,"I really don't see the point in ""making friends"" when we live in the most selfish and sinister-motived generation of our lifetime. Where people care more about using you and talking behind your back than anything else. That's why I stopped bothering."
2,"Thank you for this. My wife just left me just over a week ago. I never knew the world could feel so lonely. Thankfully I had an amazing support group of friends, and family who have helped me through it."

1,Peak has posted again day good
1,"The deepening of ideological-political beliefs (more than the religious ones that once were the leading ones) are one of the friendship killers in the last years. The “agree to disagree” has turned into a variation of “can’t be friend with a fanatic or bigot of dimwit” (those words just meaning that you feel that you profoundly disagree with their ideas). And related, the seclusion or rejection of possible friendships based on those beliefs. As we consume social media and it’s easier to dwell on artificially created echo chambers, our ability to tolerate (and listen) to different views has weakened. Also Internet and social media provides whatever that anyone needs to get entrenched on their own points of views, however rare or crazy or extreme they might be."

1,Wow this is quite topical for the point I’m at in my life. Depression has made it veryyy hard to reconnect with my friends after being away from them for so long. I essentially have no more friends and am stuck inside all the time. I hope I can once again create new bonds thanks to therapy and personally making an effort to find resources like this vid to push me in the right direction.
1,"if you want to meet new people and make friends, just hop in a discord vc .-."

2,Thanks to this guy who understands me but I can say it's Instagram were the hard time and some people like me having hard time like real hard time to get friends some people that who got famous over in 7 years or 6 years they have enough friends but mine is over to 3 years like 2019 while I joined in 2019 but it's like I may need the same 3 years so some people and I can made everything to be good and cool
2,"I used to have a looooooooot of friends, now I'm 37 and I now have like 5 good friends and a lot of acquaintances :3"
1,"Loneliness sucks, im crying because the only 2 people I talk to are my cousins and they’re busy with school (I am too but I manage my time well.) , nobody has the same interests as me and find me rather childish, and I’m too scared to approach anyone to talk to because people seem to hate sitting anywhere near me or even sit with me in a class group, I usually do everything alone and it sucks."
1,"As an introvert with social anxiety who's also on disability (so no job environment), trying to find a friend seems as unlikely as winning the lottery. Been without a friend for over 10 years now. It's rough sometimes."

1,I INSTA CLICKED WHEN I SAW HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS
2,Love the parliement reference!
1,I tend to keep a small circle of friends
1,"I have a few friends, one in a different state, one who has a busy schedule, and one quite away."
1,"I had a situation this past week, and I texted my friend that I would go to his event with a friend I haven't seen in quite some time. Long story short the friend I was supposed to go with wound up hitting me up last minute that they were feeling pretty exhausted from the past week and so I wound up not going to the friends event because one: the event was pretty far but I was willing to make the trip contingent on if my friend pulled up, two: the weather was shit and the event was very far, the trains were fucked and I didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of then having to find a way back home and three: I just felt an overwhelming sense of why should I even bother going all the way out to see someone who i'm not sure would pull up to see me if I had an event. I realized this was all my ego and I probably should've went anyways just so that I didn't have to be home, and to at least support someone I care about and potentially make some new friends out of it, but I felt too sad and miserable to go and also events from earlier this week I think had me feeling pretty down. So I just say this to say I guess that I know that it's easy to get down sometimes and let our ego take control of our thinking, but sometimes I've realized in order to make friends and build connection we have to be willing to put that aside and that feeling a tad bit nervous and uncomfortable is necessary, and that vulnerability is super important in this process too."
1,"Havent had a friend in 2 years, sometimes it gets hard dude but overrall i guess im fine"
1,I literally want to disappear I want to exist in nothing life is cool but it's not even worth it tbh working all day five days a week isn't a life it's so miserable thinking about how accepted it is to work till you die

1,Duck is everywhere
1,"It's long been my opinion that spacetime is the fabric of reality, but more importantly, friendships"

High school was bad but my one hope of a blank slate in Uni is now gone. I don’t know what I’ll do after this, if I don’t make friends here it feels like I’ve wasted my youth and my regret & guilt will be immense. Loneliness and the way it occurs is so complex yet so simple. But its something we can’t ignore however hard we try, and i wish i could live without social interaction but i cant."
1,"I can't relate. Like, i don't have friends, at least not close ones and that aren't part of my family, but i still don't feel lonely at all, I'm fine on my own."

1,"Just the right video for me. Was in a big friend group and in relationship. Then I moved country and ended up connected to few friends and distant relationship. Then we broke up and connections fade away because I had to prioritize work/searching for home and learning a new language. And now for last 8 years I'm just depressed, and with no friends nor relationships."
1,"basically you're saying that working 9 hours a day from monday to saturday in modern socialist disguised as capitalism society is the problem. if socialism were to be abolished (taxation and privileges) people would earn more and then could work less thus having more free time. 

how can we work less and have more free time ? what about a video about tax evasion, no consumerism, being self suficient at home, like generating your own electricity and eating what you plant, is that even possible ? I know governments don't like self suficient people because they can't tax what people produce at home, but is it the only way to have more free time ? how can we solve this issue ?

The boomer generation, didn't have to work as hard and could acumulate much more whealth than us despite having a lower standard of living. Why is that ? Is it because socialist ideologies implemented through taxation made workers earn less, work more and politicians used that tax money to keep a few selected friends of the king privileged so they don't need to work and can keep living on other people's stolen tax money ?

Why germany is so socialist nowdays to the point it taxes 50% of its citizens income? How can you work less if the government solution is to increase regulations for companies undermining people's freedom, reducing the job offers and keeping everyone as a slave, from coorporations and from the state?

What is the solution to work less and have more free time so I can give more attention to the friends and people I love?"

1,thank you for making this video.. its incredible how collectively we all know and understand these things but it takes someone saying it in such outward blunt and plain terms for us to really get it.
2,Nah im good. Who needs friends amirite?

1,"I think that Kurzgesagt is the most wonderful page on youtube. Each video makes me feel peaceful and I really love that! 
Hugs to you all"
1,Wow. This time you managed to depress me before even clicking on the video.
1,"Listen guys. If you struggle to make friends you just need to realize that the only thing holding you back is you. For some reason 
our brains are pre-programed with some kind of filter for what to say and what to not say. 

Now acknowlege that filter and throw it in the trash. Because the easiest way to make friends is to talt to that person and say literraly anything. 

There is good chance that you are a normal human so there is high probability you won’t 
say anything creepy or weird. The rule of the thum is to say state something funny or ask a question and explaining it afterwards why you asked in the first place. 


And even if you didn’t catch ones interest or maybe even made fool/creep/you name it out of you there is no need to scar yourself with that menory. You won’t ever see that person in your lifetime. And providing it wasn’t some next level shit you told him he will rememer you for couple of hour tops - probably forgetting everyhing abou you in matter of munites. 

That’s the way i met most of my friends aaaand that’s also the way i met my girlfriend. Don’t worry, dump the filter and use your head a bit and you won’t be lonely ever again."
1,This video is beautifully made! I’m sure many people can relate and find comfort in this! Thank you so much for your work!
2,Thank you reccomendations. Very cool!
1,"The last 2 times we had to go into groups of 2 because of an art project i didn’t have a partner. The first time i was kinda hurt but brushed it off because i was busy doing other things. But the second time it happend i was devastated. My heart pounded and i felt the tears building up. This made me realize how lonely i am and that i need to make actual friends. I talk to people on surface level but i don‘t have actual friends with whom i could spend my free time with. I guess i‘ll have to start actually sticking to people and nudge them into spending time with me. If what this channel says is true and the more time you spend, the more close you become, i will try my best. Thank you for this video.folded_handssparkling_heart"
1,"I have been switching city 4 times (I wentback to my childhood city at the end) and I have lost contact with my friends also because I was smoking too much W and it was making me less and less social. I also used other drugz. I regret meeting the wrong peoples in my life and losing contact with my real friends :(

 I « woke up » like 2 years ago, maybe a bit more and I want to get a social life again 

Im now 22 since a few days and my birthday was only with my parents. Still good you’re gonna say aha.

I don’t even know why Im writing this but anyway"
1,"Wow, this video was recommended to me precisely when I need it, as I was overwhelmed with loneliness today, when I realized that I had nothing to do but to drive home after a busy day of college ended. I had always placed an unbalance importance on school and books over social life, while I distracted myself with games and videos when resting. It was not until today that I realized how unhappy I was in college, and how many friends I've lost touch. Thank you Kurzgesagt."

1,How to get a girlfriend?
2,A little wrong? I am super introvert but love super spicy food
1,"Bring somebody who has is / has been lonely for such a long time, and has seen the lowest it can take you and cause you real pain, to bring more appreciative of life, I used to blame others for hurting me with their isolation.
Now I don't, and I realise it's not my fault, nor theirs, just that I haven't been trying in the right places.
Its okay to be alone, but not okay to be lonely and I wish people would understand that difference and wouldn't wish this pain on my worst enemy."
1,"It's a lot of work to make friends, most of the people I meet I don't want to be friends with and the idea of hanging out with them feels weird. You could say I am not comfortable with these feelings and I have to overcome it but damn,  if I can get by with talking to family once every few weeks I am fine with not meeting anyone new. Maybe I have a pessimistic on going to create new friends, but this is how it has gone for me.  At the end of the day it may be worth it to get out and meet new people but I'd rather chill at home doing what I like and love than trying to meet new people that I may not like and taking my me time away."
1,"you forgot to mention you must first demonstrate higher value. people wont connect with someone they feel wont contribute to their life. think about it, who befriends homeless and old people. thats why its hard to make friends"
1,"I just experienced the last straw with my ""friend"". I was clinging onto the friendship because I did not want to be associated as a loner. (She was my only friend). But now I'm content with being alone."
1,"as an autistic person, how can i bring myself to care about other people's conversations? It's not that I am an asshole I simply am too focused on my own life and interests to think about anyone else's and clearly people don't like that. Ppl come and talk to me about their lives, I don't ask questions and they think it's because I don't wanna talk to them, but the truth is, I have no idea what to say 9 out of 10 times, because I have no interest in what team won the game or shit like that. Either that, or what I want to say is not socially acceptable so I just go like ""cool story bro"". IDK maybe I am a self absorbed asshole or people are just generally uninteresting and bad at making conversation. When it is topics I am interested in, you will not make me stfu lmao. HALP"
1,My guy litrally assumed ur lonely and its right too
0,Alternative title : why u suck
0,Why was I so unreasonably offended by the title?
1,I saw this right after I told my dad I had no freinds
1,I have seen in the comments that this is a very heartfelt episode however when I first saw the title I honestly thought this was one of those meme ones
1,why you need to be able to function on your lonely before affecting people's lives you care about ;)
2,"I’m too ugly and neurodivergent to make friends, but I wish the best for everybody else."
1,Hey can you make a video on the African cheetahs introduced to india and they are bad and good for Indian species and ecosystems
1,Surely all information in this video is right Clueless
1,I have friends in my life but I am dealing with generalized anxiety disorder.
1,"I just started my 4th year at uni (gonna graduate 2 years later) and I feel like its harder to build relationships with people in class. I feel like I don't always have a good reason to talk to approach other people and the thought of having to think of some excuse to approach others feels fake to me. Being really bad at reigcognizing faces does not help either.

I also feel like I have high standards to myself when I feel competitive (and sometimes project it to other people), this also makes me less approachable as well (I have ruined like 3 teams that Im in in 1.5 years of Apex legends). 

Other then my weaknesses, my greatest concern about finding friends is that I don't want to make friends just for the sake of it, I really value genuinity of the relations I build and it feels fake to me

This video inspires me to think about how I should approach relationships with other people and its nessesity and I am going to try making some friends"
1,Social anxiety is one of my bigest problems to make friends or start a relationship. The friends I do have often don't know this. Getting a girlfriend is the hardest part in life for me right now
1,Is there a way you can make a video about ptsd!
0,OMFG THIS IS DEPRESSING!!! IF U NEED A VIDEO TO TEACH U HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS N WAT TO DO WIT FRIENDS JUST SHOWS HOW SHIT THE WORLD IS NOW!! HUMAN RACE IS SO DOOMED!! SMH!! SO GOD DAMN SAD!!
2,He’s knows his audience too well lol
2,Does my dog count as a friend?
1,Naur but what if you've had so many incredible friendships and you ruined all of them because you're a terrible and unstable person
1,"There is a difference between being lonely and being alone. I live in rural Australia and I am happy just to see the locals at the pub on a Friday night but for the rest of the week I'm fine. I grew up in the city hand had a huge social group though the car scene but now I would say I only have 2 best friends. What you say is true, I am happy with a smaller group that im older now than a huge social circle. I ended up moving to Germany for 2 years and made a awesome group of friend through online gaming (Planetside 2) and we had meetups occasionally that have left me with distant friends for a lifetime even if we hardly have contact.

I treat people the way I wish to be treated and I leave my door open to anyone, Even if it is friends I haven't seen in 8 years. Just be cool and open and a bit of liquid confidence helps as well

1,"You have no idea how much I neded this, just stared at a new school and have no curent friends their. This gave me a power boost to go out their and talk to people, thank you"
0,"Yeah, I don't care about having friends, I do my on thing, tired of being backstabbed."
2,"""Less popular than average""

No matter how many friends I lose, I will still be popular and I think you know whyface_with_tears_of_joy"
1,"My current friend group started in 2004 when I started a job fully intent on only being there until I found a good job.  I went in set to avoid building any relationships or getting to know anyone.  Now, 18 years later, this group of people have been my friends longer than any friend I ever had prior.  Sure, I still see people on facebook that I've known since the 80's, and we might even occasionally exchange messages, but I don't really consider them friends since we only ever interact once or twice every couple of years.

I'll be interested to see, in another 20 years, how people growing up and never NOT having the social aspects of the internet making the world a smaller place feel about friendships.  Will people for the most part end up with more ""life long"" friendships, or will it remain mostly where it's at.  I know how it's affected my friendships, but I spent almost half my life without the world shrinking power of the internet."
1,"I commute to school and i never hang out with friends. but i don’t feel lonely at all. i know that I don’t need “friends” to help me eat, sleep, etc. I love talking to people and I’m in nursing school. but making friends is the least of my worries. there’s billions of people in the world. don’t worry about not making friends loudly_crying_face you will get friends. be patient"
1,2.7M views in 2 days? There's a damn lot people who don't have enough friends..
1,Needed this :(
2,The only friend you need is yourself. People will disappoint you
1,"I’m one of very few in my age group still in my little town. My friendships have all split since everyone moved away for school. It’s also difficult since I am much younger than all of my colleagues. I can’t seem to connect with the people there, or at my choir, since everyone has kids and completely different lives to me."
0,"Mo people mo problems
I was born with enough problems"
1,"The best way to connect with new people is by travelling! I’ve been to Greece, as my first solo travel ever! While being in my comfort zone for years, I decided to just go. And met alot of new people, from UK to Australia. As being a ambivert, I had some time to recharge myself by being alone of course. But I had zero issues when asking for plans. We went to the beach together, ate some dinner. And met some other guys girls by doing so as well! I would say just do it, before you might regret it!"
1,"finally, a tutorial"
1,Yeah but I have social anxiety pensive_face
1, i fell over. Was not expecting to be called out like that. *stares at my 2 year old half painted Carcharodon*
2,I think am better without friends

2,Could not have asked for a better video to watch today. Thank you.
1,i just got into a new school and it hurts because i have made no new friends since 2 weeks in i have made no progress and is really awkward to start a conversation. Thank god i found this videored_heart
2,all my friends sent me this w no context

1,"can't wrap my head around how you manage to put out stuff that seems obvious but make it a lesson worth learning nevertheless!
And please stop adding the music that makes me cry almost every time..."
2,"If this vid inspired u to talk to a friend
Like"
1,"Thank you for making this video, I think a lot of people need to see this... the world has slowly become a disconnected place"
1,"Alright chill kurzgesagt, I get it I'll go touch some grass lol."
1,"Feeling truly alone is also linked to high intelligence as well & im not just talking bout genius book smart Im referring all the myriad forms of intelligence such as artistic intelligence, emotional intelligence etc. The feeling of being alone will be beyond just feeling like nobody likes you or gets you but more of the feeling & understanding that nobody you’ve met is able to perceive reality anywhere close to how you do & you feel like you’re beyond normal human comprehension(not in a cocky or vain aspect) which further separates you from everyone family, friends & strangers"
1,this video was what I needed just a week before school starts thanks Kurzgesagt
1,"I'm sorry kurz, but this video confirmed what I had always believed - that the phrase ""social circle"" is wholly inaccurate. Friend groups are like trees - where you're either the hyper-extrovert that makes up the trunk, or you're just one branch. If the trunk dies, you go with it. I have been friendless for almost a decade, life is miserable to be sure, but I don't believe that it would be any better inside a ""social circle"".  There is no such thing as ""friendships"", only ""centralized hierarchy of people who can tolerate one another"". I chose to exclude myself from a system so toxic."
1,"I've been getting into video essays a lot over the past couple years. Lately one topic I've been seeing is the manosphere and the toxicity that comes with it (all of it is toxic). And I'm reminded by some of the takeaways from those videos is that we need more content like this across youtube. Not to oversimplify the matter but, A lot of boys and men who feel this kind of loneliness or disenfranchisement get sucked into this trap because they don't know how to interact with the world around them. And I like to think that this video can be a real good outline on how to pull people out of these spaces before it's too late. Well done Kurzgesagt"
1,"Never have a friend 
But it seems amazing"
1,I met my wife on a depression chat...  made a video for parents when we visited an Aquarium In Atlanta... Im pending for a green card xd
0,This hits hard
1,"while i really appreciate you guys making this video for people who actually are suffering from this kind of stuff, for me making friends isnt much of a requirement for me. i have one irl friend and socializing isnt much a problem either since i talk to people on discord about hobbies and stuff. even when i was in school when covid was still around, my parents made me go back to school irl. sure it was a bummer to have no one to talk to not even my one irl friend cause he stayed online but then id go home and id just hop on discord and get in on a discussion, even if me and my one irl friend parted our own ways i still woudnt be bothered by it and would just probably forget about it and focus on my goals in life. so for me not having any friends is ok, if i actually thoughtlessly do end up making friends along the way then cool, great thats a bonus"
1,"School is trying to make you not want to do extra curriculars, or have friends. School takes so much of my time, that I don't want to spend any more time there than I have to. You also can't make friends in class because teachers are always, ""No talking! (Even when we're doing literally nothing)"""
1,"Can't wait for the Kurzgesagt debunked videos that's : ""um actually friends are pointless we should all be alone because alone is the best"""
1,"My 12th, most important, enjoyable and last class of our school is destroyed because of this pandemic.
Now I will destroy you China, you will be on your knees in recent years enraged_face
There was no purpose of my life before 12th but now I have."
2,"Okay here I go with a sure fire way to make friends. Ahem...




*BIONICLE*"
1,this has been pretty helpful because i just moved into my dorm at a boarding school and i only knew one other person who was going to the same boarding school. It is reassuring to know that friendships take time to form because i was scared that I may not make any friends during the school year.
1,as someone who is a college fresher in his first year...thanks a ton for this video!smiling_face_with_smiling_eyessmiling_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,Never inew you could make the topic of friends si depressing and existensial
1,I guess it's time to reach out
2,"me checking my friends list:

my friends list."
2,Been playing 40K for 12 years now.  Can’t believe it was just mentioned here lol.  Nice
1,Youtube really said recommend smiling_face_with_tear
1,What is the background music playing in the video?
1,I started high school a few days ago and I feel like everyone in my class somehow already made friends and I'm just so lonely right now. And what makes it worse is that my friend already made so many new friends and now I can't even hangout with her because she has lots of other people to talk too and we're not even in the same class so I think I'll just be a bother. Of course I'm happy for her but I just feel like something is wrong with me
1,"I'm not lonely!
Isn't that right, mr. shadow?"
1," ""Being physically present in a class a lot without saying a word makes others more sympathetic to you.""

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA rolling_on_the_floor_laughingface_with_tears_of_joy

no. I can state with absolute certainty that that statement is categorically and laughably false. Keeping to yourself just makes bullies bully you harder; you present an easier target."
1,The fact this video exists has me worried for our collective social future
1,No one talks to me..
2,thank you for the video
1, that my dude is a false info
1,"Face To Face classes literally just started for us here and I haven't had anyone to talk to at school. My online friends stopped chatting with me coz they're busy. My classmates would rather hang out with others they are close to in personal. Even my bestfriend doesn't  even bother to talk to me coz i rejected his confession. I'm so lonely, I just want someone to talk to that's all i want."
1,so basically ban titkok and it's solved
2,"I feel bad for the people that are lonely not having friends, while for me I have a BFF playing with me all the time. I hope things get better for the people who are lonely , also your not alone many other people are lonely and even in hard times you can still get through this. It’s never to late to make friends and I mean it, even if your too old it is still too not late to make friends (mostly or little) people are going through the same thing. If you broke up with a friendship maybe you can try to be friends again because, it is not too late it will never me too late to make friends. So if your lonely I hope things will get better soon because YOU matter."
1,now i have to explain to my family why i was watching a kurzgesagt video about how to make friends
1,Sooo where is the video for autistic people lol

2,This is a very good video full of wisdom. hundred_points
1,how many followers of Kurzgesagt in Bosnia?
1,As someone who's become recently homeless I've never needed a video more. I look forward to watching this when I get done work.
2,Wow kurzgesagt really knows their audience lol

1,It's all we needeyes
1,The title of the video rolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughing
1,"I’ve been lonely my whole life. I can feel lonely even when I’m with people because it doesn’t feel authentic. I’ve decided it’s probably just me and I’ll have to go through this life feeling like I’m on my own. And, in the end, we all are. We come into this world alone and we’ll leave it alone. Oof. As an adult, it’s much harder than before. Many people ghost or don’t want to spend the casual time together needed to build a friendship. They don’t care, really."
1,"The most important thing is to be your own best friend. Then, you'll find more friends if you need them. If not, it's sign you are capable to be alone and feel good while creating a meaningful and creative life."
1,I had no friends through high school or college. I missed those developmental years and I am now defective. We are social creatures and life isn’t worth living without people in it. I’m gonna rope myself in a few months
1,"When I moved to the opposite side of the country for college what helped me was just being honest with people. I joined every club I was even mildly interested in, and after the meeting was over I would just walk up to people and talk to them, strike up a conversation, and just literally say that I am new here, I don't know a single person, and I really want to make friends - Do you wanna go out this weekend? - Do you wanna study at the library together? -"
1,Video title sounds like a wikihow article I looked up when I was 14
1,Finally...
1,"Thanks for this video, it’s my 4th day of College and while Classes and Clubs haven’t started. I’ve only met a few that I could maybe call a friend. And I’ve been feeling like everyone else is fitting in more than me. But this video gives me hope that there is a lot of head of me"
1,"I have a angel fish which follows me around whenever I feed her, is she classified as a friend?"
2,This was recommended I am now sadddd
1,"I complimented a female coworker on her dress. I was pulled in to HR for ‘making provocative statements & gestures’. I feel so alone. It’s impossible to make other people feel nice or grow closer to anyone.

It’s pointless anon. Give up. You will never have friends or relationships. You will grow old and die alone. Find a rope and make it quick."
2,"how to make friend:

""want to go out with me?""

""i just want to be friends""

+1 friendship"
1,"Loneliness has been my biggest struggle for years because I've been failing to connect with family and meeting new people, being ""new"" to where I am. Anyone who thinks not having friends, or at least one person to talk to, isn't such a huge problem hasn't experienced the slow, tormenting pain of being totally alone and feeling like there is no point in living. This problem of loneliness needs to be given much more attention, but few people care about an issue before it has affected them personally. completely!"
1,"My ""friends"" are anoing when they come to my door and I this is why don't like fece to face contact instead online every one has the comfort of controling how anoid can support"
1,I feel this was targeted
1,I am very aware of my introverted brain and I really hate it. And still. I can't somehow talk to people. Fk me
1,idk what youtube is telling me by putting it in my recommended
2,Anyone wants to be friends with me
2,"Interesting how this video was uploaded today, not even a day after I really ... well, hated myself for being so stupid by letting a friendship slowly die. He was like such a nice guy, but its just so hard sometimes to keep a friendship going."
1,This is the same way I make friends I don’t like big groups but I have a little circle circle of people that like spending time with me and same away around
2,I love videos like this! I’m starting to notice my friend group dwindling and it’s nice to know it’s a common theme. More self help videos would be awesome!
1,"I just kind of gave up on the idea of making friends you know? 

I've got a lot going against me anytime I meet someone because first off I'm black American, and more importantly I don't present myself as a black American because of the way I talk, my hobbies, interest and musical preferences so it's a double whammy right out of the gate when I'm talking to anyone.

If you're someone like me you just have to learn how to embrace the loneliness and accept it as part of Who You are. It's easier that way."
2,"Yeah. If you’re the only non-coupled one, good luck getting anyone to hang out with you when you suggest."
2,What if I don’t want friends?
1,so what if I tell I know why im lonely and making friend that right for my motivations is hard and what you say good for a person in a state of desperate which is itself need to be fixed by not doing those
1, me who dosent use TikTok but still doesn't socialise
1,"I think advice in the video are mostly the stuff people already know. Here is my 2 cents, gossip makes friendships stronger, use it. Common stressor makes it easier, if you have a hard ball boss, for instance, people around will be much more open for friendship."
1,"Always a loner. But I'm improving. By the age of 70 I'll find a friend, I think."
1,"Nonsense , i was born alone and im going to die alone so why even bother making friends nerd_face"

*Recommended for you*"
1,I'm handicapped no one wants to be my friend. The people who I thought were avoid me.
1,You will make it! Start little and try to expose yourself more! It will require time and effort but all good things do.
1,"I have great friends now that I never thought I'd have, but even still I can get lonely, lonely in who I am, their understanding of me eventually bottoms out when I get very ""out there"" about some things, but they care and make effort and we're all very busy and financially struggling, we all just gotta keep hanging in there, look at the good stuff the internet has done for lonliness, now there's a group or niche crowd for almost everything, we just have to be courageous and put ourselves out there"
1," The Moon TURNS THE Wrong WAY........
How could you :))"
0,Literally on my dead grandma I don't want no friends literally on my dead grandma
1,"yep, the hardest part of making friends is taking the initiatives, especially for a person like me. Yet, it really hurts to be alienated... Once a group is already established, it is more difficult for an outsider to join the circle of friends. Yes, it takes time to build a friendship, but the time needed can be shortened depending on the type of person, as well as the common experiences and situations."
2, The Most
1,Not Kurzgesagt being aware of what I've literally just searched up :)
1,Why is this recommended to me...Youtube knows loudly_crying_face
1,I don’t really need this but it has the kurzgesagt narrarator.
1,"It would be interesting to you to make a video about internet friends compared with ""real life"" friends.
Because about a year ago when I had a bad time with depression, I met a dude from another country in social media. We had so much in common and quiqly became best friends, with him I felt much more confortable talking about my life. He helped me a lot, but I also lost conection to allmy other friends (when I ended elementary, and when I changed from highschool)
We both don't have the resources to meet in real life, and his family wouln't allow him to see me.
For me the friends from social media that I never met in person, make me feel a lot more confortable, and I never in my life opened my heart as much as when talking to them."
1,I really needed this video. My entire close social friendship group abandoned me due to me going into a career they didn’t like. I still have good friends but they live hundreds of miles away. I still speak with them but don’t have the face to face interaction I used to. This gave me some motivation to try and make new friends
1," ''Introverts, often confused with shy people' - THANK YOU this bothered me a lot usually haha we ain't shy we're just not as outgoing as some others"

1,I don't have any friends but I don't feel lonely.
1,"Looked at the Australia Megathread, and Tassie isn't included. Guess I'll stay lonely."
1,"I don't know if this is good or not. I have a friend that have a bit close to me, but sometimes I shared some silly stories of mine with her,  she reacted like ""whatever"", and it's certainly always disappointed me. This happened sometimes and I don't know what should I do with this relationship. I've never felt in a standstill as same as that in a close-friend relationship."
2,Okay ouch
1,Kurzgesagt knows their audience
1,"Extroverted autistic here 

This video basically confirms everything life has taught me 

I have found a couple other tips and tricks as well 

Maybe one in three hundred of people you have a good conversation with becomes your friend. Numbers may vary, but talking to a lot of people may help 

Ask them about what kind of job they have/what they study and then what their hobbies are. Then pick the one of their answers you know the most about/feel the most comfortable talking about/is the most curious about and ask a question about that. An open question. And the conversation has started 

Also the biggest advice: don't worry. Just throw yourself out there"
1,You think my parents let me ho oustide?
1,Next time Kurzgesagt will tell us how to get a girlfriend
2,Lol why was this recommened to me in my DMs. But thanks
1,wait how did you know
1,Well I am 13 and recently I moved to high-school and here I dont have friends my only friends are from my previous school and from my private lessons what I should do also I dont like many  kids in my high school
1,"I don't need to watch the video, all I need to do is being two-faced and liar, maybe much of person telling what others want to hear. And also reborn to be handsome that when others look at me they want to be near of me. If I do these things there will be a lot of friends around me.

Gonna watch though."
1,"I'm a big fan, but I'd like to offer some constructive criticism.

I felt I had to stop watching this video halfway through. Unlike with most of their videos, I felt it was less informative.

My perception was that the narrator spent most of the video explaining the very basics of what friendship is, and then listing ""but in your case...,"" ""but for you...,"" ""not everybody does...,"" for what seemed to be a much longer time than the time spent on explaining factual information.

It seems to be common on YouTube: the presenter has an opinion, or even a fact to talk about, and they spend more time qualifying their statement by saying ""this is subjective, don't flame me"" in so many different ways, that the amount of actual content expanding on why or what they say is sparse, and comes 5 or more minutes into the video.

Yes, there are exceptions to most statements. Maybe this video was meant for children. I'm not sure. Maybe the factual statements should come first, and then one short remark about subjectivity and ""your mileage may vary."""
2,Just here for a friend
1,"there is a problem that ,often, a lot of money is necessary to keep friendships."
1,So much love face_blowing_a_kiss from kurzgesagt. Thankyou so much.
1,"I feel like nowdays its easy to get along with people bc everyone has something in common which seems to be “depression and anxiety.” Talking and making a joke about our insecurities and sadness seems to be a good ice breaker in the beginning but I’ve noticed it tends to become a battle of sympathy whenever things get more serious. As society gets more entitled, I feel what people think “friends” are today are people who will feel sorry for you when you are feeling down, and not someone who really will help you get out of it. Most people and “friends” I’ve encountered have completely shut me out when I tell them the hard truth. What they are trying to do is trying for one to pity their “condition” instead of actually doing something to improve it. Its all about attention these days and who can get more sympathy sadly."
1,"I too, am aghast at how addicted to our screens we are. It's so easy to distract ourselves than it is to do real life stuff and I don't see it getting better anytime soon. The youngest generation doesnt know how to connect outside of a cell phone which isn't good at all. We are in for a rocky future."
1,"I miss when Kurzgesagt made videos within their lane - interesting and silly science about the world - not bullshit capitalist  propaganda about making people ""work harder to be their best self"" just for the sake of continuing systems that are killing us. If Kurzgesagt can't exist without fulfilling the ulterior political goals of their funders, perhaps it should just cease to exist."
1,where was this video when i needed it?
2,I have 2 very good friends. They are all I need.
2,"Thanks for this video, I needed this."
1,Next video: Why You Are Lonely and How To Find a F*ck Buddy. Thanks!
1,man Kurzgesagt rlly be calling me out on this one. cant say they wrong tho i literally have 0 friends. Im not even joking about it either.
1,"""..although you are perfectly average""
Thanks?"
1,This video is a life changer. Im not trying to sound cringe but seriously keep it up!
0,FUCK this is a good video!
1,"Everytime i go to school , I see many people talking and having fun with their best friends which makes me feel underappreciated. It makes me feel that they have better life in their joyful islands and I have a future of sailing in the ocean of misery. I little bit talk and I have pretty much good friends but the things that holds me down from my confidence is the introversion trait of my personality. Thank you Kurzgesagt for making this video feeling myself a little bit better and preserving the gem of hope for the bright future."
1,"Man, Kurzgesagt, you almost had it in the first 2 mins of the video, and then you fall back on unfounded and inane reasoning when describing why. Yes, proximity is important, and like I said, you almost had it when describing the dynamics of a dormitory and their effects on relationship building. If I was your sociology prof, I'd be asking you to dig deeper. Why? What is it about proximity, about the environment of a dormitory or a school, etc. that encourages this sort of relationship building? After all, you can't solve a problem if you don't understand where it comes from."
1,"People with Autism are particularly susceptible, especially when they attempt many of the usual methods to attain friendships, and are summarily rejected, often without any thought at all."
1,The usage of vibe throws me off so hard
0,"Damn, making friends is so hard, especially as a teenager…weary_face"
1,What if you're introverted and also hate people?
1,"I'm 26 and basically have only one close friend left. My silly animal brain craves friendship like most other humans, but I'm uninterested in most people and need a lot of personal time alone to recharge. It's annoying and makes for a pretty boring, lonely circle of connection. I want to do better this year. This video is mostly stuff I already knew, but having it reaffirmed helps a lot. :,)"
1,"I went to a new school and everyone already has close friends so I can't get any, what should I do?"
0,I don't have many friends but I cherish the ones I have
2,watching this with my friend
1,"i am 19 and have 6 people i can call friends: a group of 4 guys i met in a videogame and 2 former classmates, the issue is that the former are hundreds of kilometers away and the latter group doesn't want to hang out.. i could write more but the gist of it is that it seems that i am the only one who wants to do stuff with my friends, i almost never get a text a La ""yo let's go to X or Y"".. 
it really drains me and now that i'm tired of suggesting stuff i am so lonely 

Idk what to do.. i am busy with university and don't like anyone there enough to spend my time with them. Cannot go do my other hobbies (too much rain to skate which is sad) and don't have any money to start another, so no dice there. These past few years have been so miserable for me :("
2,Why is this in my feed is this an insult? Thank you for the advice and all but I'm going to do none of this and blame you when I fail
2,like com'n kurzgesagt you didn't have to do me this wrong
2,"Well, what if I am not over 18?"
1,Incredibly important and well made !
1," Ive tried reaching out to a lot of old acquaitances the last year, and they mostly seem bothered or couldnt care less"
1,i literally needed this
1,The fact this is 1 trending tells us a lot about the world
1,"I don’t think this can cause diseases, right"
1,"ah yes, sociopath and it's risks that might ruin my life for having no friends or in a relationship, because believe it or not, i have never gotten into a relationship, or aqquire true friendship for the past 10 years of my life, at all (not counting family members, because in default they care for you.). Plus, I often gets a temporary friendship that usually lasts a single day to a entire months, which became meaningless because either way, no one likes a sociopathy-like person (just like me)"
0,"Nice, do one about getting bitches next"
1,"I like this channel, but it completely ignores mental health, depression and it's impact on out lives. If only life were as simple as the video."
1,"This video reinforced my belief that i don't want or need friends, online or real life. It takes too much effort to make and keep friends and i don't want to burden anyone with myself anyway. I only mess things up, make things unfun or get in peoples' way so i don't bother.

I suppose having 0 friends since 6th grade (i'm 22 now) has warped my perception but everytime i think about it deeper i realise im happier this way."
1,FOR SOME REASON THE VIDEO MADE ME CRY
1,What if literally nothing interests you in life and thus you don't have any interest in common with anyone?
1,"Thank you Kurtzgesagt team. This video has given me motivation and a push to invest more time and effort to keeping friend, reaching out to old friend and in general being more open to opportunities to create new connections. Thank you!"
0,damn is this some sort of a personal attack? i was feeling lonely.
1,This video really called me out ngl
1,"I'm 36, I deleted my Facebook almost three years ago. It was tough making friends before, but sans social media it's almost impossible. People assume there's something wrong with me for not being on social media, even if they're getting to know me in person. So, I guess that's the tradeoff, either sift through a sewer for the chance at friendship, of be a loner and avoid all the shit."
2,I have no friends since 2020.
1,"We mingled during lockdown in 7 hour gmail calls, occasionally unmuting and talking for a while"
1,"In a nutshell, put your idiot box down and talk to people."
1,"I’ve been feeling quite lonely lately, despite having a lot of people I could definitely be closer with. I really needed this video this morning, so thank you for this~"
1,200k views in 1 hour. Surely people feel more lonely than ever and I think it's going to increase only
1,not the video i deserved but the one i needed
1,"If you are lonely it might be a good time to start getting some professional counselling. There are reasons why people may be avoiding you, and it’s the right time for humility and retrospection. Blaming everyone else for your problems is what dysfunctional people do"
0,this video just made me wayyyyyyyyy more depressed
1,"Perfect time for this video to be uploaded, failed an exam today and that may cause me to fail the semester which will seperate me from the only few semblences of friends I have, I want to kms cowboy_hat_face"
2,"You're looking kind of lonely girl,"
1,Introverts generally prefer less spicy food?
1,"I would take his information and fully implement it into my everyday life but as one would say, I am a 'fence sitter'; meaning that I don't know where the hell I am going with my life. Another reason is that I am extraordinarily younger than what he assumes the viewer to be (18>)."
1,"Sigh
I guess I’m just built different
-white waman"
1,Hahaha. I quite literally disagree with the first couple of sentences with regards to my shift friends
2,what a  nice friendly video.
1,"i believe that as you grow out of your old self and start to see improvements in your life, the pace of life and the vibe you vibrate will attract better people too! ;-)  All da best everybodi"
1,since when did kurzgesagt become a psychology channel?
1,I had to find this out the hard way. After being introverted and secluding myself for 19 years I've forced myself to be extroverted. The effect of that being I'm incredibly happy I have a great job I love and overall my mental health has had leaps in the right direction. The best advice I can give is force yourself to meet new people and to just talk to others even if you don't talk again.
2,"I’m so glad with the timing of this video, it matches back to school season, I hope that lots of kids benefit from this video. Love you guys"
1,Honestly it is exhausting always being the one to keep friendships alive. When I talk to my mates they all say they have missed doing stuff like that and yadda yadda and I believe they mean it! But why do they not actively seek it then? I am by no means an extrovert but I don't understand how they can all let life-long friendships go to waste like that. I wanna be invited to something nice and thoughtful for once...
1,"Oh my.. 3 mil views in 3 days 
Bless the hearts and minds of all you. 
May we all find peace And what we label as happiness."
1," -  thats litterly the exact thing that happened to me, I moved away. And my only freind never has enough time to play with me, and just plays with others. ;("
2,Hey I'm smart and silly and nerdy and a bit strange who wants to be friends with me?
1,Australians looking at the location on that meetup map like...
2,"The best way to make friends is to join an orginisation, In activist organisations you will emediately feel accepted, no matter your race, gender or sexuality. and  it's super easy to sign up!"
1,It's not that easy smiling_face_with_tear
1,"Came for the loneliness info, stayed for the garage band bagpipes.  Stayed even longer for the headlining band bagpipes."
1,"I just wanted to say that I feel lucky to have content like this freely accessible on the internet. You guys rock! 
Much love from Brazil."
2,"There are friends who like to give, and some like to take. Besides planning myself to be more like a giver not a taker, I can also pick friends who don't really take too often."
2,needed this kurzgesagt. thank you
1, Praise the Emperor!
1,Getting old alone and thinking about what future brings makes u lonely its gets lonely everyday.
1,"I can’t overstate how important and welcome this video is. So many crucial concepts that we may have confusedly been aware of, now laid out in the open to really serve and help. 
Kurzgesagt, improving lives one video at a time."
1,"The way world goes now , we about to only have friends online mostly, especially with the new VR technology. So don’t worry if you don’t have enough friends or at all , become the better self and people will want to be friends with you ;)"
2,"Wow, thought this would not give me incites but might be good for friends. But, I feel it will make me check in more and let go of insecurity in the loss of friends."
1,"For the first time, I strongly disagree with your publication Kurzgesagt. You assume that most people who are strangers to us will be friendly to us. In my country, Poland, it is very difficult to find a stranger who is friendly to us. People are very withdrawn and unfriendly to us by default. You also claim that some research has discovered that remaining quiet in the classroom will arouse sympathy among our colleagues. Sorry, but in my country this is absolute nonsense. I and a few of my colleagues were mocked, laughed at, sometimes bullied too, precisely because we didn't speak up, because we were quiet and withdrawn. These were not isolated incidents. This went on for years, and I paid for it with the deterioration of my self-esteem and psyche. In life, it's very hard to get real trustworthy people who are worthy to be our friends. Also apparently this film is dedicated to people from western Europe and maybe North America, because for central Europe but also Scandinavia, e.g. Estonia the theories presented in this film do not work. I very much appreciate your Kurzgesagt channel, but here I have to disagree. But please keep creating these wonderful publications. Thank you."
1,so staying a loner. on own or forced will shorten life span. awesome baby. i m in for itthumbs_up
1,"At my 40s working 9 hours a day coming home to 2 amazing kids and my best friend wife I really have no time to spend with others.
I wish I had more time with friends but since I need to choose, friends will have to wait."
1,"As someone who slowly drifted away from there friends, only to realize it when it was already too late, I hope people can better prioritize there friends over meaningless task because of you don't you'll stare back wondering what went wrong"
1,Looking for friends who watch kurzgesagt ironically and judgemental!
1,This guy is an actual giga chad.
1,"I start to think that to string up friendship on the internet, where physical distance may be impassable, perhaps close match of values / interests could do the trick. Except there is no people browser."
2,great this vid made me sad
2,I only talk to my friends for about 155 minutes a week
2,YouTube knows me too well
1,Act. Don't show who you really are. Blend in with society and manipulate their senses or perspective about you.
2,Let's make some friends; I have a great business opportunity.
1,"This may sounds say bad,  but I don’t like having friends. Being alone allows me to be happy due to the fact I have a low social battery. I have friends but I don’t hang with them and I explore life in my own."
0,Damn I didn't know Kurzgesagt was getting personal with their insults now.
2,"What a great, whokesome video"
1,"Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                          /,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,. /,,/.      ,/."
1,This will get buried in the thousands of replies.  Thank you.  I love this channel and I love the occasional upbeat video to remind us why life is so amazing.
2,Fish are friends not food
1,I was just thinking about this question and then this video pops up face_with_tears_of_joy YouTube knows me well.
1,I have an issue lads... my group leader told me not to make any other friends to prove my loyalty. He also told me i couldn't breathe until he says so :(
1,"How do I weed out the people that stop putting in effort, or eventually take advantage of me, before I waste a bunch of time, money, and effort on another doomed friendship? It's too exhausting to play friend roulette all the time and never get any payout."
1,lol what happened to the old thumbnail? face_with_tears_of_joy
1,"*I CAN'T BELIEVE A TOPIC OF LONELINESS IS TRENDING #3 IN A DAY NOW!!!* o.O Kurzgesagt deserved an emmy for this to go viral right now!

I've decided to share a LOOONG comment after reading *Big Lobster's* comment in the comments below and couldn't thank more than enough for the viewers along Kurzgesagt for responding as this is a crucial topic for me to view this morning as mental health is really seen frown upon! 

It's around 7:07am. Arizona Mountain Time as I was scrolling down people's social experiences by having autism which is the mental condition I have (high-functioning) to struggling with social / generalized anxiety and also living at home with an elder sibling even though our mother still takes care of us when it comes to monthly bills at home that I can deeply relate to. Never knew how frequent us humans globally struggle with lack of connections as we have the internet to connect with another breathing human being throughout the tips of our fingers. 

Being an otaku (a person that's obsessed with animes) to being a Nintendo nerd throughout my childhood as a little boy, made me stick out like a Ditto in the wild doing my best to speak up and build platonic connections by strangers that are seen as Mew to me by feeling intimidated by their appearance / extrovertedness when it comes to being the popular people around them. Not only people gave me comments in the past that I dressed weird to being seen as a man-child by having a Pokéball backpack to wearing long colorful socks of Animal Crossing characters I've bought from Walmart but how they see me as unlovable to have any friends just because I don't fit the social bond that 95% of adults act/dress where I live today. Being that I live in a city that's known for late parties of having mariachis that last 'til 3:00am (fiestas por ejemplo) to dancing to spicy/hot foods that Kurzgesagt mentioned @  is something I haven't been a fan of as well as my elder brother whom is Half-Mexican as we both come from a Black family and not into the excited party scene that most Mexicans are into out here. That may be silly to say one's nationality defines them as a human being based off their ethnicity but it's been that way since I was in high school as I did had a few friends that were Mexican that hangout with me during lunch period in our school. We didn't participate any school dances we had in the campus that was common in our school as the school was 80% Mexican and having a little over 2,600+ students and are known for being both social & school parties or even after school activities as well which I also didn't bothered doing so since I was either rejected or left out to build long-lasting connections with. Even when graduation day approached, no one bothered taking pictures with me as we were about to earn our diploma as we were inside the stadium inside the state fair and even got rejected group of girls would reject to take a photo of me as I kindly asked if one of them would be okay walking around the stadium with me so I wouldn't feel lonely and almost wanted to cry that day. 

That was back in 2013 btw as this happened way before TikTok & Instagram became a serious thing to many teens / young adults in social media and known early on in my early adulthood I would struggle to form long-lasting connections for many years and possibly decades to arrive. Platonic connections (I'm asexual so I could care less about having a relationship) has always been a nightmare for me as I didn't really fit in with other people as I've been struggling with clinical depression within the past several years or so along having severe ptsd & deep trust issues due to a fake friend I had that stabbed me in the back and calling the police on me for being physical with me. She also struggled with bipolar like I do to being an alcoholic and losing her youngest brother due to a horrible car accident and had no one to go to except me. I don't want to dig deep into my past with her as I knew from the beginning I didn't want to build a friendship with her as something would happen but it does take a lot of willpower, mental strength, & courage to even accept one's friendship with anyone if you had a nasty childhood to being afraid to interact with anyone. 

Not sure what I'm saying here as it's now 7:31am. and still thinking on what to say as I have a dry mouth due to insomnia and only slept for an hour as this video really made me think a lot in my lifetime but just want to say for the ones that have friends currently, DON'T TAKE THEM FOR GRANTED! 

Whenever I go out to a public place such as a grocery store or even a park nearby, I can't assist to feel so jealous seeing the pair of people laughing together as I walk beside them if they give me a smirky look to even eat together as it makes my heart feel dark to not having that experience. Having a friend is one of the best gifts that any human being can have that millions I'm sure aren't lucky to have in this current techno/ai era of social media as you would be barely blissful to have an art to karate club nearby as I would have to go downtown by car to do so and not feeling mentally nor spiritually prepared to interact with others. 

Stating a few things relatable to Big Lobster, I just want to say on the 3 things from the top of my autistic brain I recommend from my own opinion you shouldn't say to someone that has no friends &/or struggling with loneliness. 

1. Go meet new people such as a sports club or meetup. 

A handful of people like me aren't into sports or living far away to meet someone they haven't met before online. 

2. Think about your family.

 It just makes people like me that struggle with suicidal thoughts & clinical depression more guilty to have those thoughts due to being severely hurt by other people in the past along with some family members that we can't get well along with.

3. Call a suicide hotline or calling 911 if they feel suicidal / clinically depressed. 

From my experience, I don't recommend at all as I even had the police involved a couple times that didn't treat me well to someone even calling the police on me just because I was not in a healthy state of mind that made things worsen to the point I cut connections with them completely! This experienced happened to me by someone I talked to on Reddit that was Trans whom was apart of the LGBT that wanted to be friends with me and got mistreated by them which made my mental health worsen way before I met them.

I don't want to go too long on my rant this morning as there are so many things going through my autistic brain at the moment and don't even feel comfortable reading nor replying any comments if anyone decided to write back to me as I'm deeply frightened to do so and not in a mentally stable either. Please don't take it personal and also deeply apologize if the 3 points I pointed out or anything may come off as offensive.

Other than my horrible high school and struggling with not having any friends as I don't even have a working phone from home as my S4 phone is water damaged and hoping to the heavens my mother & I could have it repaired by tomorrow, I've been doing my best to stay alive and not taking my own life away from the past and evil people I've met from my life! Even to this day, I have been inside my house since my S4 (Samsung Galaxy S4) phone was broken in almost 3 weeks or so as it's my lifeline to keep me mentally & spiritually stable to go for my walks to the grocery store while listening to my favorite animes or German music at peace during the nighttime. 

I've also wanted point out that giving out a complement to someone based on their outfit will really make their day healthier & happier if they manage to smile as I had encountered many adults near my age that called my geeky outfits cute while I had a horrible afternoon. It does wonders to another human being being kind to me in one of my worst days as I think about their comment about me from that day as it makes a huge difference no matter how small it may be. 

Thank you so much for posting this topic about Loneliness Kurzgesagt as I remember viewing your previous one eons ago and had to type out so much from how I currently feel as you're one of the only educational YouTubers out of a handful that I NEVER take for granted! green_heart

*Quoting what Stan Lee said himself...*

*- I guess 1 person can make a huge difference.* red_heartblue_heart

*PS:* This may be off topic but even though I feel lonely at home at night while my elder brother is at work as I don't talk to him much about my mental health that he can't do much to support me by, I couldn't thank more than enough for my 4 fans from YouTube that came over to our house to visit me awhile back as I only had spent a couple hours with them as I even cried my eyeballs out as they waved back at me while they walked downstairs. They were *Fergus, Cole, Juan, & Jack* in that order I believe as they did found out where I live due to videos I've shared in the past but somehow, they arrived at my house for a purpose as not only my gut told me to have the courage to invite them to my house but also how a fortune cookie I had predicted my dream to come to reality even if it was only for 2 hours. 

*PSS:* I feel I may cry again thinking about the last connection I had with 4 boys near my age as I'm going to be turning 28 in 3 months & 3 days as today's the 5th. anniversary after my Siberian Husky was put to sleep peacefully as he had abdomen cancer and just had to stop here as I need to have all of this of my bony chest while going through a quarter-life crises at the moment and just overwhelmed with emotions that make my heart beat frequently & faster. beating_heart"
1,I live in an isolated suburban development surrounded by sprawl in a small town. I hate it here because it's car centric and lacking in green space. I regret not making more friends in high-school. Being autistic to boot doesn't help
1,I prefer to be alone most of the time but I have a few close friends and my chosen family. The few I have is enough for me to feel happy with my social life
1,"Starting off that I can not spend any time except school hours (thanks to my mother) with anyone, can not make calls and play (thanks to, guess who, my mother) and started off by doing NOTHING social since fucking kindergarten (thanks to, guess who) then I dont have any friends in a society full of already made. I've always retreated to english youtube, media and things like that and I live in a place almost no one knows english, so I can't connect with people like that. I've got some serious anger issues (guess why? unhealed trauma) and can't keep any friendship for long.
I think im fucked"
2,i have done all of this and still have no friends
2,"Yeah I get impatient, I wanna be best friends already!"
1,I am sad that YouTube suggested this video to me smiling_face_with_tear.
1,The video we all needed
0,"It's hard to keep friends with the current suicide pandemic, I've lost 3 and 1 failed   attempt,I'm scared of making friends now."
1,No epic mountain music what’s that about hen
1,This  video came at the right time. Thank you
2,"Wrong. 
The answer to not making friends is:
Don't make friends.
Friends are for the weak."
1,"you just find ways to bloody depress people, everything you said is unreachable things to do for me and many others"
1,"I'm self employed and wanted to be all my life, but now I have a lot less money and practically no opportunity to meet new people since I don't have any coworkers.   I kind of envy people who get to go in and happily chitchat daily and make all these friends.  But ugh, I loathe going back under the yoke with bosses again and all that primate ranking jazz and living under a timeclock at my age.   So I'm damned if I don't.  Doesn't life suck indeed."
2,what ! Im an introvert and I love spicy food
2,"To quote the Care Bears, lol: ""to have a friend, first you need to *be* a friend""."
2,"I used to have friends but now I have none. Its cool though because I talk to myself, and I talk back to myself.  Me and myself are friends."
1,lmaoooo at the end they cropped out two of the friends
1,"This is a great video as always and I enjoyed every Kurgesagt video since its humble beginnings. However one crucial thing I find has been left out: how about the viewer, the person in question. In order to become a truly connective individual, you must be able to take a good look at yourself and if you are really feeling that lonely, what might be the cause of that apart from social media and technology? We all form our most basic social skills as an infant: the ability to read and express emotions I think behavioral science and childhood should have had at least a sidenote here in this video. ""Harlow's Monkey Experiment"" is something that often gets cited when we are talking about psychological development and the emotional needs of babies. So that is the only thing. Maybe you could make a feature about Sociopaths and Narcissists and how they are formed by society? Hope I could be of any service. Bravo, great animation! Loved the ""ICY DUCKS"" hockey gear. Cheers!"
1,"The thing about constant traveling is that you form and break friendships so easily as if they’re nothing, honestly it’s straining but hey; that’s life"
1,These days they just don't have good ideas to work on. This channel is still growing from making exciting videos about science to posting just whatever is on the plate. Hope you make good videos soon again.
1," ""Lemon"" Amp grinning_face_with_sweat
Someone in your crew is a bassist or guitarist..."
1,You should make a video about how poisonous the platform Tik Tok is
1,I would pay for a Kurzgesagt friendship/dating app hehe. Also love how detailed the graphics and animations in this video are! I was really rooting for the glasses dude and purple hair girl
1,"This really helps, I have been following this channel for more than idk 5 years and I've watched every video. Every video a special one for me.thank you"
1,"The whole part at  really struck me at a personal level. I’ve had a comfortable group of friends in my life that I’ve always taken for granted but recently I’ve found myself getting use to just being busy with my own personal hobbies and playing video games n stuff but because of my pointless business I’ve become lazy when it comes to maintaining my relationships. People offer a chance to talk to me, hang out with me by playing a certain game, go places, but I find myself more often than not feeling like it’s not a good time to spend time with them. It’s like I’m waiting for this perfect opportunity to do it but fail to do follow up. Also I don’t think my relationship with my gf is helping me because instead of taking my nights to find a chance to connect with someone, I rather just talk to my gf and spend hours with her instead. I know it’s best to put your relationships first, but I would be lying if I didn’t say I am prioritizing everything else over my friendships"
1,I think Kurz is just cruising ATM. Last few videos have been fluff at best
1,"Kurzgesagt is like my dad. He makes my day, them leaves for a month"
1,"As a person who has never made any friends in real life I can tell you that I was never into friendships up until now, when I was a kid I never made friends as I didn't know what to say or do to make one I was usually the most silent one and felt like a complete outcast to others in school, especially as I got older I remained as the silent one in all the classes and everywhere I was with the class in schools I only spoke to some of the kids in the class I was with them, but I never befriended them and I felt like wanting to be left alone, I was homeschooled and never made any friends ever. After nearly half a decade I finally made some friends of my age online, two of them at least which makes me happy that I got friends to hang out with online, but also sad I never made friends at school when I was still a kid and went there back then. I do plan to go to university and make some friends whether it being online and/or in real life. So a good life lesson would be that just because you don't have any friends of didn't make any at the age you were or wanted to in that age, doesn't mean you can't make many as you'll definitely make some or at least a few in the future one way or the other."
1,When I am around people I have lower my intelligence and aptitude and when the moment passes it suffocate me for even being around people.... I don't know why but it seems sometimes everyone hates me.
1,"Throw my life I learned that friend come and go , they are never the same and constit , you grow up and your friendship grows up with you mentally,  now the hard part is finding a GF or wife this is the hard part in life ."
1,"You don't know the half of it, buddy"
1,What im doing here
1,"Others: the internet is a bad place

The internet:"
1,"I’ve been very overweight my entire life and I realized that as ignorant as it may or may not be, it’s been a core reason I haven’t had friends."
1,Sadly reddit is blocked in my country
1,"Kind of odd. I used to be more outgoing and made lots of friends during my time in preschool, primary school and even high school. Now that I'm in college, I sorta become an introvert. Heck, I think I'm friends with the lecturers more than the other students"
2,"Bro, how do you make me hopefull and depressed at the same time?"
1,Ah! here comes the algorithm with another personal attack.
1,Don't remind me that I'm miserable
1,coffee
1,"I don't get it, why are we doing this? This whole video just sounds like work for no reason. Maybe I've just been alone too long, but being around other people is exactly the opposite of what I consider fun, so what is the point of friends? Followers I can understand. Connections I can understand. A lover I can understand. But why friends? What do they do? What is their purpose?"
2,for me getting drunk really helps with making friends
2,this video made me realise my friends are fake friends
1,Man why u calling us out like this.
1,"I needed this. I've been umming and arring about going to a work party, and this has helped tip me over to decide that I'll go."
1,"Unfortunately just like the loneliness video said, you eventually become addicted to being alone and then you don’t feel lonely anymore. You are just alone"
1,I moved across the globe and now most of my friends are my wife's friends. It's hard to open your heart and ask for friendship in your thirties as a lot of people already have friends groups.
1,Anybody here who needs a friend? I am happy to be one
1,"In part, because of events outside of my control, I find it nearly impossible to deeply connect with humans. Therefore, outside of my family, I am almost completely alone. Thus, I'm lonely."
1,"its technically true, a LOT of people have plenty of potentisl lifelong friends, sure some more then others but in the end you dont need a lot of friends, u just need to find them"
0,Lol that's sad
0,"Stop caring about friends because they either betray, die or worse ghost and leave you. Women are the worst offenders but men are just as bad. I learned dont even bother instead use them as steps on the ladder of success."
0,now I don't have any friends and I have never had close friends
1,"Some good reminders in this video. We need to do the things we know we should be doing, and stop doing the things we know we shouldn't be doing."
1, cap and a half no payed any attention to me in school
1,"Loneliness is harsh. I was an introvert and unable to show my personality to most people during my high school times, I had some friendships but sometimes we didn't share the same interests for going out during weekends, meeting new people etc. I moved out for university in a new city but from that time I retained only a few connections, while I failed to connect with a lot of people. During that time I fell into depression and panic attacks that today, after more than 5 years, I still have to struggle with. I moved 4 different cities and I never got the opportunity to stay stably in a place. When I get back home in the gap periods, my friends are either away, busy at work or don't want to hang out. I find it hard to find new ones because of always being itinerant. On top of this, I have never had a relationship and the lack of active friends makes it even more difficult to meet someone. I always hope that this can change and I work so hard for that but damn, the road is tough and there are always new obstacles. Sometimes I would just like life to give me some sign that I am going in the right direction."
0,Wtf is this sh*t? You used to have interesting videos.
1,"This video came a few weeks after I moved away for college and had to say bye to the childhood I had lived for over 18 years. Next chapter is never easy, but given enough *time*, I’m sure something will happen about that. I just gotta be the one who sets it forth."
1,why are these videos always target towards me D:
1,"Summary:
• start talking with people you dum dum"
1,Waking alone gives more happiness
1,"Eh, I'll mark myself as the ""not wanting friends"" type. And, honestly, I don't really ""get"" the reason why friend circles are so sought after. Yeah, having associates whom you can seek information from or report information to is always good... but ""friends""? Just... no.  

Heck, seeing as how everything is hopeless and pointless, putting emotional chains around people (""friendships""), even by accident, is something I wanna avoid as much as I can. It'd just leave more sad people when I finally get this stupid existence over with. So... yeah, ""making friends"" is illogical, irrational and... kinda irresponsible (at least for someone like me)."
1,Not even one mention of online communities and social spaces when we’re still in a global pandemic?
1,"how dare you make presumptions about me 







also correct, I am lonely"
1,You guys have got to stop using TikTok the Chinese are taking your data without you even knowing it.and spying on you
1,Here 10 minutes after upload and just in time to watch my phone ring smiling_face_with_tear
2,Jesus loves you Pls believe in jesus and go to heaven try praying my friend he died on the cross for your sins GB give your problems to jesus
1,the title threw me off ngl
1," - but you already said shared interests don't matter as much as proximity. Quit lying, it's all about proximity and being forced to wait around together."
1,"I moved to a whole new city last year to go to medical school, and... it's lonely. It's just so lonely. I tried to make friends but then Covid hit, I don't live in the expensive condo buildings downtown like 2/3 of my classmates do, and I don't go out to bars and drinking like them either. I feel like I missed my chance with my classmates. And it's just so lonely. I miss people."

0,"Damn, this to too relatable contenteyes"
1,"I feel like a lot of fking people need to see this cause Ive had a lot of people 'want to be friends' but not want to build that foundation and think i expect too much for friends at the start and wonder what my current friends think. My current friends dont get the expectation of time out of me because weve built that base already. You wanted to know me, i want to know you; then talk. dont ignore me. As the last video, im lonely and trying, why are you? Dont waste my time and accuse me of being demanding."
2,"no thank you.  no friends is way better.  no matter how good friends you are, there will come a moment when theyll choose themselves and end up stabbing you in the back or hurting you anyway.  leason learned"
1,What I learned from this video: You can keep axolotls as pets.
1,Video idea: What if gravity turned off for three seconds?
2,Right when I was in my loneliest lmao
1,"Remember, you are never really alone, as I will always be living under your floorboards thumbs_up"
1,What's YouTube trying to insinuate by recommending this to us?
1,"What if I start a new school where everyone has friends, apart from the one weird kid who knows what every bird and bug is. but you want to become friends with your classmates, but since they went to elementary together, they already had tight-knit groups that it’s hard to integrate yourself into."
2,"for me it depends
having a good life and few friends is enough
we will meet new friends or strangers when we work or travel"
2,Thank you
1,Literally was just thinking about this :(
1,"wearing kurzgesagt accessories daily helps to attract other kurzgesagt-lovers, and based on my experience I would say they were all very cute people"
1,At the beginning of the pandemic we were sure that we could just pick up our friendships where they left off. But because we were unable to spend time together for so long it felt like all our friendships were lost. EVERYONE FEELS LIKE THIS at the moment so if you reach out to meet with anyone they will be very grateful for it. We are all out of practice at forming and maintaining relationships.
1,It's only going to get worse in the future
1,And then there’s me… perfectly content with one friend
2,So... Anyone wanna be friends? Lol
1,"I have never loved a Kurzgesagt video more, or been hit harder by it. By the sciences, i love this channel so dang much."
1,"Never have I ever felt so good after  l stared talking to less people now but  when I was a teenager I went through hell for feeling lonely even if I was surrounded by ""friends"" and people."
0,I rather be alone than being with bad company
2,this vids makes it seem as it having friends is a good idea
1,"ik why im lonelu, my parents decided to move us from australia to turkey, we had 4 months notice from our parents, they started organisings shit, we left all our family and friends, school, our farm we had to sell,, all our stuff we had to sell, all our animals and poets we had to give away, and then well return to australia in 2 fricking yrs, where everything will be different, and i wont even wanna be there anymore"
1,"I'd forgotten just how ""use your app or leave"" normal unlogged reddit is, for someone new it would be very unwelcoming"
1,"A lot of us who grew up with the internet entering our 18-20’s, recently graduating Highschool have been affected by this lonely anomaly, especially during the pandemics social isolation period. Probably does feel as if Kurzgesagt and many other channels are reading our minds or whatever, but it’s just because it’s affecting so many of us"
1,Are the birds out for looking friend? I didn't see them here
1,And what if you are under 18 years old? thinking_face
1,Its hard to make friends when there are allot of sociopaths around.
1,Two big physical modern barriers they should probably have mentioned; car-centered urban spaces as well as the lack of public areas that allow 'loitering' (i.e. just being legally allowed to exist in a space). Remember to have money if you want to be social. :(
1,"I was going to self harm because I’ve never been allowed a friend in life, But I think the real solution is harming others, it actually gets their attention. If they are going to hate you regardless might as well give them a good reason!"
2,Okay can we make going out with friends not bankrupt me so I can have money left over to save for retirement?
1,"I feel so alone. I put myself out there and can’t seem to make a meaningful connection. Try meetups and apps, and lack any retention. I have so much love to give yet nobody to give it to

Soon I could be working fully remotely in a city that isn’t home. Being an adult sucks."
1,People are turds
1,I know why you guys are making them... But I kinda miss when kurzgesagt did science rather than self help stuff
2,Thank you kurzgesagt for all your Videos about lonelyness and friendships! I really am confident now to change my Life. (Greetings from Germany ;) )
1,People who care about friends conform to a weak mentality and need to compensate it in cattle thinking
1,I would never find friends. I'm not desirable.
1,"as much as I like your videos, this is too much,  I will just stay this way. 
It will show me how long does it takes to break me."
2,that's a lovely idea
0,"The problem is, people don't like me"
1,"I find it difficult because what I feel is fear of belonging, fear of identifying with something. I don't know how to explain it, I don't want anyone to feel like I'm part of thieir lives. Sounds strange, but I convinced myself that being the observer is best."
1,Really this channel is very important
2,the girl from the last loneliness video has best friends now. good for her!
1,This channel for some reason has the ability to make me feel hyped for the explanation and conclusion part of the video.
1,I never thought I would see kurzgesagt animate Tiktok.
1,I'm lonely because my values are higher and more humane than others around me.
1,Geez 1.7m views in 17 hrs... goes to show the mental state of the world and how isolated internet and social media has made us
1,"FOR A MOMENT, I SAW THIS TITLE AND FELT HOPE, OR MAYBE RELEIF that maybe my feelings are right. The cold realization that even before covid i had begun to pull away. the pandemic made it easier to get lost in place. no one notice as the calls stopped then the posts then the texts then what's left? I had hurt everyone and never knew how. i didn't want to ever, but no one would help me as i begged them to tell me what i was missing about being a normal person. why must you forgive family? Why am i supposed to know you never tell the truth when asked for honesty. why am i the bad guy for saying to a person directly what everyone else says in secret? How are things supposed to improve if we don't acknowledge problems? If a person says they are hurt and can not talk about ""what you did"" to them, then start talking again months later as if nothing had happened why am i still not allowed to know or ask?  
For 30 years ive bee suffering in terrified isolation (im 37 to clarify. i just want the cold empty inside to let go and be  part of more than just me) 

So im saying that i saw this title and had a spark of excitement then flooded by whats written above and much much more. feelig even more lonely remembering the person that saved my life and gave me a chance that i never earned and that i tried to take all the help from the amazing people i was put around and inevitably i was alone again and trying to pick up pieces but none seem to remain. 
whats worse? watching this episodeto learn ive no options, or that maybe i just projected all this to an unrelated but surely good episode of a show by smart people. most likely i jus fight the extreme embarassment that comes if i post this and hope my BP stays ok and never thin of this again, maybe some of this bile will stay outside my mind for any time since i leave it here."
1,i'm so convinced i don't want/need friends that i don't have any... hows that supposed to work again?
2,"THANKS youtube reccomendations, yeah i'll take it."
1,This video is extremely well directed and produced. This is a new favorite video for me.

1,Now thats a video that i can use.
1,The sequel we've been waiting for 3 years
1,Just watched a video about how the lack of social connections and increase of internet access has destroyed our abilities at a young age to make profound human connections.
1,"There's something you don't address though. People can be nasty and they might backstab you. That's why making friends is really hard. And then if you're a minority when it comes to your worldview, you might find yourself in a position where those you care about violate principles you hold dear. Which is a painful experience that might prompt you to opt for loneliness."
2,Who wants to be my friend?
1,"I moved from one place (with very few friends) to A new one and 9 years later with no social circle so to speak.
I think how we deal with it important as well. 
I'm indifferent I guess."
2,"Vince fans, this video is for you."
1,Naaa true selfvalue is when u dont need someone to tell u how much ur worth.

1,perfectly average... doesn't sound cheering nor a good thing... for me at least
1,"It does feel like we're all lonelier as a species, despite all living in massive cities."
2,making friends on your 30s is like playing game on expert mode..
1,"there are no ""friends"", simply bc everyone is a narcissistic a - hole who doesn't care abt others. one will never be appreciated, no matter how nice and funny one is, nobody will care for one or put as much effort into a friendship as one does themselves.
nowadays, everyone is conpletely brain dead."
1,Communities were banned from PlayStation how would people find friends?

1,As much as I want to have people in my life.  Reaching out and socializing is more exhausting than the most physical activities i can perform
0,"I really don't want any friends, thank you."
1,Basically: Go outside
1,Videos like this make me want to cry. I have no idea why.
1," I have a really hard time with this specifically. I don't have a middle ground. It's either I'm sealed shut or I'm telling you my entire backstory. And I never know if it's okay to spill my guts, so naturally I've accidentally kiilled quite a few potential friendships this way."
1,Wherd all the birds go this video? But this will help
2,"I needed this, thank you"
1,I find people in general add stress and complications to many tasks that otherwise wouldn't be there if I did them alone. Living alone and being happy with it for as long as I had as an adult kept me away from situations I witnessed many peers and colleagues struggle through. Also taught me that having a small circle is much more valuable to living a life of peace.

2,friendship doesn’t exist
1,That's not true about introverts preferring less spicy foods. Spicy or less spicy has nothing to do with being a extrovert or introvert. Both me and my friend are introverts and love very hot spicy food and I cook curries with Carolina Reapers the hottest chilli. I also know a extrovert that thinks black pepper is too hot and doesn't like spicy food at all.
0,"im an introvert, and dont like to have friends."
1," - Interesting - I'm an introvert that loves spicy foods.  I know you said ""generally speaking""...  I think spicy foods are a relatively ""safe"" way to get a sensory rush.  Aside from shortness of breath if it's TOO hot or whatever.  I mean, it's just food, it's just me, as opposed to doing something like karaoke or dancing where other people can see/hear, and risk embarrassment."
2,Can I have a guide on how I can lose friends? I am tired of people.

1,"This is quite an interesting topic. I personally was generally not a sociable person before the quarantining started. However, I suddenly got way more talkative in the online classes purely because there was no other sound. This, really made me look like a man who is the too much talking person in the room. Then suddenly when school got normal again, I realized I made a relatively bad reputation with everybody from only me talking, now I was seen as a bragging egotistical instead of the quiet kid. I, personally, don't think I am truly egotistical, but sheerly comedic with my personality. And now that I have seen both extremes and in my opinion, neither are good, both left me at a alone life for years now. I am only hoping that my old reputation can slowly vanish, I can find a middle road in the socialability and make a better me."

JESUS CHRIST will Not make you take any mark, and He will punish the tyrannical ANTI Christ. The ANTI Christ will get a terrible wound, but cure himself to reinforce his deception to decieve the non-Christians and the lukewarm Christians. (look up lukewarm Christians on Christian websites and/or the Bible.) the AC will be world famous and very popular. he will make people take a mark on r hand or forhead. there will be a severe punishment for not taking it. The ANTI-Christ is a control freak, the opposite of Jesus Christ. Jesus uses His power for GOOD, NOT EVIL. This is BIBLE PROPHECY. Dont trust the false god, his goal is to get people into the lake of fire. he  will go there too, despite all the FALSE MIRACLES HE WILL DO! Repent of your sins to Jesus Christ before its too late, you could die today!"
1,"I'm noticing more and more diversity from the character designs to the variety of jobs / interests portrayed. It's veeeery cool to see because this allows not only a stronger relatability but also gives your story more depth and credibility which allows for the message to lend even better in the mind of the spectator ! We feel more seen and engage with the storyline better. I suggest if not already to hire storywriters to help make the visual story even more relatable

As always well done, and keep up the great work, you have all of our support ;)"

2,"wow, you really posted this at this time"
1,"Extroverts tend to crave sensory stimulation, spicier foods, loud music, or the excitement of engaging a crowd.

Meanwhile, I'm an introvert that craves sensory stimulation (I always need ""something"", an audiobook when falling asleep, watching something while eating, reading a book on the toilet, music while in the shower etc), the food I eat is so spicy, most people have stomach issues after it, loud music... Well, depends, on speakers? No. On headphones? Yes. On a concert loud is good though. But maybe that's mostly due to the fact, that I have good headphones and most speakers are quite shite on loud volume. Engaging a crowd? Sometimes, but mostly no. 

Sooo... maybe I'm just a shy extrovert? Nah. Introverts just come in many shapes and sizes! Or maybe I'm just a bit autistic, that's also a possibility."

2,"thanks, i can now make friends"
1,"I always find your videos incredibly interesting and well done, but too often depressing. Until this video! Wow, I have never felt more depressed! Well done. 
What about having given up friends after they've screwed you over too many times? But then giving them another chance, only to be screwed over even worse? 
At 62 years of age I'm down to half a dozen close, dear friends that I value immensely. I've tried making new friends but they always end up moving away or something. 
In Vancouver people are in cliques as friends. You can only orbit their clique at a party or bar. They don't let you in. When the get together ends you're lucky if 1/4 of them say good night to you, even though you're right there while they're leaving."
2,Not even have time to kill myself so good luck to me for making friends but hopefully I will gone by this year
1,"I'm having an interesting moment.  I'm crying, not because I don't have many friends, or because I have feelings of loneliness.  I actually enjoy being alone.  I have tears running down my face because I have an autistic child who doesn't have any friends, desperately wants friends, and doesn't know how to make friends, because being social in a neurotypical world is hard.  I wish it was as simple as watching a Kurzgesagt video."
1,"I am in no way lonely, and whenever i want to i can hang out with people, but i am a severe extrovert [97-98% on tests] and that feeling of being alone after ive been with someone hurts, even if it just lasts a few hour maximum."

1,"I'm 22, and now, I have absolutely no friends. I can't feel connected with the people in my hometown, I can't leave my country to go to a university, and for a long time I haven't been happy. I had social anxiety issues; I thought it was  just a part of me, so I stopped my previous relationships to be alone. After realization, for a long time, I tried to fix myself. I think I managed to deal with my anxiety, yet, the amount of change I had was so immense that I couldn't even be friends with my old friends anymore; as if they were only friends with my old version. I found new hobbies learned three languages and many other skills, all alone. I can't take it anymore. I wish I could go to an architectural school."
2,Have a few people I’m gonna recommend this video. Not that they don’t have friends they just are annoying.
1,"I've watched alot of these videos on being lonely, but the more I watch these the more I realize I'm just going to be alone."
1,"didn't watch the video yet and not sure i will, but i just felt like saying, bruh, i go to the science channel to get distracted and smile about it, not to get a punch in the stomach -___-"
1,I just send message to 30 of my oldest conversation and it turned pretty well. Some didn't answered but all people that did answer where happy to share a conversation winking_face
1,"I feel, that this video was curated just for me. I been going through a complicated time where I graduated during coronavirus, and because of that, I not only lost every connection I had in school. This is something that alot of Kurzegart Viewers will resonate to everyone. And I really do hope a life long connection is made for other people who follow their advice."
1,Never been called out so hard in my life
1,"Lonineless... after so long, you get used to it, it nearly does not hurt anymore, but it will always hurt just a little bit, you just get used to it"
1,Not that easy if u have severe social anxiety
1,I’ve tried. It always ends.
1,"At this point I'm so fucked up that I need tutorials on how to make friends


So here I am."
2,Who wants to become friends face_with_rolling_eyes
1,"This is actually really interesting and ima save the vid, but it makes me wonder what if you don't feel you're part of the group? I at times when im with friends i feel like i just don't belong, or like im the dissonant note."
1,"Thank you. I am looking at a divorce right now and most of my friends in the area were cultivated by my wife. (She was the social one) Now with everything that happened, I have no one, they all clung to her. Im trying to figure out new ways to get friends and this helps a bit"
1,Im not even watching this
2,Man I love this channel
0,But what do I do when my friend betrays me
1,"I have 0 friends
not sure when and how that happened, but maybe a 6 day week in an other city doesn't help"
1,just hit a bong guys fs
1, ... although you are perfectly average. face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy This oddly gave me a BIG BIG smile. Thank you.
1,"That is my problem... I tend not to ask about the other person, as I am afraid they might think I am being noisy and annoying trying to get into their private life... I think I had such experience in the past, when somebody was annoyed with me asking... It is hard"
1,"Kurzgesagt: its easy to form firendships in school and universitys 
Me: Oh"
1,this gonna hit xqc hard
1,Is this a personal attack youtube? This was first on my recommended...
1,This is lowkey anti tiktok video
1,amazing how i am an extremely generic person yet literally every english language video about head stuff is opposite to everything in my life
1,Didn't know Sheldon Cooper made videos.
1,Bro WHY TF IS THIS RECOMMENDED TO ME ? well i do feel lonely often BUT HOW DID YT KNOW
1,I’ve been called out
1,thanksred_heart really
1,"This is highly relevant to me. I moved to another country in my 30s and been feeling more lonely than ever. There are some factors I can think of:
- I know no one in the area. Yes, I have a few friends in the country, but everyone lives in a different town and it is difficult to spend time with them
- I find it difficult to find a group of people with similar age group, stage of life and interest
- The language barrier definitely makes everything much harder and makes me afraid to approach people
- I am an introvert, so probably the idea of building a casual relationship is taxing and pointless for me"
1,"Heh, This video shows us that sometimes going out for a beer with friends is better for us than the health effects of alcohol"
1,"I never connected intro/extrovert character traits w/ music or food preferences. I generally consider myself an introvert but I love (very!) spicy food and heavy metal, and while I don't enjoy large crowds, going to exotic restaurants and rock concerts are probably my two favorite activities when it comes to interaction w/ friends & acquaintances. Humans are complicated..."
2,"How many friends are enough?

Yes."
1,"Uhm, anything for something reasonable like Kurzgesagt. Living in my country is a toxic overload of toxic people"
1,"clicked for the memez, stayed for the advice. i love this channel sm :'("
2,Exurb1a also did a video about friends being important. I recommend the video
2,"Thanks, great tutorial!"
1,ngl seeing this was a slap in the face after just ranting to my bsf about how our friends always leave us out and make us feel lonely and insecure
1,Me and the boys gotta stick the vibe
1,Lol player trying to approach a woman:
2,"Ok, so for anyone who wants to solidify a friendship, and are over drinking age, GO AND GET DRUNK WITH YOUR FRIEND. 80% of my solid friendship are made were solidified via getting drunk together rolling_on_the_floor_laughing"
1,I'm the one that knows lots of people and connects them together! Who wants in?
0,Not lonely and I don't need friends. I'm good alone
1,After seeing the title I thought about my russian friend pretty interesting guy tbh
1,Well this video is oddly very specific to my life right nowface_with_tears_of_joy
1,"I moved cities and it ruined my life. I am in an atomized suburb in a city with about 200,000 people. 

Everybody sticks to the networks they already know. 

I'm 29, I lost my entire social network that I've built up all my life. 

I still talk to close friends from my old town, but it's not the same as being face to face, plus the communication diminishes over time. 

It's been over a year and nothing has seemed to work the way it used to..

If things don't change, I'm not trying to be hyperbolic or whatever. .. I am probably going to kill myself before I get to age 30. 

I've tried all these forms of superficial advice, it just doesn't work in 2022 like it did in 2015. 

I had a productive and big social circle ALL OF MY LIFE. 

So I don't think it's me that's the problem, it's the environment that I'm in that's the problem..

It doesn't open me up to any new networks. 

I've seen a therapist,  

The best resource I have is my dad, but he is just too old to ""understand the severity and be proactive."" Or else he would FORCE the new $b mixtapes (esoteric reference) .

and like everyone else, it's always this same superficial advice. 

Which some of the superficial advice works... that's how I built my big older social network in my old town. 

In this new town, NONE OF this superficial stuff works. It is my #1 priority. 

But if I don't have anybody else to reciprocate this... then it fails. 

I am playing a zero sum game,  and knowing that, I'd rather die before age 30 if this is how it turns out 

Unless I can convince the older people in my life to ""look at things in a new way and be very very proactive instead of passive"" 

The superficial advice is decent, 4/10 decent.  

But it doesn't help someone like me. 

It delays the problem because people especially older people think the superficial stuff will one day net something.

What about the days in between where it doesn't net anything?  

Living in that isolation is no way to live. 

You can't build something from having ""absolutely zero, nothing."""
2,Ayo the tittles are looking more and more like insults now lol jokes aside great video
1,Why was this video with PEOPLE rather than DUCKS?
1,Hate to admit it but people are not worth the lies. Or rather i am not. At this point i dont really care. upside-down_face

I can cry by watching your videos can clear a lot of unwanted thoughts from mind . I get motivated and relaxed sparkling_heart"
1,Why was this recommended I’m not even subscribed grinning_face_with_sweat
1,"What happened 
They talking about all tomorrow"
1,You uploaded this at exactly the moment I realized I have too less friends loudly_crying_faceblue_heart
2,These new things at the shop are the cutest ;-;
1,"this is condescending cope 
the reason people have fewer friends is bcs works takes to much energy 
and bcs public spaces are completely owned by private companies 
without money you cant do anything but hang out with hobos in the park"
2,"I just wanted to see this video because, like, I have friends, but I feel excluded from them...


Also it was different to me, during the pandemic I made lots of friends online, some of them care more about me than the school friends."
1,"Its so hard hanging out with my friend because his mom is the most inflexible person to ever exist. I would ask ""yo, wanna go to the beach later?"" and his mom would come in and be like, ""not today, but maybe in a few weeks."""
1,"rename this to ""how not to be the brick"""
1,"Yeah, that just hit somewhat in time... Well, 3 months after that.
Long story short, my boyfriend broke up with me because ""he couldn't feel the same as at start"" while I still feel it to him... And while we are still best friends and do many things together, I don't try to make any more friends for now. I'm just too scared it might happen again... And that was my 2nd broke up... There was first one but yeah... Other story."
2,Looking for friends is stupid. Loneliness is freedom!
1,"I am deeply introverted (I know, such a rare find on the internet) and the only true friend I've ever made was when I built up the courage and talked to another kid who wasn't talking to me for the first time in my life, she's still my only friend and I've never done anything that outlandish since then"
2,really good video
1,"most important:
dont wait on anyone, just do your thing and people/friends will follow.
if you sit around ""waiting"" for something to happen or someone to appear you wont get it."
1,"You make videos on how bad meat is, but then you illustrate a BBQ with meat? Really? C'mon."
1,"As a college freshman at a university far from home, I have a hard time keeping up with my peers because I don't usually reach other people to be acquainted (or  befriend) them. thank you kurzgesagt for giving me a bit of that push needed to motivate me to open up with others, even for a bit.. will try to do so tommorrow in my chem lab class!!!"
1,Being a introverted teenager with a busy schedule and then turning to a social person in your 20s is so hard…I never learned HOW to make friends and now I’m scared to try.
0,I would rather die alone than be friends with the mindless drones I'm surrounded by.
2,"Hello friends, I hope you're all doing okay. Wanna meet up to go bowling on the weekend?"

2,"I got 10,000,000 FB friends!  Obviously, a sign of a narcissist. LOL"
1,"I’m quite convinced that American suburban infrastructure left us quite vulnerable to loneliness in adulthood. Coupled with the pandemic, social media, and student loan debt keeping adults in their family home, it’s no wonder depression and anxiety have become an epidemic"
1,I got 3 friends that i can send them anything and i dont need more actually. Thank god
2,Is there a good way to make friends with people who are already friends with each other?
1,My cousin needed this video so bad... Shame he isn't with us anymore :(
1,"It has been so hard for me to make any new friends. There were two almost friendships that I had that almost immediately imploded because the other person did something awful to me. Idk if i have a sign on my back that says kick me, but it has made it super hard to trust anyone and open up. I've also lost touch with many old friends. But I guess im going to give it another go. I have some friends and a loving partner, but I am definitely a shy extrovert and crave friendship. I wish i could have a best friend again. My partner fills this role plenty, but i miss having a close platonic relationship like that."
1,"""If you are homeless, just buy a house"""
1,This is funny
1,I am probably the many unlucky fellows that was a never accepted in any circle in my lifetime so far. Maybe I'm selling myself too short but for now I am a lone wolf. wolf
1,Scientific proof that tik tok is destroying society
1,The deaths from mental illness that came from our pandemic responses will be levels far higher than those who died from the disease. It was like we were as a culture at a breaking point to potentially save ourselves from the lonely epidemic and we accelerated it instead.
1,"""EVERTONE'S A WIENER"" was pretty good, not gonna lie. "
1,The fact that this is #1 on trending ironically proves I'm not alone lol
1,"the thing w the tiktok stat... as a teen, i spend most of my time online because i have no friends. i don't know where the parties or events are or when, when you're ostracised like most teens are from each other, you spend time on the internet."
1,"Never ""knew"" how bad my oversharing was until i started on my ADHD meds lol"
1,I searched up omori and found this

1,"I've always been ""that guy with a lot of friends"" and I'm still today, but thanks to this video I've got some new friends with a lot of interest in common! That's amazing, I've rarely could talk about my passion (at least, not in deep) with my friends since thay had completely different interests. A big shout out to all the group of Milan fire 
Ty kurzgesagt heart_exclamation"
1,"My younger self could’ve used this video, but I’m glad I came across it nowrelieved_face"
1,I need one on how to become lonely and not seem like a bad guy. I got rid of my cell phone and unplug my home phone. I still get overwhelmed.
2,eversince my ex left me i have felt like i don’t have a best friend and we’ll i don’t and haven’t really known why i have tried
2,Thanks
1,"I was just talking to people about how lonely I am, this came at good time"
1,"Well, I live in Romania, here most of ppl get friends if they are good looking, u re popular only if u are u copy paste and be like the others, those Who are lonely they make fun of them, it s a common thing for balkan countryes, I would have liked the ideea for some clubs where only introverted or lonely ppl to go and meet, persons Who have the same problems, where we can discuss knowing everyone have the same problem, sadly thag doesn t exist, most of us stay in home, Girls, boys, alone, waiting to find some ppl like us, but now in my 19s it s just geting more and more sad, so good luck to everyone, have a nice day and sry for my english"
1,This is basically Kurzgesagt's overanalysis of telling you to touch grass.
1,"I'm surprised how many views this has tbh, go talk to someone..."
2,“Examine what kind of person you are”. *breaks down*
1,Kurzgesagt knows when to remind me of my loneliness

1,"That is why i bought a rope today, bye friends"
1,"As an introvert spicy food lover, I feel misrepresented grinning_face_with_sweat"
2,Thanks YouTube algorithm
1,congrats on 19 mil and trending! even though i am younger than most of you general audience (im 12) i still am very much fascinated by your vids and the hard work you put in them! keep up the good work! :DDD
1,Because I'm sitting here alone in my room watching freaking youtube videos at random?
1,"Dont play where you work. Make friends, but dont make gf/bf."
2,Can you do a video on love red_heart ?
2,"nah friends are just transactional for survival. if you have no benefits to give, you have no friends. people are self serving and scary AF."
1,He's stalking me i think
1,Hey 24s late
1,"The issue in small rural towns is that there are zero activities or groups for me. None. Nothing around here, including the people, interest me in the slightest. Especially if you're a guy, no one will initiate contact with you and always being the one to start contact is exhausting. 

Even worse when the state you live doesn't align with your political ideas or even worse ostracize you simply for existing. It's infuriating when you don't have the means to move to a better place."

1,"Bro this was in my youtube for you page, my YFYP is trying to tell me something...."
1,"Ok but can you actually tell me HOW to do it
Like I see people at the library but HOW do I do it"
1,"Thanks for the video. I’m gonna stay in touch and reconnect with people with others, and make new ones. I just find it hard to be present with others and feel connected. Not because I don’t care, but it’s hard getting out of my own head."
2,I'd love to have new friends on my Instagram slightly_smiling_face
1,Pretty much given up at this point. No matter how many volunteer group I try someone in it always turns it into something political.
1,The fact this is trending is kind of sad loneliness is such a prevalent thing nowadays. I think technology plays a large role in why many young people feel isolated.
1,"Thnxs kurzgesagt for this video
Actually I have seen it 4 months ago but now a days I am feeling kind of lonely and suddenly this video pop up again thanxs for the motivation"
1,"My friend has been struggling with making new friends. She's extremely introverted and in a really bad place due to somewhat recent traumas. 
This video, and the video on loneliness, are super excellent tools to have when you're going through a lonely spell. We all hit it sometimes, and there's always ways to address it green_heart

Thank you guys."

1,Just got back from the first Kurzgesagt meetup in town. Was so much fun we are going to do it again next week partying_face
0,This is just 13 minutes of personal attacks
1,"I've never commented on these posts before.

That said, causation does not mean correlation,  I don't have friends, truly, I don't.  Why?  By choice.  People suck, they talk about you behind your back, I'm quite happy, arguably,  far happier without ""friends"" than I ever was with.

I don't ""have"" to spend time with anyone, nor do I want to.  I have 3 kids and a FT job plus my wife.

Whom by the way, IS my best friend.  I love spending time with her, I think as long as you're happy, friends will come, or show you that they're not as needed."
1,"I do new frendships at pandemic
EZ"

1,"friends are hard to prioritize in an extremely atomized, busy, taxing capitalist world"
1,This felt really useful to hear.
1,I started crying right away into the video..
1,Are there studies linking introvertedness and extrovertedness to food and musical tastes? I find it awfully presumptuous to say that all extroverts enjoy spicy foods and loud music while introverts do not.
1,ah did i do it first???
1,I can’t socialize because where I live everyone is rather high on meth or a ynnarT
2,Videos idea how to find love

1,Today is my 21st birthday and no one wished me a happy birthday besides my family.
1,Na because the fact that you have to make a video for this is extremely sadskull
0,I don't want friends i want money
1,How do I make friends who like JRPGs when there are literally no people in my entire school who have spent as much time in them as me?
0,"I don't want friends, just need a fuckwoman."
1,Why do I feel like it's teasing or a bit cheeky to send this to someone? It kinda implies that they don't know how to make or don't have friends... Either way another great kurgesat video.
1,"I think my biggest issue is overthinking... Im so used to breaking everything down and trying to understand it, but it means ive basically given myself anxiety by always overthinking anything and everyones actions... Its not something i can change, just something id like to overcome."
2,"I needed this, thank you."
0,but I feel like everyone is so dumb ..I can't be their friend.
1,Kurzgesagt is probably one of the best project of this century. You are helping humankind. Thank you for changing my life and millions of others.
2,Yeah right
1,"I liked this video so much, i started giving my coworkers plastic bags filled with my pee"
1,"Yeah, I guess I am lonely.  I gave up so much to raise my kids and try to be a good husband, and I didn't regret that because I was working towards something.  But Now my kids are older and my wife barely talks to me.  I love my kids and hanging out with them, but I'm still their dad, that isn't a role you can set down.  I wish I had worked harder to maintain the few friendships I had, but working our way out of poverty with 4 kids didn't leave much time.  Hopefully this is a transitory period in my life that will lead to greater health and fulfilment.  My suggestion to younger people:  don't get married and have a kid at 22 years old unless you like to struggle.  Maybe wait until you are around 30 to have a truly serious relationship, you'd be surprised at who you are then compared to a few years before."
2,I was having a good day until I saw this.... But I shouldn't be upset Kurzgesagt is here to ruin everything.
1,As always incredible videos
1,Yeah I agree in some part that good friends could make our life more joyful and happy. But I wanna mention that there are NOT always good people outside. Making new friend can be risky and you cannot handle with a lot of friends like over 10 people. Life is mine. So I personally think of giving attention to my life alone is the most important part of what i have to do rather than trying to create and maintain many social connections.
1,"I do have a lot of close friends, but it’s really hard to do stuff together, it’s seems like the only thing we can do is either go to each other houses or parties. When ever I try getting people to do other things it seems like no one is ever up too."
1,when I look back in my life when I am at my 30 I really did not have any close friends. and a few friends I had was not really close they were all like somebody you know that's all.
1,Why don't they teach you these really important things in school? Thanks K
1,"I’ve been battling depression and loneliness for years and the issue that I feel I face is that people never show that they are interested in me, and they don’t show that they care, even when I try to invite them out or spend time with them or show interest in them."

2,I need more money not more friends

1,I know why you are watching this video..... :(
1,"""classrooms, clubs or dorms"", i left high school two years ago to start my career, and have moved cities since - have never felt so alone and bored in my life, i totally underestimated how hard it was to find new friends after school"

2,Realllyyy this was recommended to me in  am in the morning? ;(
1,"I'm a senior citizen.  All of my friends from my younger years were apparently smarter and moved away from this town and for the most part fell out of touch decades ago.  However, I am not lonely.  Well I've always been a bit of loner, even when I had friends.
For sure, the pandemic didn't affect me very much when compared to how desperate some people became during the lockdown.  I was just fine, and still am."
1,"idk dude i have a lot of friends i hang out with daily many over my life i'm still constantly feeling lonely even around them i have only ever not felt lonely around two people before whom aren't in my life, what do :("

1,"How to make Friends? There are NO FRENDS AT ALL!!!
We Humans will always have some type of resentments toward one another.
It is just the way it is. People will say that are in some type of relationship either Intimate or strictly platonic,  that they have no angst or resentment toward their so called friend or friends.
There in nothing wrong with this. Just keep people at a distance and not inside your own "" Mental Personal  Space"" .
How often will we find ourselves alone and feel completely happy emotionally and mentally?
Just remember there are NO FRIENDS!"
1,"I felt a little funny clicking on this. Like defensive. I'm thinking ""I have friends."" Like Kurzgesagt was judging me."
1,"This is so simplistic that it's not realistic. Good clickbait for views and $$$$.  Fact of life is that friends also have $$$$ signs in their eyes. You need to give people and friends around you profit. Lots of profit. And you often need to accept that not everybody pay's it fair share of taxequivelant. Some even steal your time or try to get your friends that you collected with your own investment.   Spending time with people will eventually always end with 'et tu brute?""'"
1,"This video is about as holistic and considerate as kancho. It ignores basic facts that it mentions moments, even seconds, earlier"

2,I feel like they directed this at me
0,what happened to the cool space shit
1,"I still have my dearest school friends even though we’re all nearing 40 squinting_face_with_tongue But is has been very difficult to maintain our friendships over the past 10 years due to them becoming mothers woman_shrugging It becomes soooo much harder to meet up , the first few years they barely wanted to leave the kids at home so I would always have to come to them. It is also very difficult to have a proper/deep conversation due to constant interruptions. Also there is the mom-bubble, every conversation was about their children. It gets a bit tiresome after a while but I hung on because I know my friends do love me and I love them. I just started writing more instead of calling smiling_face It is very much fun to be penpals actually. They thought so too. But I notice it has become easier now that the children are no longer so small. Their mom’s are more comfortable leaving them alone for a girls night out, shopping spree or a weekend away. Also conversations are no longer interrupted by screams or cries or only have children as their topicwoman_shrugging Our friendships have definately changed but if we made it through the small children phase I am sure our friendship is truly for life smiling_face_with_open_hands But yeah, hard work sometimes on both sides squinting_face_with_tongue Like any relationship really."

1,"Whoa, a thousand comments in 20 mins?!"
0,You dont have friends because you're a desperate mess. Befriend yourself first.

1, Dimond life by Sade! I see I share the same musical taste as someone from the Kurzgesagt team. Do you want to make friends?
1,I think I'm lonely but I feel fine. I only have one best friend with three friends in my group chat who acknowledge my existence. The others just never asked me or tagged me. I feel fine tho as I'm used too it and focused on my games but I know that this habit ain't good especially when I will enter university
1,Damn I guess my recommended page decided to be especially mean today
1,"""Want to make friends ? Just try harder and be patient""

I got rejected by close friends, really REALLY close friends for absolutely no reasons. They went from adoring me and me adoring them to me being a worthless piece of shit and completely ghosted me and kicked me out of the group. You know what the funny part is ? This happened to me twice. Not only is my social life completely destroyed, but my ability to create a new one too ! Holding on to that tiny bit of hope they will accept you back, but they never do.

This video is hurtful. I basically am completely destroyed mentally in all ways, and you tell us that, everyone can make friends just by opening themselves to others ? So what am I ? Trying to make friends and getting shit on everytime I try to ?

Not everyone can make friends.  And since humans are made to have friends to survive, I guess I'm fucked, and honestly, I accepted the fact I'm just worthless to others. So please, don't give us miracle solutions on how to make friends, you can't. Just be lucky and make sure you don't try and make friends who will go out of their way to harass you until you wanna hang yourself and, judging by this species' intelligence, is a pretty common occurence.

Sorry for trauma dumping so much. But with no one to talk to and no therapist because my parents are lazy, this is my only place to open myself. Thank you for reading, sorry I'm not the person you want me to be society."
1,"I have just one friend & he comes over only when he's found out I cashed my paycheck. Sometimes I tell him I'm kinda' lonely & he says 'Yeah me too'. We play video games for about 30 mins, then he takes money out of my wallet & leaves."
1,"Duck me! Most wholesome video on the internet. Thank you, folks!"
2,I love this lol
1,"I just started high school a couple of days ago and I want to make more friends, but the school I'm going to now is super close to my old school so I know a large amount of the people there, making it harder to make more friends. Since my entire friend group moved schools with me, I don't know how to talk to other people because I'm just around the same people as before, and it's easy to talk to them due to the fact that I've known them for years. I want to try to talk to more people but I'm scared to, and the people in my classes don't seem like people I want to interact with, but a lot of them move from class to class with me. Does anyone know how to get around this? I'd like to have more friends than I already do because there are so many people in my highschool- over 1400- and I want to meet some of them. Anyways, if anyone has any tips to help, thank you very much."

1,Humans are destined to drift apart as people become more and more addicted to technology to fill those voids. Look at the direction just the marriage and reproduction rates are going in every developed nation.
1,No other channel will teach you how important friendships are and how to make them <3
1,"Friends act as extra variables in life, so I don't keep any at all. Family members present enough unknown variables for one life-time; adding friends to the equation is foolish in my opinion. I used to keep many friends, but as I became older and realised the larger truth about humanity; I began to find people's lives, hopes, and general thoughts tediously linier and boring. There are many people who are ascetically pleasing but few with strong minds; so it's best to continue observing rather than participating (until more begin to awaken)."
1,Kurtzgesagt Do you actually play Catan?
1,"I feel like this video doesn't take things like depression, neurodivergency, and just how _isolating_ our society is into account. All of these things have major impacts on one's ability to make and retain friendships!"
0,"""I think my biggest problem is that I love being alone but I hate being lonely."""
1,Loneliness is a pain that’s unexplainable and hard to talk to with people and the worst part is that it gives you too much time with your own thoughts and the negative thoughts always seem to win
1,Thanks… a lot. I probably would have spent a big chunk of my life trying to figure out how to make new friends and how to make friends without this video.
2,Thank you so much for this. I cannot express how much you have helped me.
0,"damn that’s crazy

still hate every aspect of my life though"
1,What made you guys come up with this particular topic?
2,Wow okay Kurzgesagt I come here to learn not to be attacked! J/k help me make friends! :(
1,"It is still too hard. Finding the time and energy after all the responsibilities seems impossible. Besides, adults tend to be way more cautious when meeting somebody new than kids or teenagers. Unfortunately, I spent all my young years deep in depression and work since my father abandoned my family. Wish I could rewind and be 14 again and talk to my classmates."
1,Oh. a new Kurzgesagt video-. Friends... uh yeah imma just assume myself that i have lots of friends
1,The animation style looks a little different then previously.
2,Having few friends is a good thing. The best thing honestly. But them being your *friends* instead just being 'friends' is not necessarily guaranteed. It's a gamble. But the pay off is definitely worth it

1,"With the U.S military life I’ve left my friends every three years, so I have to find new people that won’t screw me over. I usually make 2-3 good friend and 1-2 ok friend groups. This makes me see why military children are depressed. Also even in adults a relationship is out of sight out of mind mindset.

1,"Good video, but I am more interested in ""why one would need/want friends"" like the psychology and/or biology of it.

0,Okay but what if you just don't care? In all seriousness. The desire to have friends at all died a few years ago. Not even depressed or sad over it.
0,how the fuck did you know I don't have friends and I'm feeling lonely.
0,Why was you hurt me this way
1,It's hard for me to make friends because I rarely meet people that I actually like. It's been like that my whole life. Most people are just not good people. I genuinely don't understand how people can have so many friends.
1,"you become friends with ppl who are in the same frequency.

i especially appreciate the part about enjoying yourself. after i'd watched all the vid before it, i felt kind of inspired to go and devote time to social activities and invite people out, even if it meant feeling uncomfortable and torturing myself a little. this part reminded me that it's also important to have fun"
1,Error: Brain Capacity limit reached: Brain must be upgraded to complete task; understand how to make friends
1,"After reading a lot of the comments, the following poured out of me:

Not sure if this will resonate (or if it's even accurate for everyone), but I've found at least for me that the desire for friendship is just one of many interconnected needs/desires that we humans have but rarely explore to the their fullest and most satisfying extent.  My need for social stimulation can be effectively curtailed by (1) being the most supportive and sprightly person I can be (striving to make others', even strangers', lives a joy; this makes me happy and [I hope at least most of the time] does the same for others); (2) formulating and pursuing extremely challenging, satisfying, soul-expanding long-term personal goals/ideals (like living and thriving off-grid on conservation land, a project 11 years in the making and 4 years on the ground now); (3) envisioning how I can, making plans to, and actually acting on desires to create materials and meaningful systems that actively better my life and the lives of those I come into contact with (some in my workplace, some in my personal life; I've built my life around this mindset); and (4) echoing what was said in the video, taking an active interest in what others share with me and accepting them no matter how much I can personally resonate with what they said; taking #4 further, I also intentionally ponder how what they said could/does influence my life and make it clear to them that what they said is important and meaningful to me.  

I generally focus on making myself the best person I can be, and the rest gradually nestles into place.  I still have fewer (especially local) friends than I would like, and I kind of suck at prioritizing friendship maintenance (in some cases), but I see clear signs that these strategies make me attractive as a friend."
1,"Simple question, like if a friendship is a real friendship does it really require any efforts? It should become natural right?"
2,There’s a huge difference between alone and lonely.
1,"I love my friends but I hate relying on social media to keep in touch with them. And they're not willing to communicate with me in another way, so I guess I'll have to be by myself from now on. Good thing I'm really good at being alone. But I'll miss them"

2,I want to be your friend.
1,"Relationships are good if only correct

 Oftentimes, solitude is the best healthy option for your beliefs, feelings, and mental state

 In the Islamic belief, God made us different cultures, dynasties, and tribes for the purpose of (acquaintance), which results in good relations that end in marriage, an increase in knowledge and money, an expansion of the base of culture and the dissemination of religion

 Likewise, we find in the Qur’an - always - linking the word (most people) with an ominous adjective such as (most people are not thankful, most people do not know, most people are ungrateful...etc.)

 So if you ever think about being social, keep in mind that 70% of people will not be good to you, either in principle or in morals and dealing, and this is called a toxic relationship

 The correct relationship is (what benefits both parties and satisfies their needs without harm and not at the expense of anyone else)"

1,This channel is a gem.
1,"A big part of my life has been having to balance the two things that are most important to me:
My friends, whether they are old or new I realized that the people that I loved the most were them, and even though I have a slight case of autism I managed to maintain them through the years.
However I am also driven by my urge to avoid death, both in the sense of being forgotten, and achieving more so that my presence will be felt beyond my lifetime. These two forces often collide, for many times I have to choose between following my dreams and being there for the people that I love."

2,"Thanks Kurzg, The timing of your video seems perfect for me. Your video is going to make me reach out to some friends and reconnect with those I do care about."
2,"I lost my friends when we moved from a town to a nearby village. Since then I’ve struggled to make friends, because I didn’t really fit in at first. The only friends I’ve had since then were a few friendless people (for good reasons) and someone who turned out to be very self-centered. Because I’d like to have a close friend and they seemed nice at first, I stayed friends for too long. In all three cases I ended the “friendship” because they were wearing me down. REALLY nice people always seem have plenty of friends already and/or are too busy. I’m not looking for casual acquaintances, but a real friend."
1,"I have a saying, based on my 41 years of life experience and that most of it has had this experience throughout.

1,"I find the mention if spicy food funny. I'm the only introvert in my family, and also the only one that consistently eats spicy food. Spicy curry is a staple in my diet and I love shopping for hot sauce... alone. I think maybe it's more of a cultural thing and less an extrovert/introvert thing. Either that or I am an exception."
1,Commented here.
1,"What? face_with_open_mouth

""This is why it is so easy to form new friendships in school and university.""

Hahahahahahaha!!! rolling_on_the_floor_laughing That's the most stupid, delusional, unrealistic sentence I have heard for a while!!!

And of course, once again, no actual advice nor any sensible truth was given."
1,"I am very content with my friends. These people are incredibly important to me and I am more than thankful for them. What I notice quite often, however, is that a lot of people prioritise other types of relationships (family and/or romantic relationships) and therefore let friendships fall flat. I am aromantic, meaning I don't have to worry about romantic relationships at all and can put a lot of time and effort into friendships. But still, friendships are often seen as the type of relationship with the lowest value. Friendships, family and romantic relationships are fundementally different types of relationships that all work differently and should have the same value. Generally speaking, there is no most important or least important type of relationship. For many of people romantic relationships and family are the most important, but yes, there are also people to whom their friendships mean more than anything else."
1,"Car-centric city planning deprives easy accessible meetups and corporate mandates deprives meaningful interactions. You used to be able to just hang out on the street, walk to every store you would need, and know the workers and owners of the shop and where you work on a personal level."
1,Honestly I’ve always been lonely ever since my friend group went to different schools and now i only know one of them and the others well i knew since elementary school so it’s disappointing but i have made new friends but only a few yet i still am craving that feeling of just being inside a big group that always got your back and i just am unable to talk for long and i just cant hold conversations well you cant have everything right so hopefully i can change that
1,With me it isn't the number of friends being low causing loneliness it's how often Regular people aren't patient about communication with Autistic people so lacking the necessary stuff such as clarifications that could help cooperation.
1,"If you are feeling bad for failing in the US or other countries where people are a little more reserved, imagine me who failed pretty much all social goals in Brazil which is considered a super open and extroverted society, wouldn't even have a chance in any of those countries haha."

2,Who  want be my friend
1,"I'm lonely because I choose to be, unfortunately the people I need to surround myself with are all in a higher class of living and I don't have access to them, and the ones I would be forced to surround my self with (If I did try) would cause me to lose brain cells by listening to their drama filled bullshit lives. The majority of the population has an IQ lower than a tranquilized mattress."

1,I dont have many friends but im.fine with that i have my brothers  and 1 friend i know when we where 3 years old
2,"dude. it's like, i needed this lol. I've no frends at all"
1,My lonelier friends would be perplexed as to why I have so many friends. But they don’t realize I put I a significant amount of my time into my friendships. 80% of the time I am the one initiating meetings and I spend a good chunk of my day playing games and talking with them. At some point it just felt natural to create events because I simple wanted to spend time with them and they accept because they feels the same.
1,"Ah Yes, spicy food"
1,That's completely wrong for me. Most friends I got through sharing  adventures of youth or harsh times spent together. Socializing and spending good times works too but at drastically lower rates. I feel much stronger connection to people with whom I passed through some shit. Not just mingling at some party. Support to each other under circumstances means much more. Even if you're not meet often.
2,"I am not friends with anyone as I hate the overwhelming majority of people. Frankly, better this way too."

Prioritizing social connection all my life with the wrong people (so many of them) has left me emotionally crippled and bitter to the point that I am physically not capable anymore. I've decided that the pain of loneliness is the lesser evil, bcs I really do seem to attract the wrong people and all other ones rum from me..They probably see how broken I am face_with_tears_of_joyman_shrugging so yeah.. and 7 years of on&off therapy don't change nothing either.

1,"""Why u get no bitches and how to get some"""

1,"This... is a really difficult one.
By my nature, things and ideas are WAY more interesting than people.  It is a lot of fun exploring this with like-minded people... but honestly that is just a bonus rather than the main event for me.  It isn't that I am anti-social or anything.  I can (and do!) enjoy time with people... but I am often happiest when left to my own devices.

The real issue is unfulfilled expectations.  Expecting any kind of reciprocation that is then not received... putting effort into a relationship and getting nothing back... man... those are some of the loneliest times of my life.  But literally being alone?  I rarely ever feel lonely due to a lack of interaction with others.  I have a wife and kids, and coworkers... and honestly that alone is often too much for me to put any effort into.  The idea of doing additional things outside of that... that will have to be for another time in life, and even then I have a lot of projects and ideas of things I would love to do myself.  If someone happens to join me in those things, then great!  But I'm not going to wait around for people to come along into my life to do things with that I enjoy, or actively seek them out.

The problem though is seeing this in my kids.  My kids crave attention and friendship with their peers in a way that I don't remember ever seeing out when I was little.  So being a pretty hard-core introvert trying to advise kids who are not nearly as emotionally independent I feel a little ill-equipped to give them advice.  It isn't that I never had friends, I grew up in a very small town, so we all knew each other and were all up in one-another's business because you kind of had to be.  But in a modern setting where friendships are so much more selective and optional... I have no idea how to navigate those waters.  I simply didn't have that problem as a kid, and haven't sought out many new friendships as an adult.  I'm sure we will figure it out, and we at least have a much better home life than either my wife or I had growing up, so there is always that.  But if they want friends, then I feel like that shouldn't be a hard thing to provide in suburbia compared to my own rural upbringing, so I am a little stumped as to why it is so difficult."
2,"Something funny that happens to me is that I want more friends but I already have some, but I feel like I need more idk why."
1,"""Making friends in university is easy"" Dude, I went through five years of university completely friendless, despite my best efforts. School work took up way too much time as a science student, and unless you were into drinking and partying, there were next to no opportunities at my school for meeting people and making connections"

1,"This is so beautiful and society really needs something like this right now. Thank you Kurzgesagt, for making this move that creates ripples far larger than the first step.<3"
1,You teach me a good lesson thumbs_up
1,"My brain is wired so differently from normal I truly believe I may not actually be human. I don't build anything being around people, there are people I been around nearly 24/7 for years and we aren't friends AT ALL. I noticed they are more likely to use the term friend than I am, despite us not having anything in common. I make friends when I quickly identify what we have in common and deducing how friendly they are by looking at their relationship with others. Because of this I can quickly jump to ""best friend"" in a month making most people uncomfortable. 

So I play this waiting game as they spend more time with me to realize what I've known for months and by then I've shifted in thinking they are taking so long because they don't like me or see some flaw and so I increasingly grow more and more distant until once they are ready to be friends, I'm ready to move on.

The process people use to build friends makes no sense it's just based on time spent together which feels extraordinarily primitive. Probably why so many people with ""friends"" still feel lonely because their natural method to make friends is very very primitive and is failing. Internet help to find people like you, but then internet also makes people colder and less sociable. No winning."
2,Friends aren’t a necessity though
1,"What's infuriating about having to invest so much time and effort into cultivating and maintaining friendships is that the other person—who, statistically, has many more social connections than you do—has no incentive to reciprocate. They could afford to let you go and feel no less fulfilled in life. I used to keep all my friendships on life-support by being the sole person who texted or called them, suggested fun activities, invited them out, etc. Yet whenever I ceded responsibility to the other party, my so-called friend would wait months or years before reaching out to me. Often they had the audacity to ask why I was the one being a stranger. But if we're being honest, most never reached out to me ever again. Every friendship I ever held onto was wholly asymmetrical. A sham, one might argue. It makes me wonder: what is the point to any of it? Maybe I suck, or maybe other people suck, but it doesn't matter because trying to be friends with other humans is exhausting at best and heartbreaking at worst. The false promise of friendship makes me not want to deal with people anymore. The false promise of friendship makes me not want to deal with life anymore."
1,"as I start stressing about going abroad after graduating, kurzgesagt posts this video. I cannot express with words how much I love this channel mending_heart"
2,"This video is as released at the perfect time because I (and probably a lot of other people) just started going to a new school, so this was super helpful with figuring out how to start a friendship. Thank you!"
1,"Thanks @Kurzgesagt , I really need this as a student since we are back to face to face modality. Lost almost if not all connections during the plague... Very heartwarming, btw, new pin merch looks cute fr. See you all next time, Let's Touch Grass < 3"

1,"Quit social media, they're all selling you ""fake friends"", go out and make real friends. It's that easy, yet it's a lost skill haha for the modern people especially in USA/Canada."
1,"all of this makes me SO glad I only need minimal interaction. i haven't felt truly safe outside of my family for years, and crowds intantly cripple me in so many ways"
2,"i have autism and this felt like a little guide book, thank you"
1,"I appreciate it, but I don't need these videos to be made just for me."
2,"Having that one true friend, is more than enough. Especially when you have great parents, awesome siblings, and an amazing extended family. If you have that, you can have hundreds of colleagues and acquaintances. They don’t need to be “friends.”"
1,I'll just continue hoping that I don't need friends... because I don't. ^_^
1,"My issue is trying to find people who shares interests with me. I have some friends and am grateful for them, but it's always a little awkward to actually spend time together since we don't like doing the same things."
1,I don't have many friends. I do have around 5 persons as s friend  and almost everyday i contact them. I used to have many friends but most of them aren't good person. So i learn the hard way to avoid alot of people unless i know them very well and can be trusted by them.

1,"Getting Mimikyu vibes from this. It's lonely and wants to make friends so it dons the getup that makes it look similar to a Pikachu. A certain someone learned the hard way to not remove that getup, lest they be punished by death. Not to mention Mimikyu has one of the more busted abilities in Disguise which, together with the typing (ghost/fairy), stats, and moves, makes it one of the best Pokémon in competitive, especially in singles. Mimikyu has been one of my favorite Pokémon since it debuted in Sun and Moon, for those reasons. Not quite at Pikachu's level, but pretty close."
2,I love this channel so much

2,The problem with making friends is the human factor. Humans are terrible. No thanks.
1,"Thia really oversimplifies things. No one wants to spend in-person time with others just to 'hang out'. Everyone is busy, busy, busy.  Getting ahead, burying themselves in everything, but taking no time for friends."

1,INTROVERTS!! Watch this.
1,"I think it’s also very important to mention that it’s easy to think that it’s only you that doesn’t have friends or feels lonely, which could potentially discourage you. However, it’s the reality for many people so just be honest with yourself and take the leap of courage. 

Lonely person + lonely person = 2 less lonely people"
1,"My mother told me (when I was a kid): When you are single, your friends will tend to be single. When you are married, your friends will tend to be other married couples. When you have kids, your friends will tend to be other couples with kids the same age as your kids. She was right. Now I'm almost 50 years old, never married and no kids, and making new friends around my age is nearly impossible."
2,Just fell out with a good friend. Now I feel attacked.
1,Why am I crying
1,I am also a shy guy face_in_cloudsred_heart
1,"My biggest problem is that I'm new to a friend circle but I have had an annoying and childish impression infront of them, therefore all of them view me that way. If I try talking to them they would just talk to me for formality or some may even tell me to shut up and stop being so annoying and childlike. My bestie has got new friends so she doesn't even care about me. I used to be so talkative and friendly back then but now I'm not even willing to go to school....."
1,"I'm a senior in high school and never had anymore than 4 ""friends"" at once I got 1 semester left and if I can't make a lasting friendship, my fear is that I never will and if that's the case, vaping ain't gonna be the only thing taking years off my life expectancy."
1,I can't imagine the rage if this were posted in March of 2020.
1,"I joined my local French meetup group after watching this video and we had a really fun tabletop game night at a bar. We're meeting again next week.
Thanks Kurzgesagt!"
1,"I’m curious, I used to never want to be alone but now 3-4 years, all I want is to be alone, never go out anymore. Not depressed or anything either probably happiest I’ve ever been, you should do a video on people like me, loners"

1,"The last time I talk to my best friend was two years ago,but now we talk again through messenger but it's incredibly hard to fit on our schedules me being at school in the morning, and her being at school at night,and till this day she is my only friend."
1," Personal experience: maybe it does, but even then, that doesn't make anyone want to talk to you. This is a problem because, generally, people who never talk are introverts and usually don't speak unless spoken to. I learned the lesson of forcing myself to talk (it's best to wait a day, two days, or even a week to acclimate one's self to the people in that class), but countless others never will.

The lesson in this: talk to weirdos. They need you the most right now."
1,"Being ""alone"" is different than being ""lonely"", they have two different definitions but the word sounds similar. Someone who is very extroverted with a lot of close friends and connections could still feel deeply lonely inside. The video doesn't really mention this and so people will associate loneliness with being alone. Some people voluntarily choose to be alone and it brings them happiness and joy, while others involuntarily choose to be alone and they are dependent on people to bring them happiness (which sometimes it does bring happiness, and sometimes it doesn't). The people who have a lot of friends but still feel lonely tend to have a lot of inner insecurities and have not yet learned to become friends with themselves because they spent their whole lives dependent on others to bring them happiness and never really focused inwards on themselves."
1,okay now they r just roasting usneutral_face
1,"I had a close group of friends until everyone started settling down and getting married. Unfortunately the group did not work as well with couples and before long I wasn’t getting together with any of my friends. The arrival of kids made it even more complicated. Oh well, I am looking for opportunities to make friends now that I am divorced but it is difficult."
2,I love this video!
1,"Lesser the friends the better.
The people you need to be close to are your parents.
When no one will stand by you, they will."
1,"Thanks for the effort of making this, but I'm convinced I'll be just as lonely in the rest of my life which is pretty sad given that I'm only 20. I haven't had a friendship in 3 years now... and I'm not even exaggerating."
2,"Wow, this video spoke to me. Incredible."
1,"never had many friends, was a quiet kid without much interest in other people.
Its also problematic that i can sympathize and connect more easily with younger, female people than to people in my Age (be it males or females) :/ The age-gap is a threshold that complicates Friend-finding^^
My best friend found me in an MMO, she lives a few hours away. I actually found several really nice people via Games. They all lived far away so i couldnt really strenghten our connection ._.
Nowadays, i dont like MMOs as much as back then. Friends showed me big, good MMOs over the years and invited me, but often it didnt ""click"". The one MMO that i play quite often is Destiny, but i dont use the chat-system. Not sure why."
1,Kurzgesagt knows face_screaming_in_fear
2,Can you be my friend?
1,"Idk if I just started to notice…but I always felt like since my mom is an immigrant who is from Africa and left her home country to come to America for better opportunities and the first thing she told me is that she didn’t anyone and didn’t have any friends, money and a place to stay with..but her aunt was the only family member who lived in America at the time and fluently spoke some English. And the thing is when she first came to this country she didn’t even know English and misunderstood American culture. The thing she didn’t understand is what people were talking about and she only spoke French and her native language. And the thing is that my moms aunt told her to go to a school to learn how to speak a English at some Charter School. And she know practiced for years to better up her English. And then 2 years later she met my Dad who is American and spoke English. And the thing is he taught her about American culture and the English language. And she was a quick learner to adapt and understand why Americans love small talk because it’s so weird when I was in Europe everyone is not too chatty and some people on the streets ignored or didn’t greet you and that felt kind of lonely. But the thing is that since my mom realized I was a quiet baby but I did smile, giggle and laugh but the thing is that I was a shy child around people I don’t know and who aren’t my friends. 


So I just think the reason I suffer from loneliness and social isolation is my personality and my other past traumas which kept me closed off from my peers and very stand-offish"
1,"I choose to be lonely and I do not need any friends man_shrugging

Simples"
1,"What if others keep refusing to put as much effort as you into a friendship? I had many many mannnnny friends throughout my life, but almost always the friendship ends the same way, the other person does not stay in touch and I'm always contacting, inviting, preparing events for the other party, but rarely would that the other party reach out first to ""hang out"" or organize any event at all. Truly frustrating to try and make/keep friends these days, especially when you have little time/funds to begin with, let alone the other person never wanting to expand any effort to do their part."
1,"Thank you for the video!! Congrats on #3 trending!! I wanna share a strategy I’ve been using lately: not giving in to my “I don’t want to” thoughts. I’ve had a lot of anxiety in my past and stinginess and my current partner wants for me to be a more open person, so to do this I try to no longer listen to my “I don’t want to” thoughts.   This could help a lot with friendships WELL so long as you know your healthy boundaries I mean. Here’s an example:
A new friend FaceTime calls me, something I’m not used to as I mostly text. So of course I think “that’s weird I don’t feel like doing that.” But then I hear myself think that and I put that thought away and I answer the FaceTime call! Our time spent talking was short and not that deep, it wouldn’t seem like it grew our friendship but I mean, it’s better than not giving some time to that friend, as time spent together is what builds friendships! Also, by answering the call that signals to my friend that it is okay to call me, it’s encouraging her to talk to me :)
Give some of your time to people and don’t let yourself say “I don’t want to join.” Even if you’re awkward, even if you don’t know what to do, just spending time around people and making opportunities… this WILL inevitability bring you closer with them. And if they judge you for being awkward or shy well in that case they are not the right people to be friends with, they suck!! 
Have fun and do your best!!"
1,I agree with this video. I made some of my best friends recently thanks to just the fact I went to school with one person. From that we started playing DND this year and now I have an amazing friend circle that I really appreciate.

1,"this is so wholesome
i needed this a couple yeats ago but i figured it out myself so im good however even for me this was very informative
i really hope lots actually use this video as a loose guide for getting friends"
2,"I miss being a kid and literally having a conversation like ""Hi! Want to be my friend?"" ""Sure!""
What I've noticed as an adult is, the best way to form friendships quickly is by laughing together. Putting yourself in a situation where you can laugh, whether it's conversations, movies, or games, makes it much more likely to get that sweet, sweet oxytocin flowing."
1,"I'm an introvert, but surprisingly I actually have quite a few friends. I just don't have any close friendships. I am too nervous to actively contact anyone, so I struggle to build those close relationships."
1,"The fact you felt the need to make this video, and rightfully so, just shows how screwed up society is.

I can explain why this is happened and why its a thing and how society changed and way, but I can't focus my thoughts all too well.

Yo, Kurzgesagt, I want you to do a short interview with me about this and life and anything else really. I need people who can help me focus my thoughts and I am willing to let you work for me. I will blow your minds with how well I can actually think and the solutions I have. I am not very educated because the education system around me was ass, I was arguing with teachers at 7 years old, but I am very intelligent. 


No, this is not a joke. Challenge me, you vut joles. : )  (Spanish to English joke I literally just made up btw, let me know if you got it)

Also, if you think intelligence and education are the same thing, or if you think AI has anything to do with intelligence at all, you are wrong and I will recall the offer to let you work for me.

Again, I am being dead serious.

(Edit, I take back the offer after you told kids to hop into a windowless van.)"

1,"I've never had an intimate friendship pretty much ever. Even my own family members seem distant, and as I get older I find them fading from me. Any social interaction is just so difficult, like operating the controls on an aircraft. Whenever I try relating to people, expressing emotion or simply communicating it's like flexing a muscle in an amputated limb. And I don't even like niche, 'weird' things that would repel normal people. I just can't interact or present myself.  I feel like after all these years, all this trying to make any sort of connection I've constantly failed, and I fall into my own thoughts and imagination just as I did as a child. I fear God has destined me to be alone."
1,"I've been depressed and anxious for years now. Depression is vicious and it makes you not want to do the things you love or the things you need. And making new friendships is one of the skills that tend to get lost during a depressive episode. When I was younger I was really social and open, but now, after years of struggle, my social skills have taken a serious hit. It's become so hard and feels impossible, sometimes.
But if you're in this, too, believe in yourself. The best way to do or say things, in my opinion, is to start doing or saying it because you won't have a choice but to follow through upside-down_face
In conclusion : go gettem"

1,"I think there's 2 main reason for the increase in loneliness. 

First, in modern society we really have lost any reason and interest to care for most other people. The reason why we are such a highly social specie is because we are very weak and vulnerable if alone compared to most other animals. Most animal our size would be able to kill us easily. We evolve to care for each other in the savage wild that existed 5000+ years ago. Today, everyone is well fed, everyone is satisfied and can survive well enough on their own. More  people die from self afflicted addiction then any other external factors.

Second, this is not gonna be a popular opinion, but i don't think an infinite amount of culture is good for us. In today's world you can like the same style of music as somebody else, let's say metal music. You can still be in a situation were you dislike all of the groups the other person's like, even if you like the same genre. This is true for all form of media. We might pretend we want to be open minded and we just have to accept others has they are but at the end of the day, if we don't have common interest, we won't have interest in the other person. 200 years ago, you either like the music that existed in your community or that's it. Cultures were more homogeneous and people were closer as a consequences of it. This should not be seen as an argument against multiculturalism or having to accept other culture. my point really target all culture, movies, books, music, way of life, etc."

Except it also hurts because I've been wanting to turn that friendship with my closest friend into something more for years and I haven't worked up the courage to ask yet. I feel like I know her too well and know she's not interested in it. Heck, I'm afraid she'll somehow come across this comment before I ask her. I've lost track of how many years its been. At this point, it might have been a third of my life. I need to find a video from Kurzgesagt about these kinds of relationships."

They never reply back with something or talk to me About anything ever as if they don't even know me. This happens to me Everyday both in Person and in Social Media. Even whenever I fall in love with a girl I start talking with her or texting her she also does the same thing to me thats why I never had a girlfriend in my whole life and nobody ever Proposed me either and do you know what is the Worst part I know that even if you read this comment you will just ignore it and this comment will just be another piece of Writing that someone Wrote out of frustration and nobody Cares."

1,First
1,Can’t wait to see this on “kurzgesagt out of context 3”
1,"Speaking of introverts vs extroverts, can you guys at Kurzgesagt please make a video on one of Carl Jung's life's work about the 8 cognitive functions mentioned in his book called Psychological Types? These 8 cognitive functions are the direct source of the concepts of introvertedness and extrovertedness. But the two concepts of introvertedness and extrovertedness are not the whole picture, not even close. There are four other major aspects to the functioning of a person's entire mind which play just as important of a role as introvertedness and extrovertedness, which are the two judging aspects: judging vs thinking, and the two perceiving aspects: sensation vs intuition.

The things that got Carl Jung thinking about and forming these concepts were the many bits of knowledge about anthropology, literature, sociology, philosophy, and psychology. He noticed how many specific religious, philosophical, and political groups that formed from the collecting and uniting of people under certain attitudes, group each following similar patterns. He noticed theories from philosophers and psychologists in the past who had made introspective but incomplete observations and theories about people's temperaments and personalities. He, as a psychiatrist himself and the founder of analytical psychology, noticed the many different approaches different people have towards life and the different aspects of life they prioritize. He noticed the different ways by which people expressed themselves and aesthetics they produced in poetry, books, etc. All these pieces of information about humanity came to themselves together in his mind, they crystalized to form amalgamations and ideas which he eventually refined into specific, well defined theories about the key components to different people's different ways of functioning psychologically.

21 years after the publishing of his book in 1942, Carl Jung's work was adopted by Isabel Myers Briggs and her mother Katharine Cook Briggs who wanted to put these 8 psychological types to practical use as a personality typology system. They developed what is now likely the most widely respected and professionally used typology system: the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (aka MBTI). MBTI has since been in further development and has even been integrated into the workplace with companies using it to understand where their employee's strengths and weaknesses lie.

MBTI has cultivated a huge and highly enthusiastic community which, thanks to the internet, has exploded in popularity in recent years. Sadly however, like with every other means by which people can use to discern one another, MBTI has been used by many as a means to discriminate, have prejudice, and create biases for and against different types of people. This problem has resulted in the tainting of and increasing toxicity within the MBTI community and in the discouragement of many from joining and supporting the community. The source of this problem is that these people do not actually understand MBTI and Carl Jung's 8 Functions very well if at all, as well as the fact that the majority of people within the MBTI community are intuitive types (a psychological type mentioned in Carl Jung), resulting inevitably in a dominance of those types within the community. The reason for why the intuitive types compose the majority of the MBTI community is that intuitive types are the minority of society as a whole, hence they find security and a sense of identity and belonging in the MBTI theory and in a community of types like themselves. 

Carl Jung's theory of 8 psychological functions and its Myers-Briggs Typology adaptation are a subject which I believe everybody should be educated on. This subject has the capability to help everybody understand themselves and understand other people. It could give everybody a strong sense of identity, a thing which people have always needed since the beginning of humanity and which is in great need in modern society. It could give people give people a means to see the world differently and more importantly, see the world in the world in the eyes of others they might otherwise be unable to sympathize with. Most importantly, it could give people the tools to know what parts of their psyche they need to develop, which parts of their psyche need to be monitored, and which parts of their psyche they didn't realize they were suppressing, all important information which can help people know that they are unhealthy and immature in areas they would otherwise not have known about and to know how to improve in those areas to become the most mature and healthy version of themselves they can be.

You guys at Kurzgesagt I trust to be able to take the this subject and spread it to others in a good manner. To be able spread it with accuracy and care. You could be able to not only improve the MBTI community but to bring attention to an amazing theory with so much promise to so many people across the world. I hope that you will respond to this idea with the enthusiasm to make a whole video, or possibly even a series of videos on this subject.

PS, you guys defined the differences between the introvert and the extrovert in this video in an impressive way that is more so accurate than most people's understanding, however with my current understanding of the concepts of introvertedness and extrovertedness, it wasn't perfect.

To be introverted indeed does not mean to be shy, and although it is similar to being stimulated more so by a calmer ""inner world"" of introspection and gradual change, the true definition of an introvert is a person who prioritizes his own psyche over the influences of the external world and as such prefers to try and change the objects and people around him to fit themselves and/or their own understanding.

The true extrovert doesn't necessarily have to be exceptionally charismatic or outgoing, neither does he necessarily have to be stimulated by the exciting and ever changing outside world. The extrovert is somebody who prioritizes the external world over his own psyche (contrary to the introvert) and as such prefers to change himself to best fit the objects and people presently around him. In the most simple terms, the introvert is characterized by subjectivity while the extrovert is characterized by objectivity."
0,if you are lonely you are not alone
1,5 million people came here because they were lonely
2,"This was literally posted a few hours after I had a discussion with my friends on how I basically have no life with no friends, no chilling, no free time."
1,The YouTube algorithm made me a offer i could not refuse
2,It’s kind of sad how many views this has crying_face
2,oh now thats my kind of video thanks guys <33
1,"I’m starting high school tomorrow, all of my old friends are going to different schools than I am and I’m super worried about it. 

The fact that you posted this today of all days seems like a sign that everything’s going to be alright. Thanks for the advice :)"
1,"

Kurzgesagt:Football

Americans: uM aCtUalLy ThAt'S sOcCoR"
2,Hope this helps me making friends :) great vid
1,Thank you so much for this message. I can’t imagine the weight of the impact this channel holds.
1,"I know kurzgesagt is not a self helping channel and it's great to watch videos of you guys. 

But I have a question. I have a problem with oversharing and it's often stronger than me. What should I do? If there is anyone with verified psychology knowledge I'm willing to listen."
2,Yeah this just made me even more depressed about my loneliness lol
0,Personally attacked me
2,ok this is getting too spesific
2,I'm an introvert that LOVES spicy food :P
1,This animation is absolutely beautiful
1,"""go to places that feel comfortable""
""where there are people""
My brain: you get to pick _one_"
2,Very helpful.   Thank you
1,The intro tune at the end was a nice touch
1,"Wow, hit me right in the heart, beacuse im in exactly this posistion right now."
1,"They also use the same soundtrack from 'loneliness' video 
I like this soundtrack"
1,"I try all the time to reach out to people, invite people over to do fun things like go out on the boat, etc. All I get is shot down."
1,"I used to have a facebook account and was connected to real people I really knew in real life. But when I sent messages just to say hello or to ask them to something fun with me, I even didn't get a reply. When it was my birthday: nothing. It was like I was a ghost to them. When I saw these people coincidentally in a bar or in a store I asked them if they got my messages and they came up with all kinds of excuses why they didn't answer. So I started thinking about my life and my ""friends"" and came to the conclusion I had no friends and so I ghosted my complete social network; Best decision ever! I kind of restarted my life from scratch and though I still have no friends I'm quite happy by myself knowing there is nobody to make me feel like shit. I'm in total control of my life now."
1,I felt very alone when I moved to a different town but I’m very lucky that I found a great group of friends
2,"It all depends what kind of friends they are though.. There are the toxic ""friends"" who only want to put you down and make you feel inferior, and there are the *true* friends which only selflessly want the best for you and you for them, uplifting you when days are difficult and have a balanced friendship with each other."
1,Make a video about Andrew Tate!
1, *Would the sympathy happen in online communication?*
1,I watched this video but I still have no friends. Except for that person in the mirror.
1,You should make a video the future
1,"There is an ever growing group of invisible lonely people. People who live alone, go to work, and do very little else.
They might live away from family, and their original school friends.
Often they simply lurk, never engaging with anything or anyone, even online. They just observe.
I know this because I am one of these people. And the fact is that we would all get along terribly well with each other, if we just had someone/thing to drag us together.
I've often thought that there needs to be more active effort to reach out to lonely people. Relying on critically lonely people to overcome their own loneliness is like trying to pick yourself up by the bootstraps.

I'm not really sure about what I'm trying to say, but telling lonely people to just ""fix"" their situation alone (lul) is not a good answer. I am however glad that we're accepting that loneliness is a major issue."
1,This vid the reason u got no friends behehe
1,Friends arent real thats something that only exists in tv shows and movies
1,"I hear how a lot of people are suffering from loneliness, but it doesn't look that way when you go outside. Everyone gives off ""stay away I've got better shit to do"" vibes. Maybe they're pretending because in today's culture you've always got to have something going on, or maybe this just says more about me lol.

I guess my unqualified advice would be to make sure you're not sabotaging yourself. Don't act opposite of your goals and then be sad about it in private."
1,"I spent 4 years in grad school with a class of about 100 people and didn’t manage to make a single lasting connection, other than through social media. It was an excruciating yet interesting social experiment because I feel like the group was too big to make meaningful friendships, but too small to maintain anonymity. I spent most of those years avoiding people in the halls and worrying about where to sit. What the hell is my problem…"
1,"Thank You for advice, man. It's really hard time for me; new school, my best friend just moved out forever. Im shy, and it' really hard for me to make friendship. I always was scared of being lonely. Thankfully, this video popped up on my main page. I really want to test it in real life, now only thing left for me is to break my weakness: being shy. Thank You again, and keep Your work up!"
1,"=DESIRE TO HAVE AS MANY AS POSSIBLE OF SO CALLED FRIENDS ARE ACTUALLY A SIGN OF HERD INSTINCT BEEN TAKEN A LEAD ROLE IN PERSON'S BRAIN  WHICH ALSO LIES IN UNDERDEVELOPMENT OF COGNITIVE FUNCTION TO TRIGGER A PACK SURVIVAL STRATEGY...

.......THE OPPOSITE IS ALSO ISNT GOOD,SO THE BALANCE IS NEEDED,BUT IT'S ISNT NORMAL AS IT'S ABOUT TO NOT MAKE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANYONE"
2,This was such a cute video! LOVE THE TOPIC AND APPRECIATE THE EFFORT HERE. Thanks Kurzgesagt!
1,"This is something I have been struggling with for many years. I've lost some great friends so many times that I am deathly afraid of trying to make new relationships. I keep myself in a bubble and avoid people because I don't want to get hurt and I don't want to hurt others. It feels safer this way. But most days it is lonely and I feel like I am missing so much. I am not exaggerating when I say I have no friends, because I truly have nobody but myself. I believe it's better this way, to be alone, but sometimes I don't think it is."
1,"But what if only you are focusing on your friendship you always calls them for hangout but they never call you you always see there stories with other person 
F**k this friendship shit people are not real"
1,So u mean it was easy to make friends on school? Damn xddd
1,Hello Kurzgesagt I have a question I would like to propose a meet up in my country. Could you put this meet up in the index of the sub reddit?
1,"""I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?"""
2,This is a good video
1,I have never felt as personally targeted by a YouTube video before
1," wait holy crap thats whats happening with me, i legit never talk but everyone treats me really nicely"
1,"Just now I've made my first friend in many years. Feels like I've been dehydrated for years and finally got a glass of water. Over the years you forget just how much it hurts to be alone, and I've finally remembered. I'm honestly stunned people take this for granted."
1,I had this problem for a long time I couldn't solve it so I gave up and this problem makes other problems start spreading in my life like cancer making me deeply depressed that I become toxic and infects even the closest people to me which made it worse until I became ostracized by my family I even go on surviving a life for the day I die
1,Don't be a weirdo. It's that simple.
1,Why have I just cried at a Kurzgesagt video?
1,"One of the few friends I do have recommended this video to me. As a 31 year old working full time, I’m lonelier and more friendless than I’ve ever been. This video was timely. Thanks for posting… and to all of you in the comments, thank you for being willing to be vulnerable about your struggles. Sharing your experiences inspires people all over."
1,"So 30+ year olds are doomed because they're no longer forced into shared experiences with others like school. And those that failed socially in school have a 1:10000000 chance of stumbling across someone that likes weird movies. So many people, so much sand."
1,Did- did kurzgesagt really just tell me to get a life?
1,"1. To find a friend you want, you need to be what you are looking for; this also applies to relationships. There needs to be congruence between people for the social fabric to knit well between any two humans, and the closer the commonalities the stronger the bond. Do *not* make the mistake of trying to take a person you want, and bending them into a shape or type that you desire; this almost never works, usually backfires hideously, and almost always results in a chimera of an ideal that *will* force you to both regret your work, and eventually abandon them. 

2. To be alone is not the same as to be lonely; being alone is a choice, and one can as easily un-make that choice at their choosing. To be lonely is actually the key sign of depression, and might itself require outside aid just to overcome. Mental burdens are hard to have alone; do not make the prideful mistake of assuming that you either do not need help, or that others do not wish to help. Whether that be medical, psychological, spiritual, or otherwise in nature, please for the love of all that is good seek help if you genuinely cannot make connections. 

3. The good news is in a world of 8 billion, the odds are damn good that others exist who also wish to know you. Go find them."
2,I like the way you explain life. It`s like gentle parenting.
1,"i have anxiety and afraid to talk to new people and stuff but my country is so free and happy that people always ask me how i feel, just a simple thing like that keeps me going"
1,"Apply this to family relationships, which I believe are vastly more important than friendships.  Not that friendships aren’t important; but family relationships usually tend to be stronger, more long term than most friendships."
1,No. Back to the usual programming. Thanks.
1,What if I have a horrible personality and no one want to deal with me
1,"Damn my hobby of 12 years is pretty niche. Collecting vintage equipment. 10 years ago their was no trend, 7 years ago collecting vinyl was becoming popular, 4 years ago collecting cassettes and VHS tapes was becoming a trend. 2 years ago the resurgence of cassettes and vinyl in the modern world had been finalized. People are just getting into reel to reel but it won't become a trend or popular anytime soon because how expensive it is. I started in 2013 and people just saw all of this stuff as junk, collecting CRT tv's or monitors was a sigh of relief off peoples backs, ps1 and ps2's were a dime a dozen, retro gamers were not very popular at the time where as they are today. During my high school days The only friend I had was a guy named Ryan I knew all the way back from 2008 and we still talk today although I'm 800 plus miles away from him ever since I moved away from home. He looked at my hobby of it just being something I do for fun. No one until discord came around took interest in my hobby and even still people take one look at the pictures of what I own and either give me an answer of ""holy shit that's so much old shit"" or ""why so much junk?"" Criticism is something we all have to deal with but it does tend to hurt a little when people don't understand the background of what I do. When I get stuff from people off of offerup either for free or for some time of payment say like a Reel to Reel or TV I ask about the background and the owner usually says it belonged to their dad or grandfather which has passed away but really enjoyed that item and took care of it. They also say they want their stuff to go to a good home which will have the same passionate person to do the same and that's where I step in, I give things a second chance to live by wither continuing to use them or repair and then use them that way that's 1 thing less going into the landfill. With all that being said everything I have collected have become my friends, these items are always here for me and I know I can rely on them but human interaction would be nice, being almost 25 years old and living in new state for the past 4 years I have made 0 IRL friends and the only people I have met that have taken interest to what I do are on VRChat or discord and those people are always hundreds or even thousands of miles away. That's my take, the older you get the harder it is to make friends and it has an unfortunate impact on your life if you don't have some type of human contact depression and annoyance sets in and you eventually become numb to the feeling of both issues. VRChat has a good outlet and I spend countless hours on their meeting and talking to people but once that headset comes off my face reality sets in and once again I fell lonely. If you are between the ages of 12 and 20, try to get out there and make some friends because you never know when you'll really need someone's shoulder to lean on and cry about life and things."
1,"I moved 1.5 hours away for a job 5 years ago and that was it. I never heard from any friends again. At first I put it down to different schedules, but then I realised that the moment any of them had the chance to not know me anymore, they took it. Now I don’t mind so much, because I have a really involved med sci job that takes up my time, but damn it hurt so bad at the start. It’s not that I got used to the loneliness, it’s that I made friends with it. I can better manage my expectations, and I know not to rely on other people anymore. I would rather bleed out than ask an old friend for help. Being alone isn’t that bad, you just have to accept it and work with it. A gym routine, cooking new cuisine, a pet; all ways to work your alone time for yourself."
1,"wanna know the sad truth, capitalism has pitted us all against each other for so long we are now nothing more then competing slave units and our masters are happy as we make them money and fight amongest ourselves for their enrichment and our impoverishment."
1,"""Do things for yourself, without expectations."" Quote of the Decade"
1,Do you read minds
1,"This is obscenely good timing Kurzgesagt, I'm literally just about to start college (to get more knowledge) and none of my current friends are going to the same one as me."
2,"I like how I’m being subtly called out by kurzgesagt for being lonely and not having any friends. I mean, it’s very convenient, but I feel like it’s a sign."
1,What a video bro! Can't thank you enough! Thank you so much you made life so much easier!
2,I love this video
1,I’m not lonely just crazy isn’t that right carrot
1,"I tried finding a meetup when this came out but I just live too rurally and its maybe the best argument for me moving to a city, just being in a place its possible to find friends"
1,I saw a Jurassic park and Star Wars reference in  
1,"I don't have friends , only people who uses me for their benifits smiling_face_with_tear"
2,No thanks ; I'd rather prefer to die sonner than having to have friends moai
1,"""...that's why its so easy to make friends in university..."" This is the biggest lie I've ever heard."
2,The wormhole pins are super cute!
1,I swear the channel name changes some of the letters every week or so. We need an in a nutshell video on how to properly pronounce the name at 20 million subscribers
1,"Idk I prefer being alone without anybody
I'm wierd I guess"
1,Let’s see if we can get through a Kurzgesagt episode without them promoting climate alarmism!
2,"I have few friends but close ones.
I've lost my best friend a few months ago. The thing I regret the most is that I had not the chance to tell her how much I loved her."
1,Introverts dislike spicy food and extraverts like spicy food? This doesn't sound particularly scientific...thinking_face
1,"Solving loneliness is not about how ""we"" should change, it's about how ""environment"" should change. 
How to change the city so that the social spaces are not replaced by roads and cars. 
How to reduced city population mobility so that the people we meet on the streets are not strangers that we could only meet once in our life.
How to reduce average working hour so that we have more time for social activities instead of overproducing meaningless product.
How to reform the capitalism government so that we value personal well-being above profit efficiency maximization.
However I do believe we should keep exploiting people to keep the economy growing, because we are achieving so much great things. What's the point of making a sustainable and boring civilization? Human will extinct eventually, so let's focus on what we could achieve before we die, instead of worrying about when we will die or worrying about the human suffering required."
1,"Ahhhh, now here's a video for me :)"
1,"i am lonely and the things he says that i could do to get friends, i cant do them because im only 13 years old so i cant go to the movies or go on a ski tour what should i do?"
1,"Everyone mentioning how covid ruined their social outings.

Nothing changed for me, except a climbing gym I go to closed for awhile.
I am fine with being alone, it is not the same as lonely though, If you can't be comfortable by yourself, maybe you have some inner turmoil to workout."
1,*Companion
1,I needed this
1,youtube just roasted me by recommedning this to me and i don't know how to feel
2,just the video i needed lol
2,be yourself
1,"I'm an introvert, and while I don't usually like talking to people, I've found myself wanting to more ever since lockdowns."
1,"Friends are the spices and herbs of life. Doing things alone just tastes bland and boring, but doing things with friends is bussin."
1,Been about a year since this video was released. No improvement so far in fact I have digressed won't stop trying tho
1,Kurzgesagt is out to save and educate the world one video at a time
1,"Nice video, for me it doesn't work because I got tired of this, it always ended up feeling like I was forcing something and when I stopped chasing they just went away, so I just quit trying and accepted the fact that I should focus on me and learn to do everything by myself, it's a learning process but when you get used to it it's fine."
1,Early asf boi but I should be studying  atm :(
1,open up are really hard for me because thing happen to me in the past make me have trust issues
1,"Well, reporting my experience from the battlefield: It was a complete failure for me. I didn't make any new friends, but only some enemies, because the group I ended up with is composed of a bunch of social freaks who don't have friends because they lack the necessary social skills to have them in the first place."
1,The title came for my Neck.
1,"""life long friendships that never happened"" I felt that. I had just transferred to a Cal State University, and I had a lot of new friends, but we lost contact after Zoom University started. Our bonds were barely forming and broke easily"
1,"I've realized that now I'm extremely fortunate to have the social circle that I have, a social circle that I did not have in high school. I'm also realizing that in order to keep this up after college, I'll need to work on maintaining these friendships in an environment that is not as conducive to retaining friends, namely work life."
1,"Not only did they tell you the science, they finish with an event to get you started. Legends."
1,We've been summoned here to be trained to do the impossible. Let's atleast try mates raised_fist
1,Capitalism inhibits friendships and human relationships.
2,"Dudes... thank you you really help me with this tips.
Thanks and god bless all krusgezgat team"
1,"Making friends is not as simple as this guy is making it seem. It all depends on what kind of person or people they are and their personality. There's people that are *warm hearted* that will welcome anybody with open arms (you'll have to be lucky to get them) and then there's the people that pick and choose with who they want to be friends with and are very stubborn (also very toxic). I've mostly experienced the people that are very stubborn or are judgmental. I have huge social anxiety/trust issues because of past trauma and making friends with that condition is not easy. I normally have to get use to being around a person's presence  before I can fully open up to them and they have to put in THE effort to get to know me aswell, otherwise it won't work! But I don't bother because most people are very impatient."
1,"Sometimes what is more tireying is when you are the one making that first step, you are that one friend calling and making things happen, makes you feel like the other person isn't as interested ir invested in the friendship as you think"
1,"The issue i have with my social life is that i look very unique and usually get made fun of by my body shape. im sort of like an introvert mixed with an extrovert. i do get a lot of exercise, but people assume im a person that just stays inside all day eating chips and drinking soda."
1,Even the channel that produces and disproves existential crises is telling me to get some friends skullskullskull
1,"I really can't connect with this video. I want less friends and am frustrated when they keep inviting me to events. Feels like a chore most of the time. As George Costanza once said, I want to be forgoten. 2 drinks per month is more than too much."
1,"I have a request for Kurzgesagt.
Please create a video of how Environment effect the IQ of a person."
1, till  if this video came out 8 years ago with those terms the comments would be full people calling the creators nerds. but now a days they are fully accepted. how times change
2,This video is for Giyuu fans
1,Just got ratioed by Kurzgesagt
1,Damn......this video hit me in the feels.......
1,My bestfriend left me for a girl and i had only one friend and now i have non pensive_facepensive_face
1,Okay... so... what about romance?
2,"Me watching this with many friend groups and some really close friends

1,Since when you moved from interesting science videos to boring vids. Should I unsub?
0,Still don't have any friends but thanks for the video anyway
1,"A person who can't be alone, can't be loyal, can't be honest and can't be anything"
1,Ah~ Finally a content that i Need in my life :D
1,What did this channel devolve into? For real.
1,As a lonely person this video just made me angry tbh.
1,i feel slightly offended when i opened up my pc and this is the video that was open lol
2,"Remember

Having a thousand friends is a few

but having one enemy is just too much


Good luck victory_hand"

Everybody gangster until the kurzgesat duck turns into a space marine."
2,This has been the greatest video ever
1,The hard truth is the older you are the less friends you will have. Kids take that up. Work takes that up. Etc
1,"Ok, I thought about something right now... I ended my only friendship today and now I want to sit somewhere different in school. There is this one group of funny people... Maybe they would be happy to sit with me :)! I don't know! I hope they'll like me red_heart. But even if they don't, at least I'll know then that they don't match with me! loudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_face Wish me luck 'v'"
1,"I have one friend.

They live 7,000 km away. Living their life. I'm alone but I am not normally lonely."
1,"I have a grand total of two friends. Which is fine for me. The level of commitment that we have between each other are not that intense, but it's not that weak as well. I prefer having time for myself and I would much rather not be ""surrounded"" by friends or anyone. So this video, while i think is very useful for people that want attention and want to be ""needed"", is not useful for me."
0,I'm not lonely and I don't want to make friends.
1,This is horribly naive and downright insulting. Why is it that everyone is so busy? Perhaps address that?
1,"School and university are the best places to make friends, try to talk to the cashier in your neighborhood (invite them to a poker night), churches and social services are excellent, library and book cafes are awsome."
1,Woooohhhhh! This video will be going up like a rocket in getting thumbs up rocket
1,"Only seen the first 14 seconde and it feel out of touch. Sorry but no, my friend didn't give me all of that. Sometimes I give all of that, by now, me neither."
1,In México Mexico is so easy to make friends! come visit us smiling_facewaving_handif you come the first round it's on me jaja
1,bruh youtube really recommended me this
1,I had a friend move to a big city but end up confused why he wasn't making friends. I told him he has to go out and meet people.  I know it was hard for him and I tried to convince him to look up local game shops and find gaming groups but he just never did. Now he's moved to a smaller quieter town and claims to be ok with being alone but it's pretty clear he is still pretty lonely.
1,bro how u know what i need
1,Went through college without meeting anyone so yeah
2,We should not just be having friends but GOOD friends who have good character and believe in a true God (Allah)
1,"Check in with your friends fellow kings. Remember, steel sharpens steel."
1,Social anxiety and lack of communication skills makes it difficult.
1,this is too unreal sorry
1,this is explained in such a good way for people who are neurodivergent/autistic. really dig this video
1,"I feel lonely but I don't want any friend. They are all a**holes. Ended my years long relationship just because they're jealous. Betrayed me countless times while I never get anything good from them. I was always the one to help them whenever they need help, only to get stabbed in the back. Now I treat everyone as a potential enemy."
1,Very good point about acquaintances. That's exactly what I struggle through.
1,"I went from having a huge group as a teenager, to a much smaller group in my late 20s and now after the pandemic i have 2 friends. Iv moved twice in the the past 5 years too, from my home city to another country and then back to my home country but a much smaller city.
I feel pretty lonely, but then alot of people i know feel the same way. I think social media has made people LESS social not more. Gone are the days where you would rock around to your friends place unannounced and the same for them turning up at yours. Everything now is a text message on a screen and people not hanging out because everyone shares their lives on social media anyway.

Saddest thing iv seen was my incredibly popular older sister become terminally ill and then die a few years later. Of her friend group (id estimate 20 close friends) only 1 was there for her. The rest sent a message on facebook once every 3 months and thought that was enough. 
It really woke me up to how fickle modern friendships are becoming. Do we not care about each other anymore? why is everyone so cold and judgemental. It wasn't like this in the 90s and 2000s, but its gradually got worse over the past 10 years or so. Also the political division is off the charts and slowly starting to boil over."
1,I hate family reunions. I talk to them out of convenience rather than finding the need too because we’re busy living
1,This came a year lateloudly_crying_face
1,"one way to form strong friendship is to start acting like you are already frds(not with strangers ofcourse).. they will reciprocate faster. For people like me who have anxiety, we wait around for people to come to us n often hold ourselves back thinking "" i m not saying that.. i dont think we are close enough to say that.. "" etc. so a key is, dont over analyze, just go with ur instincts. Dont hold urself back."
1,This really hit me. I feel very lonely and empty in life. My issue is that most people are so surface and self centered even though they say other wise. I think its hard to find real people in todays society. The sharing thing scares me as people are always judging and are not compassionate enough. This life is so hard and I just want to hit the 3x fast forward button just to get to the end.
1,"I went to a meetup from the Reddit threads! It was a blast. Quite literally, we had a watch party, and some people came with giant telescopes. So we watched the past, and it was a great time. Thanks, uncle Kurzgesagt."
1,It's easy talk to people don't worry about what they think hundred_points
1,"Here you go guys, how to start making friends "
0,Bro it's Tuesday why are you attacking me!?
1,"I'm just crying, my big dream is to improve the world and you guys are doing that in every video, every video that get published it's an improvement for the world, who knows how many people will go out and make some friends after this, who knows how many long life relationship you have just created. I love you guys, thank you so much."
2,"
...Well, _shit._"
1,"As I grow older, being outgoing and taking initiative in social situations becomes easier, yet I have virtually no patience for other people whatsoever. Just because I understand how to do it, doesn't mean I enjoy it. Most people are just not for me. I cut off many friendships in 2020 and have barely tried to find new ones since then, because I just know it's going to be an endless cycle of meeting people I end up not liking, repeating the process of making meaningless small talk then going our separate ways. And I'm 25, so it's definitely a little late for me to be making new, meaningful social connections while most adults are sitting comfy in their friend groups they've had since middle school or earlier."
1,"This couldnt have come at a better time, with me just starting high school at a new school where a lot of my friends arent going"
1,as soon as I saw the title I clicked... damn
1,"Social media was a mistake. We were never meant to live in a global society but in vibrant, close-knit villages."
1,"Bro school just started for me, are you watching me?"
2,Ok that hit differently
1,I really need this because Everyone at my school is being a jerk to me because of my skin color
1,Wondering when Kurzgesagt became my therapist
1,"I halways feel like I'm the only one hoe try to keep a friendship alive. I'm the one hoe is calling, inviting or go see someone. It's hard to keep up when you feel like your frienships are one way. That's why I feel lonely most of the time. Because I don't feel like my friends see me like a friend."
1,I have autism and I have hard knowing how I should start a conversation with someone who I don't know what they like. This has led to me not really talking to people and thus I don't really make many friends.
1,"It's already so hard for our cavemen/village-people-wired brains to adjust to the present-day environment where you can have hundreds of ""friends"" online but barely know your next-door neighbor. Adding to that, the cavemen/village brains were wired to have basically the same group or a few groups their entire lives, but now, people move so often that it's really hard to keep strong friendships going in long distances. I wish the video talked more about these challenges."
1,I am 38 and I don't have a family or friends. Only my cat as company. Its not that bad when you get used to it. I don't know how to talk to people and lost my job due to a traumatic incident so I barely go out of the house anymore.
1, Can I know list of diseases?
1,"I really didn't know how much i needed to hear all this. For the last couple of months, I've felt my friendship with a guy from my school was somehow fading away: he would not wave at me or we wouldnt be able to talk as we used to. But, for sure, the advice in this video has given me a new point of view to my situation, and I am truly grateful for that <3"
1,"i dont need friends, I have myself and thats alll i need."
2,I want friends but I'm ok alone too!
2,wow kurzgesagt knows me so well!! just right in time ;__;
1,The world always feels brighter after a Kurzgesagt video :)
1,"I dislike other people. If you are unable to be happy by yourself, then it is unfair to have kids."
2,Any friends in the comments
1,"man, this is me in a nutshell right now.....feeling so lonely and so out of it to the point where i want to attempt.....life is hard.....life isnt for everyone....i found that out very quickly and it sucks"
1,“being physically present in a class a lot without saying a word makes others more sympathetic to you” does not apply to me at all
2,I kind of knew some of these tips but it does numbers to be actually told. Thanks!
1,"On the topic of maintaining friends, I have found since turning 30 the best thing to do is plan out the next time you'll see someone as you're hanging out with them. Everyone's super busy but looking at the calendar and picking a weekend, activity, or a day while you're talking face-to-face makes it a lot more likely that that will happen. Even if that date is a month or so in the future. And taking the opportunity to reschedule then and there if things are canceled instead of letting it linger.

Things were a lot easier I feel like when you're younger and can do more ad hoc things but with work and everyone having kids it really does take planning to maintain friendships now."
1,This channel never fails at making quality content
1," "" .... and it's not just you."" it is funny because there are currently about 7 billion people on earth but we don't have enough friends.
 ""studies have shown that new friendship can develop quite quicky,weeks after you meet someone."" yes but study also have shown that we tend to form a lifelong friendship with people that we acquaintance when we were young."
1,That TikTok dance was particularly well animated.
1,bro you called out your whole audience
1,one thing that really helped me was joining apps focused on making friends such as guestmatch. people there have been pretty open and friendly in general and its just an easy way to start talking to people without too much pressure.
1, i really like the kingdom hearts reference smiling_face_with_heart-eyes
1,"I really needed to see this. In retrospect, I was always the quiet awkward one who never truly fit in with any friend group. Then the pandemic forever changed my entire life for the worst and disrupted my path for years to come, both my journey through uni and beyond. Recently my best mate harshly criticized my inadequate social skills, tendencies, and personality, causing me to doubt/question every single friendship and taint every happy social memory I've ever had. Despite my self esteem at an all-time low, watching this gave me hope.

Edit: Until I can support myself and become a patron, thank you Kurzgesagt for reviving my curiosity and optimism in the world, when 2020 saw everything fall apart for me and nearly finished me off as well. Give your ducks a big hug for me <3"
1,"Wow, this actually made me cry...

I am currently 15 and will be turning 16 in november, however I don't think I've ever had someone I could call a true friend. I really enjoy talking to people from my class, but we never hang out after school. This is mainly my fault since I spend most of my time in my room, playing computer games, and nobody in my class plays the same stuff as I do.

So watching this video really hit me"
1,I don't have friends because I can't stand entitled egocentric biased idiots called millennials. I'm one of them but I don't know why I never found myself sharing their interests.
1,"why are you lonely : less money
how to make friends : more money"
1,"A rather complex topic laid out really well, cool stuff!
Friendships are so very important for our overall well being. It's something that I've been missing for some time now. You do get used to a severely reduced social circle and the bonds that do remain just get stronger, which is great, but finding yourself less able tot maintain friendships like you were used to is still a pretty hard thing to accept at times. Still, above all, personally I'm just grateful for all of those good friendships I've already been blessed with throughout my life and it's never too late to make new ones. Past the feeling of loss, there are still great times to look back on."
1,This video appeared to me just after I had a talk with my mom about me being lonely smiling_face_with_sunglasses
2,"Ok so now we have a video about getting friends, when will we have a video about getting some bitches"
1,"Yeeaaaa unfortunately most people are either too busy, mean, annoying or racist. face_with_tears_of_joy I guess I’m here to be alone."
1,"hey guys, I would really love to see a video about overfishing if that's ok with you?"
1,Well the timing of this video couldn't be more accurate
1,The fact that this in my YouTube reccomendations says something about me
1,"This video is wonderful in so many ways, including reminding me of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Don't Panic red_heart"
1,I don't even relate to this but kurzgesagt is always a banger
1,"""Just be yourself bro"""
1,"These videos make me feel like I'm not alone! I've gone through some big friend issues this past year, and this video is so nice! I'll definitely be taking this into college with me!"
1,I think Kurzgesagt is trying to tell us something thinking_face
1,"Remember, everyone wants a friend and everyone feels hesitant. Everyone wants to talk their heart out and everyone is shy. Everyone wants a small group to hangout with and everyone feels afraid to initiate. Every friend that has ever been, was a stranger before. If you receive a smile, smile back. Know the boundaries, don't be a afraid. Live."
1,"I'm currently going through a depressive period that made me realise how lonely I am. After watching this video I come to the conclusion that I'm not getting new friends any time soon. :( Basically friendships work when you have a reason to be in the same place at the same time with someone. That's very difficult to do when you live in a rural area that doesn't have many activities available and you're a very introverted person that doesn't enjoy small talk with strangers and actually needs a reason to connect to someone. I don't see how I could get any of that where I currently live. The current model of society destroys people like me. Everybody minds their own business, people move to various different cities for job etc. Everything changes so fast that it's really difficult to stay in the same space with anyone and how do you even stay connected to your old friends when your life experiences differ so much. Without getting shared experiences continously, maintaing friendships is almost impossible to me."
2,"Thanks, i needed this."
2,This rly give me hope
1,I lost all my friends bc my first friend like he just left for no reason and then i met a new guy and he semd nice but now he has been on vacation for 2 weeks and he does no longer talk to me :(

1,Ik I hit rock bottom when I needa watch thisskull
1,"Yeah, the thing is, I don't really care for or much like, me. I'd rather no one else reeeeaaly does either. IRL, anyway. If I think you're starting to think I'm cool, then the cold, distant weirdo has to come out to make you think, I'm not worth your time. I'm far too disengaged with reality, that nobody should have time for that. This is my choice. I accept it."
1,"I have made 3 battle brothers and they are eternal, unlike friends"

2,"I needed this, thank you Kurzgesagt!"
1,"I learned the hard way in highschool that to make friends, you have to be willing to sacrifice your freetime and be willing to go a bit out of your comfort zone. I don't like parties, loud music and drunk people, I'd rather play a board game with a few people I know. So I didn't really have any friends back then. But in highschool a friend invited me to a party anyway, I went and afterwards I got two close friends I still talk to and a few hang-ons I like to check up on. They have asked me more than once ""how come we didn't notice you till after the party in our second year?"" If you are in the same situation, you really ought to bite the bullet once in a while."

Anyway, great video as always! This channel is simply amazing"
1,"This is really great timing to post a video like this. Many people are heading back to school/college, and lots of them (including me) have been starving for connections. Thank you for educating on the subject of friendship and psychology. It can really help."

0,am not lonely
1,"I’m alone because people are manipulative, backstabbing assholes. I’d rather be alone than deal with their treachery anymore."
1,People are fortunate if they have found a long time friend.
1,"Honestly, just put yourself in a situation where you are around people, whatever it is in a college setting, in a library, cafe, bar, club, waiting on an airplane,  etc. and just talk to people.   That's a start.  If you are want to enter a group of people's conversation, listen to what they are talking about and make sure they aren't doing anything important.   Then enter the group's conversation with relevant dialogue."

1,I just bought my first merch for me bff partying_face
1,"Simply terrific yet pretty shocking that you had to make vid about ""how to get/keep friends""."
1,Awesome man I am so glad that you made this video on right time
2,"Where most make mistakes is in focusing on the quantity of friends they have over the quality of friends they have. 
Having a single friend who’s loyal and caring beyond compare is a lot better than having a dozen who’d all stab you in the back the moment doing so becomes convenient to them."
1,I expected someone to make a joke about this in the comments
2,God this is how I felt all throughout high school and few years after. I always had only one friend from elementary and middle school. I started thinking I just want more friends and wanted to be a bit popular. I just wished I wasn’t so shy in those years.
1,"Wow. So much seen through rose colored glasses. This is the textbook ""My arm hurts when I do this -> so don't do it"" solution to friendships. And this certainly didn't cover abuse, dishonesty, and exploitation. Very disappointed of this presentation."

1,"Since graduating from college and moving across the country, I’ve really struggled making new friends in my area. I work from home, too. It’s challenging."
1,This video was posted just when school starts after corona
1,"that little easter egg of using ""the tail end"" in music is so perfect.

Edit: So just to expand on current thought:
The reason why its perfect is that it can symbolize ""the end"" of being lonely or friendship. Or a sudden hint of posivite vibe from it, and making little mistake than symbolizes the ""tail end""."
2,"As someone who lost two best friends in the space of a few years (RIP), I say cherish whatever friends you have. !VERY IMPORTANT! I wish someone told me when I was younger about allies, adversaries, enemies and finally friends. Learn the difference. Many people I know are allies, but they are not friends. Be kind, do your best, cherish what you have, find friends in the activities you love. I wish you all the best."
2,"Living closer to someone

Look for people who have similar interests

Care and share"
1,"This post feels like a God-send. While most of the people here might be post-college, I just started college a month ago in a place 50 kilometers away from decade-old friendships and relationships. While I do have people I can laugh and talk about school with, I do feel like I am not a ""good friend"" or ""best friend"" candidate for them.
My parents and family say that relationships will grow with time, but all of my friends or acquaintances seem to have already built stable friend groups and I feel like I cannot wedge myself in. I feel like school and dorm living take up all my energy, and I seriously cannot understand how others seem to find so much time and energy to spend with friends. Not a day goes by without a moment of alienation. 

This video gives me hope that I won't spend the rest of the year or 3 more years here feeling this way."
1,"Romans  states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans  states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell."
2,"get more friends..
ok now I suffer from nicotine and alcohol addiction"
1,"Kurzgesagt, I'm genuinely curious:

How do you believe this video would apply to virtual reality? How would some of the core points change, and would it make it better or worse? Would it make it better having immediate access to someone who you can share the illusion of proximity with, and who shares your same interests, or would it be better to have someone close by who only shares some? How would some of the main challenges and benefits stack up comparatively?"
1,"First! and finally a video, I waited so long."

2,"What a great video Kurzgesagt! I am sure that every person who watches this video will know how to find friends and maintain their social relationships. Soon, they will be truly happy with those they consider friends and those who consider them friends."
1,I came to make peace with the fact that not everyone is made to have lots of friends and life is experienced differently by people. It's ok to be alone tbh but it's important to not feel lonely. Personally my faith in Jesus Christ cured my loneliness.
1,"Do people really feel this lonely?

I don't at all. I feel it's so easy to make friends, but feel little need to have many.

This is not a brag, I'm probably just a messed up person."
1,"Because capitalism alienates you not only from your work and the product of your work, but simultaneously also from yourself, and your entire species (that is your friends, your enemies, your mum, your dad, your kids, your neighbors etc, etc).

Marx writes that in a society where people spend their lives producing commodities (i.e. use values produced not for their use, but actually just for exchange) the commodities begin to take on the aspects of people and relate to each other as if they were people, while the people…take on the aspect of commodities and relate to each other as if they were commodities."
1,I'm 26 with chronic anxiety and major depression. I yearn for friends but socializing takes so much energy because they stress me out so much.
1,Don't you think it is kind of a shity feeling always care about the other but to never be the one who someone reached out for to make the friendship continue to be always the first to talk and always about the other one and he don't act for trying to sustained the friendship only you and if you won't do anything no one will ?
1,3 million lonely people watching a video about how to make friends.  Too bad we all can't be friends.

1,"I fell in love with someone for the first time one year ago and on our anniversary, a few weeks ago, we broke up. And I realized that I’m completely alone, because I placed all my eggs in one basket, I thought that just because I found love this person can be my best friend forever and I don’t need anyone else. And now I’m heartbroken AND I can’t even get any support or distract myself because I didn’t try to make friends with anyone else. Lesson learnt"
1,"""Called Out"" the video."
1,I'm so close to giving up. I'll be alone forever.
1,"Real friendships require real conversations, real advice and sometimes telling a friend what they don't want to hear. I see lots of ""friends"" who mindlessly cheer each other into bad decisions and allow them to do foolish things in fear of being seen as not supportive. Correct your friends when they are doing wrong, support them when they are doing right, be happy for them when they are doing good and cry with them when they are in a slump.

The Prophet of Islam said ""give victory/support to your brother whether he is wronged or the one doing wrong"" his companions asked ""how do we support our brother when he is the one doing wrong?"" The Prophet replied ""stop him from doing wrong, that is how you support him""."

1,"I am alone, but not sure if I’m lonely. The most I think about it is when I’m doing something and I think “man, I really need help with this. Too bad there’s no one I can call.” But I regard this apathy towards human connection as a symptom of my complex ptsd—ptsd that results from long term trauma/abuse. In a lot of ways I don’t see other people as safe. I mean you can’t blame me, my closest inner circle used that closeness to harm me over and over for decades. So I make the connection that by extension I should distrust anyone who has the opportunity to get close to me. Close = danger in my mind. I know logically that not everyone wants to harm me, and on the outside I do act and appear cordial, but I am constantly running “vibe checks” against others as a measure of keeping myself safe while also refusing to offer anything about me that can be weaponized. It’s an exhausting way to live, which is why I prefer to spend time alone. Rarely, very rarely, when I’ve spent time with someone long enough and I know that all the checks I’ve run are clear, do I start to make friends. But it takes years of being in another’s presence for that to happen, and that is much rarer in the adult world than it is in school.

For now though, I just want to focus on healing. It’s harder to be present when your mind is overrun with flashbacks and your sleep is constantly interrupted by nightmares. Even harder to talk about your past and your life when a huge portion of your memories are missing, but especially so when people I’m just trying to bond with candidly ask about my family and what _wonderful_ things I must do with them like every person in society I’m told does with their family. I know they do not mean to hurt me but these things that are so commonplace and ordinary for everyone else _do_ hurt me deeply. As an honest rule I’ve adopted to accommodate people like me who maybe haven’t had it so easy, I just don’t ask about the past or what they’ve done or what their family and friends have done. I inquire about the present instead—hobbies, interests, music, career—what they like about life right now."

1,"I already spend my life alone in the last 3 years, my social interactions are mainly just with my brother. Sometimes when I think about it, it's just depressing, I'm very introverted socially but I don't expect it to be this bad. 

Sometimes, I just recall my memories in high school to cure my loneliness but that just about it. That 3 years was the moment when I didnt have any meaningful life. Now, I am just a loner that can't even hold a basic conversation and too afraid to meet people my age."

im sick of being backstabbed or rudely interrupted at a pivotal moment or w/e callous things that happen.
im tired of it so i dont bother anymore.
having friends sounds like its healthy but without blaming others maybe its the type i attract or allow to be close; however i dont honestly feel like its my fault when other people are selfish."
2,I have that craigslist add “looking for a friend”

I’m glad to have new better friends now and I hope I’ll be with them for a long time, but getting to know people was tough.  The anxiety of meeting people is really worth it, so *please* go and talk to people even though it’s hard. Get someone to help you if you can. Good luck, I love you and you got this heart_handsyellow_heart"
1,"This was an amazing video to watch. I'm in week 3 of my freshmen year of college, and I've always had difficulties making friends, and this video will help me a lot.

Also, I hope everyone who sees this has a great week!"
1," - ""This is why it is so easy to form new friendships in school and university.""

Easy? I didn't do very well with making friends in school, so this isn't good news for me. And  didn't apply for me either as I was always the silent one and there was no sympathy, lol. Suppose it's not the end of the world for me, though, as I have been sitting comfortably without friends for at least 7 years by now, so I guess I shouldn't worry. Hopefully it won't come back to bite me in the future."
1,"1. Proximity is king. When you spend time with people at work, school, sports clubs, parenting groups, faith community, volunteering etc. this is prime ground for forming new friendships. If you want more friends you may need to put yourself in a new space, ideally one where you will be doing something you enjoy and therefore spending time around like-minded people.

2. Friendship takes time. You will need to invest time in forming a new friendship and in maintaining existing friendships, even if it's just a quick text to check in.

3. Make and accept invitations - to lunch, a movie etc.

4. Show caring and interest. Find out about what is important to your potential new friends and what's going on in their lives. Listen, ask relevant questions, and follow up later. Be willing to share about yourself as well. Look for signals of engagement/disengagement to know when to share more or less.

5. Be interesting and genuine. Do stuff you love and invite others to join you"

1,"I personally feel like one of the biggest problems for me when trying to make friends is that the genuine interest needed to create that intimate connection is just not there. I'm only trying to make friends in order to ease the pain of being alone without actually wanting to BE a friend. Its selfish and I feel like I should change it, but even after years of psychological therapy i have not been able to :c"

1,"That part about caring and sharing hit the nail on the head for me. Sometimes my conversations are more like interviews of the person I'm talking to, and while they connect with me I don't connect with them. I think I need to be more open and not afraid that people will find my life boring. I mean, their lives aren't boring to me so it can't be that bad."
1,Before watching: its because I don't go outside because I'm depressed because I don't get vitamin D from the sun because I don't go outside.

1,"Tbh, my life has always been like that. I don’t really have friends, i can’t go out ‘cause my mom thinks it’s too dangerous. I’m constantly on my phone ‘cause that’s the only way for me to escape that reality. Deep down I feel so badpensive_face."

1, That facial expression on the right made me laugh more then it should of.
1,"It's definitely much harder when you're out of school, or don't share a schedule and environment with other people, plus when you have family responsibilities and lack of time and freedom. Basically it all goes downhill once you're out of college/uni, where even old friends get married and have kids and are too busy and exhausted to hang out. I can't blame them either. And getting older makes your circle smaller inevitably. Now meeting new people is a challenge, but doing so on an ongoing basis and trying to hold on to some of those burgeoning relationships can be tricky, especially these past two years where everything got messed up. I am not sure what the solution is, but I do relate even as an introvert. I don't really have the time or freedom to simply go out and meet new people. That freedom is long gone."

2,"Friends is like having people that care for you and there to protect you and the biggest and hardest part of friends is finding the right one that does not take advantage and leave you a wrong path its your choice to find the perfect one for you.

1,"For those wondering :  Solitude isn't necessarily a bad thing either ! One can also bceome addicted to social interactions, leading them to be utterly terrified at the thought of being on their own ! And therefore becoming dependent to those around them... This is arguably scarier than being on your own, and yet, it's a danger that not many people talk about...

In Letters to a Young Poet by Rainer Maria Rilke, Solitude is described as the most important value a human can experience, a harbour from which new ideas shall stem as well as a sincerer dance amongst the vast stars of our cosmos ! (It is beautifully described in detail, please give it a try ! Sadness is also redefined as being essential to our well being ~)
Andrei Tarkovsky, as well as many many others, also suggest alone time : especially for young people. 

Don't forget that excessive social interaction can also be a dangerous drug ! 

Hope this helped someone out, take care and stay true to yourself and what you want. Not what society demands ^-^"

1,"From extensively studying the subject of connectivity, here is my theory: 
Proximity, Values, Similarities and Social hierarchy, in this exact order are the best predictors of whether a strong long term relationship can be formed. 

Those factors bond us, and assimilating those in peoples demeanour will help you create and strengthen connections that really matter.

In more details:
Proximity - exposure and quality time spending with a person. 
Values - sharing the same or similar principles and perspectives on life. Putting Integrity vs. Status pursuit first can distant people apart. 
Similarities - Having similar interests, experiences, beliefs.
Social hierarchy - Based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs if you are trying to fulfil your basic needs its harder to connect with someone fulfilling their self actualisation."

1,"this is a long shot, but it's worth a try. just a call into the digital void... is there anyone there? you wanna be friends? I feel stupid reading my own words, but... face_with_tears_of_joy like I said, worth a try. 

I'm 14, I love dogs and strange late night conversations, I'm someone who tries to always be there for people but when I turn around, I find that there's often no one who remembers to care about me. I dislike small talk and long for authentic connections, I think we're all broken inside and the scars are what make us beautiful. but I'm also a self proclaimed idiot... grinning_face_with_sweat 

a random quote: ""you say you're not special because the world doesn't know about you, but that's an insult to me. I know about you."" -- the fault in our stars. So yea, you can call me sentimental, sappy even, but im also a little crazy. (a lot crazy). a caffeine addict, I love the outdoors, bit of an introvert but I don't seem like it on sight. 

So I'm not sure why i'm writing this. I guess it just seems ironic to me, that so many people have watched this video because we're lonely, but no one seems to have considered that maybe a friend is waiting to get to know us in this audience of lonely humans. so this is just a call, maybe someone will answer. maybe not, but I tried. red_heart love you all,

1,"There is another, slightly more Nihilistic way of looking at lonliness.

Do not continue reading this if you are feeling lonely, and cannot take it.




Loneliness may actually be an evolutionary pressure, to select the next generation of humans.
In the past, we had pressures like extreme cold. This cold was not comfortable for almost anyone, but we humans adapted and became stronger. 
When there were severe food shortages, our species was on the edge of extinction. While our competitors chose to eat more grass and leaves (higher quantity of low calorie food), we focused on dense meat, and used fire to break down the bonds and allow digestion faster.

Loneliness is similar to this, except it is more of a psychological trial than a physical one. Currently, we are facing this evolutionary pressure, but we shall overcome this too. 
Our species will become stronger than ever."

1,I have social anxiety and was bullied for 7 years and i dont have many friends because i overthink stuff and i keep hearing bad stuff being spoken about me making me feel really badly. Thanks for this video it cheered me up knowing i might have a chance but sadly i don't think so.

All i have was bullies and because of that i have fall a grade in school one time and had to repeat a year. I can't talk to anyone unknown in real life. It's not like i have not tried but i just can't open my mouth in public. If there is any short cut other than talking, being social and spend time with my class mates so tell. And anyways i don't need friends anymore my school life is going to end in 1 and half year so. Ya at this point i am ok"

2,thank you for the video. After watching the video i reached out to some of my old friends and they all appreciated that I reached out and reconnected. I will break out of my shell and initiate more interactions for sure :)
1,"This is great, but I feel that it doesn't really acknowledge the growing percentage of adults that are happier being alone. 

My friendships are very loose at this point, and while I would feel sad if I lost them I don't think I would feel any great impetus to replace them.

Life gets too busy, and often times it feels like we don't have enough ""me time"" as we age. Combine that with an increasingly polarized society, and the prospect of investing time and energy in people more generally becomes a dubious proposition to a lot of people when weighed against the comparative comfort of retreating into yourself."
1,I didn't feel lonely at all before watching this video but now I just do.

1,"I'm pretty content with my friendships for the most part, but what this video made me realize is that I don't think I can handle making new irl friends for a while. The way people have responded to the pandemic has kind of ruined my sense of trust. Even a lot of the suggestions for activities here I'm definitely not interested in from a health risk standpoint. Most people are 'back to normal' now even though a very contagious virus is still going strong and continuing to mutate. I just can't."
1,I think the killer is how most unaffected people don't know anything about this! Big societal issues become issues because they are talked about and the thing is that loneliness is never talked about because the affected don't have anyone to talk about it to! Good work Kurzgesagt!
2,Cool!!

I never meet anyone; when I do the things I enjoy (cycling, running, weight lifting, archery), I never even see anyone else my age doing these things. I even moved to a bigger city once, the thought being there'd be more, different kinds of people, but I didn't meet anyone there, either. If I try to talk to people at live music events, the conversation doesn't go anywhere, and I never even made friends playing online games."
0,I hate being so lonely loudly_crying_face
1,"It's super weird that this video does not mention one of the greatest historical locales where friendships were developed... places of worship. Synagogues, meeting houses, churches, mosques, temples, and other places of worship are generally places where one can most reliably go to meet up with people who have shared values. It also helps jump start friendships as these are often organizing sites of volunteering opportunities, social hours after worship, and for contributing to one's community, and often even sports, all the activities that were suggested as good ways to meet friends. 

There are socially liberal religions if people have been alienated from a church or faith community. Unitarian Universalism for example is a very accepting and liberally minded religious community that is without harsh dogma or creeds believing principally in our individual search for truth and meaning and extolling respect and acceptance of one another within and without our faith and their life journeys."
1,"Despite this being still a good channel overall, i feel with the last few videos that as the quality of the animations went up unfortunately the quality of the content is decreasing, this video for example while not being a bad one i feel it contains very little actual information and a lot of obvious things are said in place of where it used to be educational content.
Maybe they are becoming more ""mainstream"" and making content that is easier and simpler to understand is their new plan."
1," Is that inspired by the Silent Princess flower from Breath of the Wild?
Or maybe it's a real flower. I'm not a florist so I'm not that good with flowers lol.
I have people who say they're my friends and shit, but even when I talk to them and they say they are there for me, they rarely ever respond. Like on Discord I have a friend who I've sent a total of 44.2k messages, but they've only sent 8.6k back. And it's usally just responses to my messages instead of like me where I talk about everything because I want to share my life with them.
Pretty much what this video tells you to is ""just go out"". If only it was that easy."
1,I just lost my last friend because they couldn't understand that it requires a little effort to maintain a friendship. I got really tired of feeling like I was just there for convenience
1,"I love this channel but i feel like this video missed the mark and was just a huge generalization. I think you should be careful posting videos like that, they can do more harm than good.

The biggest mistake in the video that comes back over and over is that *you* should approach, invite, talk and open up to your friends. What if you never get approached, invited, spoke to by those friends ? Are you supposed to just harass people over and over again? It gets tiring to always be the one to make that effort when others never do."
1,Your video is very relevant and quite informative! Thanks! <3
1,And yeah thank you nutshell I was suffering from depression this video made me a really happy to talk to my friends again since my depression kept me in I didn’t talk to anybody or seen anybody except my family for a really long time so this made me a able to talk to my friend thank you really really thank you I might donate
1,"Putin probably wached this video over 50 times

Edited: me as well"
1,"Alone and lonely are two different words. Some prefer to be alone and they can really carry themselves that way. However, we have to understand that our race is a social one. We cannot live without each other. There are many studies about how prolonged isolation and not talking can alter our brain. We cannot fight that biological change so folks, its good to keep a friend or two just so your brain can retain its sanity."
1,"I know longer know what does it mean to have friends. 
I move in the US during middle school and thought it would be easy to get to know people but it was harder than I thought, since people already have some established circle of friends.
So, I waited. I thought that once I get to college, I’ll probably find some people who I can relate and be friends with. However, people have their own priorities. It was hard to make friends. And, when I transferred to a university, I though I’ll make some good friends, but, then again, students in my class pretty much have their own circle of friends already. Most of them also leave as soon as class is over, which leaves not much room for interaction. Also, most of them also bond via parties and drinks, which is not my cup of tea. I’m more of a cafe, art, and relax kind of a person. I'm also an introvert, who turns extrovert only with those that I am really close with.

I always wonder how should I make friends because I don’t know how to. I don’t want to pretend someone I’m not just to attract people as well. 
It’s really easy how to tell people “how to make friends” but it’s harder than it seem in real life.
It’s hard for me to do small talks. If I would talk, it’s mainly just about school and studying. Other than that, I don’t what else to talk about or how to open a new interesting topic.

I'm okay with being alone, but I can't deny that there are times in which I wished I have some friends.

I hope I can find some friends that would appreciate me for who I am. I hope you and I could find friends that can appreciate us for who we are, without asking more than what we could offer."
1,"Kurzgesagt: If you suffer from chronic loneliness you can...
Me: ...find some help.
Kurzgesagt: ...watch the video we made about it."
1,"I'm an agoraphobic.
I havent been ""outside"" in 7 years now.
Outside being past my garbage can, and even then, it's rare for me to be out of my room for more than an hour a day.
I can count on 1 hand  how many times i have left past that ""safe"" zone. It's 4.
3 of them were to the doctors. One of them was to the vet's.

I have no real life friends that arent immediate family.
My mom is the only human interaction I have for weeks... even months at a time.

To say I am lonely is... an understatment.
The problem is I am scared as hell to make the change to fix it due to how many times I have been  beaten, abused, neglected.. just.. so many horrible things and I dont know how to cope.
I live off of scraps. Denied  disability for my mental and physical issues. I have no access to meds. The government just... forgets about me. 
I am invisible.
Unwell.
Lonely.

Every day I think about ending it. Me.
It.. has become so common that I have no issue talking about this anymore. I can tell strangers that I want to end my life. That I have a plan. That I am a single bad day away from doing it. I almost did not 2 weeks ago but failed.
No therapy. No nothing. Cant afford it.
I need help but i dont know how to go about getting it. Any time I have it has gone massively wrong.

I dont know what to do.
Or how to do it.

Lonliness is... the worst thing in the world.
I wouldnt wish this on anyone. And it is really sad that so many in the comments are saying similar stuff to me. We are all suffering on our islands. Some self made. Some forced. But all the same... it's not okay. 
I wish you all the best. I am gonna keep trying for as long as I can..."
1,"This is good advice but also completely stupid. Any moron can make friends under the right environment, an environment where there are like minded people that you can spend a lot of time around. The problem is unless you are wealthy these environments are becoming extinct in our society. The housing crisis, high rents and stagnating wages has made it almost impossible for many people to establish long term relationships with people, especially young people. I lived in London for a few months and thought that that lifestyle of working till you drop, spending more time travelling to see friends than actually being with them and not being able to save any money was completely insane. The data is showing there is going to be many many more victims of loneliness in the future and I predict suicide will become endemic among the young. No amount of advice or support can stop it because the problem is lack of housing/money plus the way society is structured where people and companies are forced to compete with each other rather than cooperating for the wellbeing of others."
1,Why are Kurzgesagt videos always perfectly timed. I’m not sure if it’s a coincidence or if I should be scared
1,"I don't have many friends. Maybe 1 or 2. And trust me, I have all the time in the world do other things. No time to study? Barely any time for anything? Cut friendships. The fewer you have, the more time you can spend on yourself. Then friends will come to you naturally"
1,"I want to challenge the study that shows being in close proximity equals in getting friends. I say this because the study is looking at gaining friends, not the adverse effects of sharing space. We could also conduct a study how proximity causes adverse effects such as bullying, difficulty of fitting in etc. Which we all know happens in schools and workplaces where forced close proximity is occurring.

Humans are their own worst enemy and personally knowing very many social people, very few actually feel being friends with hardly anyone, but describe as going through a socially acceptable conformity masked as 'friendship'

As for building relationships, it is obvious that humans being social, is being a requirement for bonding. What I did not like was the way the study was being used as a blanket proof for something obvious, when we can easily get a different result by doing another study from a different perspective. This is a well known issue of studies even when scientific methods are used in an attempt to limit the amount of bias and subjectivity."

1,What a beautiful video. This channel dopes not disappoint

1,I'm not lonely but I'll give this a view
1,Yo what if I'm an introvert that loves really spicy food??
1,the only negative point in this marvelous work is the weird and ridiculous british accent that your narrator has.
1,Those Kurzgesagt style 40K minis are adorable!
2,As someone who has pretty much abandoned his own friendship network in favor of his (ex) love and her friendship network i can safely say: never ever do that. Real Friendships gonna last longer than any love could. Friends are family you decide to have and its very lonely if you loose them all because of 1 person. Never let a man of a women decide who is your friend and who is not.

2,wow the soundtrack is so catchy like fr
1,I just finished a Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Group specifically for Social Anxiety and Panic Disorders; this sounds like a lot of this advice came from similiar literature. I wish this would have come out while the group was still running since we liked to share things like this with each other.
2,I absolutely love being alone but I don’t like feeling lonely.
1,Introverts: impossible.
1,This art style only works for birds. With people this looks like the corporate LinkedIn style. Didn't like it at all.
1,"I though this would be instructions on how to make a friend, as in construct one. Downvoted for clickbait."
1,"Wow. The way I was just having a mental breakdown on this last night. I thought I didn’t care anymore since it’s been more or less like this my whole life. But I guess I really do. It’s crazy how things come in perfect timing. It’s amazing.

Edit: the sympathy part when we are in groups for a long time- seems like I’m even excluded from that rule LOLLL"
1,"I had 1 friend or 2 in my lifetime…
I don’t want to make people suffer anymore because of me. Now my only friend thats with me at all times is the darkness inside me. I do not feel lonely tho…"
2,I sent it to my girlfriend. Lol.
1,"Human beings are hardwired to harm anyone insufficiently like them. The murder of Ahmaud Arbery is a perfect example of this. Behaviors like the belief in ""White Supremacy"" are core, typical human behaviors, as false as the idea of ""White Supremacy"" is. People will look for any excuse to justify their own behaviors and identities by declaring all behaviors and identities unlike their own as _bad_ and needing extermination. I have suffered exactly this bloodlust from others my entire life; I have not been able to make a friend my entire life because everyone sees me as an inhuman monster on first contact, no matter how well I behave. People hate me simply because I'm not enough like them, and the continued estrangement makes me even _less_ like them, growing that hatred until it becomes uncontrolled rage. It is literally no longer safe for me to be in contact with people for any length of time unless the other person's behavior is constrained by their job; meeting people just out-and-about is like meeting a tiger in the jungle.

Most of this video assumes facts not in evidence. It assumes that human beings are more tolerant of others than they are, to the point which would make the Nazi movement _impossible._ One cannot reconcile the very false ideas in this video with the very real hate movements that have existed throughout human history."
1,This video makes me feel so much better and positive
1,"Okay, I feel motivated to put in more effort and stop isolating myself from the rest of the world. Looks like I’m on the right track.

Its not a hate on video, that video is perfect. love Kurzgesagt"
1,"The truth is , you don't need too many friends .."
1,I just recently chose a new job because of the social circle problem. I'm 27 and almost all my co workers were either 40+ or 14-17. It sucked lol
1,"The Rapture is coming soon! The Rapture is when Jesus will take all people who love Him to be with Him. It will be unexpected and sudden. Repent! (I will try and Repent too) and belive that Jesus died on the cross for you, and trust in the blood of Jesus Christ and you will be saved. The only way to be Raptured is  being saved through Jesus Christ. After the Rapture there is the great tribulation in which God dumps Judgement on the earth and you don't want to be there. I pray that you will be saved in Jesus name."
1,"This struck home so deeply. I've been trying to prioritize friends more than even homework or sleep, simply because I'm afraid of losing them. But the part where they said ""on average, most people have fewer friends than their friends"" is SO true! I've always felt awful about this, but now that I know that this is simply due to statistics (and the fact that friend groups are built around central hubs), making me the _norm_ not the _exception,_ flipped the way I view myself on its head. Thank you so much for this loudly_crying_facered_heart"
1,"I just want to gush abut my favorite nerd things sometimes, but I'm afraid of public discords. I join them, get verified, grab the roles, then say nothing.

2,Thank you for adding the music. It really helped underscore the importance and beauty of friendship
1,"Yep, once I started working after university, it was all downhill from there. Work and travel to and from work take up so much of your life, it becomes very difficult to naturally find yourself in these situations. When you’re on a train to and from work and everybody is exhausted, nobody wants to be the person trying to strike up conversations with strangers. Then you go home, too tired to do anything else, only  to repeat the next day. I also noticed it more towards my late 20s, once a few of your friends start settling down and decide that they don’t want to do anything any more, all of a sudden your socialising happens one on one with them, instead of going out anyhere. so your ability to meet people via other people get even more limited. Whereas in your teens and early 20s, most of the new people you meet are by extension through other people when you go out  or have activities, because everybody invite everybody else along. I’ve been really trying to make a new effort lately though. Fundamentally, nobody never met a new friend staying indoors, so without making it too complicated, I’ve just been trying to be out more, you never know who you might run into"
1,"Hey!:) I'm Feli, 21 and from Germany.
After a rough, but adventures summer, Im looking forward to meeting new people. Anyone interested in getting to know eachother?"
1,"I truly enjoyed this video, it made me realize many things, thanks"
2,Me doing all those things to gain friends like spending time and energy and making an effort sounds great BUT no-one has ever done such things for me to gain my friendship so I'm okay with being alone
1,"When people get married and have kids, they will have no time for friendship. Or they have some emotional issues and don’t want to be with you if you share your problems with them."

1,"Biggest mistake of my life was moving to Germany in the middle of the pandemic. Before it all, my main hobbies were swing dancing (too risky to do that now), snowboarding (I live too far away from the mountains now), and video games (not an outside social activity). Couple that with Germans being woefully unsocial with outsiders, I'm fucked."
1,Please keep in mind that disabled/immunocompromised people are still greatly affected by the ongoing pandemic and it's often unsafe or inaccessible for us to go anywhere.
1,This gives hope I feel all gitty now
2,Thanks so much for making this
1,"I may be stuck with people inside the same building and share activities and schedule but that doesn't necessarily translate into them becoming my friends. Acquaintances at best. I will try to keep in touch to them outside our shared time and then see if the others reply in the same way, reaching out to me when I'm by myself and... the result? always the same: no one reaches out to me. Been left out of reunions just because I wasn't there at the moment people set it up but then, I witnessed them reacing out to people that weren't there to get invited to said reunion so yeah... I don't try anymore. It saddens me for sure, but then I remember why am I lonely and why I gave up on trying and go ""yeah...fuck it""."
1,That title called me out
2,Really helpful video . Thanks a lot

Thank you for the videosmiling_face_with_smiling_eyes"
1,Heeeey everybody!
1,"this is so beautiful and true in many ways.
after moving somewhere else at the age of 10/11, i had lost all contact with my childhood friends. i had made no friends during my 7-year move and had always stayed inside 24/7/365 during my teenage years, although i only met one person or two, but for a short time. im an adult now, and back where i originally was before moving, im working now and i am socializing with the people i work with and have made bonds with a few of them. im not sure how i overcame this 7 year long introvertness, but im here now, making plans to hang with friends. i was in tears explaining this to my cousin last month saying ""i can't remember the last time i was genuinely happy"" to just have fun, and be myself around other people who are not family. friendships are a must-have in life, because it brings a lot of color to the blank, white canvas."
1,It's all about social intelligence. You've got and it and you rule the world. You've lack of it and you die alone.
1,"I usually have a positive outcome from your videos, but not this one. Everyone I try to engage with usually has negative results and I'm the type to reach out to people... all the time. it's never the other way around and it's disheartening. It feels like something's wrong with me. Eventually it gets so bad that the people I befriended just take advantage of me and/or backstab me. I lost all trust with people because of it. Now I have a dog... that's all I need."
2,"Wow! this explained so much on the psychology of friendship for me! I learnt so much and now understand more about my previous friendships, Thanks. :D"
2,I'm happy with the few friends I have. Not lonely. Rather have a small amount of best friends over a lot of just simply friends. smiling_facethumbs_up_light_skin_tone
2,I know I sounds like a broken record... but these videos are SO GOOD.
1,"i honestly find it easier to talk to people online, rather than irl"
1,"I beg your pardon.

I am interested in making friends, online, and in real life.

If you would like to make a new friend, or if you would simply like to talk to someone, about anything, then please reply to this comment.

I would be more than happy to speak with you, concerning any topic, for any length of time.

My own interests include anime, history, music, religion, and art.

I apologize if this is too forward.

I am new at this.

Making friends, I mean.

However, I am more than willing to learn.

Thank You.

May eternal blessings be upon you.

Amen.

2,"i love this channel, easily the best content on YouTube."
1,"It's so hard to find even 1 friend as a 30 yr old asocial autist, living in this current society. Have no 'regular' friends and never had a partner. Games (even here everything solo), series, the internet and weed is all I've got lol."
1,Maybe I should stop ignoring my coworkers
1,"This is also good advice:
Next time you feel bored, don't open your phone. You will be way more approachable and who knows what will happen."
1,"I have always been told college was supposed to be a wonderful time, making new friends, partying, etc etc. But I realized that while I may talk to many people on campus and during class, once I am back in my apartment, I am alone. It is much harder to make long-lasting friendship in college than in high school in my opinion, and this goes without saying of course that in college, the number of people are simply larger and you will not be taking the same classes as in high school. Every semester, and every class will have different students, even if you have similar majors. But nonetheless, the profound sense of loneliness really hits in moments where you don't talk to friends from high school for a while, knowing that you haven't made much friends in college, and you are by yourself back home. COVID didn't help with making friends, obviously, and that was during my freshmen year, the year that is the ideal time to make new friends and acquaintances. Even after joining clubs and whatnot, I still cannot confidently say I am true ""friends"" with those people as I am with friends in high school."

1,"I’ve never had more than 4-5 friends at a time. In grades 7-12, I had only one. I’m an introvert and very shy, in my early 40’s, and lost touch with others during the pandemic. Social media has led me to want friends less and my highly intelligent nephew (of similar age) recently died of cancer, so I have an enormous hole of no one to talk to about most subjects I enjoy. I know I’m in a bad, depressed state, but I see no way to help. I hope others stay out of this rut."
1,This channel knows exactly what almost everyone needs.....
2,Friends? You mean future backstabbers.
1,"Welp, you are saying im fucked because all my friends are oversea across the world? No way.

Sorry, but my highschool friends in Canada still contact as a group meetig once every two weeks to make sure we keep this contact intact.

Proximity matters alot, sure. But if it's a real friendship, it doesn't matter,  just keep contact any way you can."
1,"friendships for me has always been a constant of me overestimating how much time people want to spend with me, doesnt have to be about hanging out, responding to my chats alone feels like such a burden. maybe i am at fault"

1,Recently I moved up in my education system to a gymnasium I want to make friends but people have already made “groups” that they like to be in I’m kinda in one two but I don’t like on of my friends he keeps making people around him do things with him and not in a friendly way in a possessive and rude way then he’ll insult you and at the end of the day he will tell you your his best friend and that he doesn’t have a lot. It gives me difficulties talking to others cause he doesn’t want me to and i want to get away from him but we are in a shared friend group outside of school and I don’t want to loose those connections.

1,"It's like Kurzgesagt reads my mind with these videos, why is this coming up right when my struggle reaches its peak"
1," Biggest cap I've ever heard in my life. Being present but silent means that people try to fill in what they don't know themselves, without talking with you to even bother verifying what they've come up with as facts to them. And since people are usually cynical, it's usually the bad crap."
1,"This is what I was searching for, Thank you very much for making this video today!"
1,"One problem some of us have is not really about finding interest or motivation to get to know people. Instead, some of us have problems communicating. Some people have great communication skills but others don't. It's a simple as describing it as: we don't know what to say. Most confuse this with shyness or fear of being judged. But for some,  it's not that. Literally the mind is blank even if we have similar interests, goals or are in the same course or working environment. Sometimes it's not enough to actually know quite a lot about the topic that is being talked about. It's the actual communication and social skills. I've struggled with that my whole life even if I'm always trying to meet new people, have initiative and attend events. Still trying to find solutions to know what to say to keep the interaction meaningful, but it really is a topic that is either not discussed or misunderstood as shyness and insecurity."
1,"I feel like I need friends I feel lonely, will consider meeting new people"
1,"I haven’t had a close, intimate friendship with anyone since 3rd grade. I’m 17 now, I’ve moved to a bunch of different areas and I’ve struggled immensely with making friends. I feel like I’ve been so unlucky lol because I’ve had experiences where I try to talk to people and they flat out tell me that they don’t want to talk to me face_with_tears_of_joy I think it’s sorta affected my ability to have courage and take initiative, which really sucks. Not only that, but I also have very low self esteem and I feel as though many of my interests are very unusual. Lots of my family have judged me for it and I feel like any new acquaintances would do the same, so I burn out a bunch of energy just trying to put on a basic persona of someone who just…doesn’t care about anything. It makes it to where I can’t connect with people because it doesn’t allow me to get past surface-level small talk with others."

1,"i live far place from where I used to live and maked good friends but now we are just online and haven't met them from last 3-4 years and in new place where I live in school I just feel excluded no one really is my friend, tried to make some but always failed and get ignored my whole class makes plan and enjoy I'm the only one  who is always left aside from all plane"

2,well this was timed perfectly
1,"what if  I intentionally  dont want friends? in my college i don't think i'm fitting , i dont find myself having a connection with any of my colleagues its just me and my mind talking to each other half the time"
1,"I'm so good at making friends that everyone I've ever met either wants to be my slave or to be my bodyguard, btw I've stopped making friends and the reason for that is I've moved so much that I've just lost the will to make friends, looking at people reminds me of the friends I've lost."
1,Yo imagine watching this shit fr
2,"Ah, perfect timing"
0,And what if im happy while being lonely?
1,"Coincidences are sometimes scary, Yesterday was just the first face to face class of my college and just thought about me failed at making friends on the first day with my classmates."
1,"I'm a weird kind of friend, I never say no to a meetup, but I don't really seek for them constantly, I really value time alone and my own hobbies."
1,"You see, my main issue is I am a big introvert. At work I would quite like to be friends with my coworkers, but I have a personal stigma of not approaching people first. If they want to be friends with me, they need to approach me first. It's my way of gauging if they are even interested in me as a friend in the first place. But because of that, despite me having been there for I think 2.5 months, they barely say anything to me. Only when I'm being told what needs to be done for the day or being asked for help. It's times like this that make me believe that I just simply don't fit into the grand puzzle that is life."
1,When will it be subtitled in Italian? I need to share this with a person that speak only Italian grinning_face_with_sweat
1,"I am lonely and I have no friends because I like it this way. Life is much more simple, more chill.
Having one person similar to you who you chat together, be together and more... is more than enough.. for me.."
1,"That point about proximity really ties in with some thoughts I’ve had about suburban sprawl and how it contributes to the atomization of society. In the dorm example, lots of people live in close proximity to each other, meaning the number of possible connections is huge. But out in suburbia, where far fewer people live within walking distance, the proximity factor can’t contribute as helpfully. So people are way more likely to end up isolated, alone in their little wooden castles on their tiny fiefdoms. I feel like this helps to explain a lot of the social ills in America."
2,I actually don't really want to have much of them like I like them all but sometimes is fine to don't have them
1,"yes, don't expect anythintg^^"
1,"I'm fuckin boring, people just lose interest in me. No matter how hard I try, how much effort I make... At the end of the day you can't make people choose you. I'm just done with life."
1,"I’ve been lonely the past few years. I did have my first gf but we broke up a few months ago and now I’m lonely again. This video was nice thank you. Tho I consider myself an introvert so while loneliness is upsetting, I do like being alone and I do have social anxiety."
1,I come here to report that in Chile we already had our first meeting as a group (more than 20 gathered from 100) and it was a total success. So happy for the opportunity red_heart
1,Ain't a problem for me made friends during the quarantine by gaming and online class lol
1,I have spent a total of zero hours on tick tok
1,Ah I don’t talk to anyone but one person and I am good with that
1,I had an close friend who I would whisper a lot of stuff and he would say it to other people. That’s how I lost an close friend who was my bully after that. Let’s say people found him funny and stuff I would tell to him. There are moments I will never forget
1,i literally walked up to a group of people during a band event and said “I am inserting myself into this friend group” and that’s how i got my first friend group in this new city

1,"As a person with social anxiety, I feel happier when I’m alone. Although I do agree it helps a lot when you’re surrounded by people who get you"
1,weird question: did a new animator started working on this episode?
1,"So I present the case of me and my Sister-in-Law. Someone who, for years, I was mean and spiteful too along with the rest of my wife's family. Reasons? Can only believe its the generally bitter and hateful attitude of living with my father for 20 years that rubbed off on me and made me intolerable of most other people. This year I had a huge revelation after the death of a grandparent and I snapped out of it and don't see the point of being spiteful and mean to anyone in life anymore.

Fast forward, I realise how much of a wonderful, kind and hard working person my sister in law is. I think I'd secretly been admiring her strength and confidence to radically change her own life for years. For the last 9 or so months we've been to a couple of concerts together and are generally on much better footing with each other. However, I've wanted to become better friends and be closer to her (in a strictly plutonic way; lets not muddy things here) and generally they say you should ""show interest/ be interested"" which I very much do. However, it appears that she doesn't want me to be interested in her, but still happy for me to keep going to shows and concerts with her. Is this what they call a transactional friendship? Is she still reserved because she thinks my friendship and no longer being mean are superficial?

Her behaviour combined with my new found sense of making better friends and just treating the world with more kindness has sent me on a spiral of reading. How can I tell if she wants to be genuine friends (and not just related)? The last thing I want is a friendship that is transactional or (even worse) she feels is forced on her because of politeness/ I'm her sister's husband. She hates ""drama"" which I feel like asking her how she feels about our friendship will, in her mind, generate ""drama"". Would rather just be told she doesn't want to be friends as at the moment, I just feel like shit from going through a cycle of acceptance and rejection on a daily/weekly basis.

Edit: Feel like I should also be clear in saying that she might just enjoy doing these certain things with me but is simply just establishing clear boundaries. We are, at the end of the day, both straight and of the opposite sex."
1,My buddy proposed an app in our group chat the other day to help people meet up. We discussed it for a few hours. Then I saw this video posted 4 hours prior and sent it to him. You can't plan this stuff.
2,Being alone is the best though. Solves so many problems.
1,"the absolute worst combo you can possibly have in life is being extremely extraverted but lacking the social skills to back up that need. you constantly have a need for social interation but you already know it will inevetably end in failure it isn't a matter of if but when. nothing is more depressing than knowing that you should not try again but you think to yourself this time will be different, but it always ends the same. online or physical  work or school being doomed socially because you were born with a handicap despite having a deep need honestly the most depressing thing in life."
1,I have no friends that this is the only video I got notification forrolling_on_the_floor_laughing
2,This is where I would share the video with my friends if I had one!
1,We want this video in Hindi heart_exclamation
1,Anyone else wondering why this was recommended?
1,"Everybody get ready for the ""omg let's all take a moment to appreciate the videos!!!""
Yes the videos are good but this is just them farming likes



Also let's take a moment to appreciate how much time and money they pour into every video















Never gonna give you up"
1,"Common interests are a great way to meet people. If you're interested in eating humans though, it tends to get a bit annoying when finding too many people. Only room for so much meat in my tummy you know."
1,Is it really that odd to just keep friends over the internet on social media platforms? Since the pandemic i really don't mind just talking to people over discord or WhatsApp since you can leave the conversation anytime you want.
1,Covid 19 showed me who was my friend and who wasn't...

2,"I moved in the beginning of the pandemic. In a new country, with everything on lockdown... I made no friends and feels like I lost all my friends from before.. I feel like I forgot how to make friends."
0,I have 10 friends and 1 friend who I am in weak contact with. AND I HATE IT!!!(I live in shelton Washington)
1,"this one is interesting , a world wide experiment nerd_face

i am in , but i guess i will just be too shy to really go out and meet random people rolling_on_the_floor_laughing"
1,Im a extrovert who hates spicy stuff
2,"Great recommendation YouTube 
Rub salt into the wound"
1,Hello there also will definitely come to the meet-up
1,this video is just what i needed today !!! i just started a new work thing after being sick for over a year and suffering from social phobia and depression. im constantly putting pressure on myself that i have to do well and make friends immediately but your video really helped me realize that im doing just fine and making friends in my own pace. thank you endlessly <3
1," 
smooth"
0,oh my god what a depressing video.
1,"Stonebro lol

Also how did the captains fail to spell kurzgesagt differently each time it was mentioned in the video."
2,"Needed this. Thank you! It’s been hard, but this is what I needed."
1,"I think charisma plays a factor in this too, if you are a charismatic person people are a lot more likely to engage with you. It’s kinda funny cause I look at myself as both introvert/extrovert cause I have qualities of both. I have no problem with taking the stage and being a total ham but at the same time if I have been around people for too long it begins to become draining on me and then I need to be by myself for a few days to unpack the sensory overload if that makes any sense. But recently I have been learning to appreciate solitude, not loneliness."
1,Any online friend groups in here? I hardly see my best friends face to face but I speak to them on the daily using discord and other voice programs
1,"Last year I went through my contacts list and reached out to everyone I hadn't talk to in a while. A considerable number shared with me that they were feeling extremely lonely and isolated. Some were really struggling to make it through their days. I think we are seeing these feelings proliferating in profoundly novel ways. Social media may be to blame, but I think it is more existential than that. People are experiencing less positive thought and happiness, and hope is less accessible. We need ways to reconnect to ourselves and those around us."
1,it's not that i don't want to make friends however i used to believe friends arw everything till they stabbed u from behind face_vomiting
1,This is why the human population will decrease. There will be no next generation.
1,Wow this almost feels like a personal attack but I'll stick around skull
1,classic kurzgesagt making me worry about me later in life
1,"If only romance could ""take up"" some of my time..."
1,I am early
1,"Let's not forget the biggest reason making friends is hard: we don't have time because we live in a dystopian capitalistic hellhole where bosses/ceos makes us overwork without paying nearly enough. The average man today works far more hours than a mideaval peasant, even though we have machines that could and does do the job of thousands of peasants. Why exactly do we work? Because of the asshole in the elite. Fuck all of them"
1,"No way, the memes of Kurzgesagt mocking you acually became reality."
1,Just gotta say that I love your animations so much that I found myself so emotionally invested in the little characters' stories throughout this video haha.
1,This is undoubtedly the best kurzgesagt video that has ever come out.
1,The fact that I’m watching this and I have friends…
1,Hey where you spying me?
1,"I'm 38 in a few weeks, and over the past few years I fully came to understand what an awful person I am, so I helped save the ""friends"" I did have and left all social media and these ""friends"" behind. They don't need to deal with me and my shit. I'll see my days out on my own, it's the best for everyone."
1,"I think it bears repeating that accepting and creating invitations to others is a great way to stoke friendships. Also don’t feel frustrated if you feel like you always need to initiate and no one else does. It’s probably not actually true, and even if it is, just be happy others want to participate with you."
1,"Kinda ironic why YT recommended me this video but just today, I added a few friends on FB which are some of my classmates I kind of hanged out with and I realized we can get along with few things."
1,im gonna watch this every day until i make at least 5 new friends
1,"Kurzgesagt is spying on me, I don't have friends and I'm a very homebody person"
1,"Kurzgesagt: ""So bring people together by starting a board game group...""

Also Kurzgesagt:  _Uses _*_CATAN_*_ as an example._"
1,“Being lonely is not from being alone but by having your mind untouched from society’s way’s.”
1,"If I'm gonna be completely honest I don't particularly like having friends, sure they're nice to have but having friends is not really my style of having fun since I just prefer to do everything alone"
1,"My bro was the “central” person, and since he went to live away, i feel pretty disconnected to anyone around me"
0,I feel personally attacked by that title.
2,All of the ideas shared in the video are genuinely brilliant thank you so much!
1,"I used to have a lot of friends at one point of my life. But since the last couple years I decided not to have relationship anymore with anybody because I know the conversation would lead to ""what do you do now? what do you do for living?"" Since I don't know the answer (because something happened to me and fucked up my life, my mid 20s life) and I'm to scared to get confronted with that question, I decided to step away from society and all of my close friends."
1,Yea but what if you get physically ill when you're invited places
1,"The biggest thing you mentioned that's personally applicable is some people being a sort of ""hub"" for social connections. When my ex-girlfriend broke up with me, it became apparent just how many people I was good friends with via her. I lost quite a few friends when she left."
2,The power of friendship
1,I've been called out.
1,"Anyone ever feel that even when you do all the steps you can, no one hangs around for long? It makes me feel like I’m the problem and I can’t figure out why"
1,"I just started highschool, my entire friend group split up and I've never felt more lonely lol. My social anxiety makes it pretty much inpossible for me to Meet new people. Praying this video will help me folded_hands"
1,I can make friends if i speak up but most ppl....dont fit with me
1,The fact that this is #4 on trending says a lot about today's society.
1,but what should I do when people don't want to spend time with me? I'm trying to be nice and kind but nothing is changing...
1,"The trouble with friends is they end up becoming nothing more than baggage. I've had friends in the past but so much of that time was spent pretending we had more in common than we actually did, probably as a way to get through school. Too many arseholes to ignore. Now I just can't be bothered. Yeah, I'm lonely but at least I can identify with it. person_shrugging"
1,*after this video you were filled with DETERMINATION
1,This isnt educational or informative at all
2,"""Friends make life good""
My friends : are you sure about that?"
1, nah mate that’s gonna sting for years. I’ll still be lying in my bed wondering wtf is wrong with me in five years time thinking about that one moment.
2,"I keep having those moments lately where I suddenly want to just delete my entire online existence and disappear.

Feeling lonely all the damn time and left out of a lot of fun things I’d like to do with my friends.

Shits hard sometimes guys, I hope you’re all okay"
1,"Finally, a scientifically oriented channel using the term ""vibe"" . Sometimes you just gotta feel it. and when it doubt, best not to shout it out."
1,People: woman_runningperson_runningwhen they hear that I watch only anime.
2,DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THIS COMMENT!!!
1,"It took me a good two years to find a solid circle of friends when I moved to my current city. I took some advice that I saw online- ""just say yes."" If you're brand new somewhere, accept every invitation you get. Not every connection will pan out, but you may by proxy find someone else you click with. It's like throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks. When I first moved I was invited to a house party by a random stranger I had known for a few days. I am extroverted but have social anxiety around new people- but if I hadn't have been dedicated to the ""just say yes"" mentality I would have stayed in my comfort zone and would have never made some of my closest friends"
1,"Sorry but making friends is not simple, I could never do it... and I never knew why"
1,graphics of this video seem very obviously like they're made the way they are to fit on tiktok ;; i miss the pretty graphics!
1,"This video is designed to deceive you into thinking that you were inadequate and lonely and that you need approval and to be part of a popularity structure and that you need to be part of a mob. Don’t buy into it. Learn to be strong and comfortable and content just being yourself, by yourself. Once you have that, then consider allowing one or two people into that."
1,"I need friends pleading_face..
Just always lonely, it's killing alot... 
It's so painful I won't be able to attend kurzgesagt meetup because I reside in Africa. Who wants to be my friend?"
1,Anyone else feel a little weird that they arent birds?
1,"Is it really worth it though? the amount of pain and drama from friendships.. honestly though the few friends you have keep them close and just be yourself, if people can't accept you for being ""you"" they're not your friends. And just be positive, And even though no one may care I'm writing this to remind myself and others that you're not alone and they're always someone there for you and to never give up. *Edit* ( I hope everyone reading this, has an amazing week and have the motivation to keep moving forward."
1,"As someone who moved 1000s of miles during high school, this is something that I really needed to hear as I suddenly find myself not knowing anyone."
1,Is it normal that I want to be alone atm?
1,"One of my issues is that there are rarely spaces in which people are expected to be there explicitly to make friends and social connections. There's always an agenda, a focus, or a financial cost driving things. Think about movies, bars, gyms, and meetup groups.

When I was a teenager I would sometimes wander the streets at night and lament that there was nowhere I could go just to meet people. I would always feel like I'm intruding others if I try and start a conversation with them without having been invited to first.

What I want, and I'd love to set this up if I ever have the resources, is a space where the explicit stated purpose is to meet and interact with others. Learn from each other, talk about life, engage in shared hobbies, and discuss mutual interests. I'd have a big lobby with tables and different areas set up for exactly that, and make sure it was clear to everyone there that new arrivals are encouraged to join existing groups and have conversations with strangers, and everyone is expected to be welcoming to new arrivals.

There would also be rooms available to use for private groups and scheduled activities, and staff on hand to address any instances of uncomfortable behaviour.

I think every community could use a space like that."

1,4 min ago but comment is 5hours
1,"And nere I'm, movie away from every(thing/one).... & Can't even pretend that I care...."
1,I thought this was going to go into what happens to your brain when you're lonely. This one sucks.
1,"anyone else was ""adopted"" by an extrovert and now is friends with their social circle after they made you go to things with them?"
1,"I find it frustrating how the video has stated that proximity counts more than similar interests. That was absolutely not true for me. My online friends kept me far more stable than in-person friends from school have in the recent years. 
I have social anxiety so I struggle to open up in-person, I do far better opening up to others online. For an educational channel situated online, I would've expected kurzegesagt to atleast acknowledge the importance of online friends that hold just the same amount, or more, importance than conveniently close by individuals. It feels crude and honestly frustrating to be told the people who saved my life and my stability are not as important as the person who hung out with me occasionally but never spent time doing things I liked because they didn't like it.

To all those with online friends; 
People who don't understand cannot tell you how much they mean to you. They are trying to tell you what's good for you when they have no idea how you were before you met those online friends."
1,"What this video is missing is how to get a conversation going. People who say they ""hate small talk"" and just want deep meaningful conversation just want the payoff without any of the work. The point of small talk is to go past it in the first place! You need to ask questions and start light to find common ground. Ever try to cold-open about your deepest ambitions and dreams or ramble on about a hobby no one is into? Yeah, super weird. Don't be that guy/gal."
2,We are all here to make friends lmao
1,"If we are watching this video, we all have something in common"
1,"you know I am a very lonely person but today that changed. I had one friend before, a really really good friend. but I can only talk to him after school and today he is gone for 3 days, I thought this was gonna be a nightmare because I couldn't talk to anyone after school. but yesterday I talked to my therapist about how easy it is to just isolate yourself from others, but she got a random college i didn't know to come in and we just practiced talking.

you know it ok to just talk to people, and silence isn't awkward and is 90% of a conversation. but I have paranoia about these things after trauma so I automaticly think people will want to hurt me in some way. but I as I thought to myself on what to ask I realized that there isn't some sort of timer that ticks down when there's silence. infact it's really nice to have silence because the other person doesn't find it awkward as long as you don't show you're uncomfortable. and you can ask some anything and do it however you want, unless you're really trying to be rude which is pretty impossible to do.

so I just asked someone today at PE if we can stick together, whenever I thought of something that came up in my head that i wanted to say or ask I would just say it and that worked. after PE I saw the guy again sitting with a girl so I just said hello to them and sat at the same table, this would have been a crazy thing for me normally but I was feeling confident and I felt more comfortable around the guy. guess what? they just said hello back and returned the smile, they didn't even question anything for a second. I didn't talk much at first, but I tried to show that I was friendly and intrested in them. so they returned the favor when I got the courage to tell them something, they were intrested in what i had to say and they talked to eachother but always showed me pictures or something so I wasn't left out and I could just ask about stuff which was also something they liked.

so now I learned that: my anxiety is not realistic, people like what I have to say, people think I'm funny, being sweaty doesn't make people think you're gross (it's really hot today) and nobody think your creepy unless you clearly cross a boundary (I'm nervous about this but clearly I would be too uncomfortable with something before that can happen).


all and just don't really think about what people will think or if something is wrong to do because it's not wierd to interact with strangers. and nervousness doesn't mean they are uncomfortable and silence isn't awkward, it's normal and actually can improve your interaction. if someone is imidiately being repulsive to you or is trying to make you uncomfortable then their dickheads and their judgement isn't relevent because they just want to hurt you. most people are good people, you might think something they do is meant to be mean but usually its because they don't understand.

hope this helps someone"
1,Loved the detail of the safety knot in the rock climbing area.
0,Really hurts to have this recommended to me when I'm just waiting for my cat to grow old and pass away so I can kill myself.
1,YEAH BUDDY THE VIDEO IS FULL OF EDUCATION MANY THINGS TO LEARN KEEP IT UP BUDDY
1,"After my mom died, the last close person to me in this world is gone. I don't really have any close family or friends, so i'm lonely often at this point in my life"
1,"While watching this I first thought to myself ""but it's more complicated than that, there isn't enough time to invest in friends"", but you know what? You're right. Now that I think about it I do have friends which I really miss a lot. I haven't heard from them in about a year, some of them maybe even more, but we had a great friendship before and I really don't want that to go to waste. 

Thank you Kurzgesagt for reminding me"
1, WHAT IN THE-
1,"It's not easy as it sounds loudly_crying_face idkw but my brain tends to automatically decide within seconds if I'm interested of a person or not. Like the person could seem perfectly fine, good even and even match hobbies/sense of humour but I really don't want to continue the convo or get closer to be pals and I my self have no say in this skull I tried many times, fake it, till you make it but the feelings just get worse, to were I feel extremely uncomfortable/ stomach turning and just get stressed or really tried within the person's presence, and sadly this happens about 90% of the time, which makes clicking with people pretty rare, to the point that I lowkey become obsessive  of the friendship to then high stress of losing that friendship, then that normally brakes the friendship because I can't handle it skull I know BPD and autism probably plays a big role in this but it sucks big time and idk how to fix it"
1,"That's why my motto is ""I hope we have a great experience together until we become strangers again"" I already know that we are going to separate and become strangers again whether it be college or moving out but I have accepted that well not really but until that days comes I hope we have a great time together."
1,This vid is inspiring me to take friendly risks! Ty smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,I’ve had a bunch of “friends” but only a few real ones. I’d rather be alone then deal with fake perpetrators
1,"""This is why it's so easy to form friendships in school""...umm, yeah..."
1,"Even as someone with a healthy group of friends who has never really felt loneliness for long periods of time, this video was really helpful for reminding me that not everyone is in the same situation and that there will likely be a time I'll need to make new friends."
1,"One of these examples was me as an undergrad. I had a friend who had like 8 friends and I was on good terms with all of them. Some of them closer than others. However, I always felt out of place when my main friend wasn't there, like did I even belong here. Am I just intruding? And when my friend stopped talking to me, that hurt a lot, I lost all those connections at once. Now, as a grad student, I'm trying to reach out more so I'm not as lonely. So far, it's been good."
1,YO! The animation in this one is so well-done and lively! The characters are very charismatic and the attention to detail in every scene is so phenomenal!!
1,Me watching video how to get friends… T-T
1,"Thank you so much for this video. I moved to Canada as an international student during the pandemic. Lack of connections and the inability to make new friends made me suffer for these past few years. As restrictions started to ease, I tried to start finding solutions and I managed to make new friends. This video just confirmed to me that I'm following the right path and it's just a matter of time before I can form the social connections that I had in my country. Thank you again kurzgesagt every video you make is just a blessing. Much love <3 <3"
1,Didn't expect to be called out like this by Kurzgesagt
1,“put your bestie to the testie” smirking_face
1,These targeted ads are getting really really deep and personal..
1,This video hits home with me.  I have (had?) 2 close friends IRL.  One rarely gets back to me when I initiate communication and the other got married and moved 900 miles away.  As someone dealing with fear of abandonment issues due to my parent's divorce it makes me skittish to reach out for new relationships.  It has been...really tough lately dealing with it.
1,"What I’ve learnt is people you think are your friends often aren’t. You are better off having a dog. They are loving and completely. Everybody sooner or later will let you down, some more than others, and after awhile enough is enough. Friends are over rated and I’m sure a lot of people reading this will be better off without them. It’s nice to have a real friend. But very rarely are they really there for you when you need them."
1,Did you actually just suggest that chronically lonely people just watch your video about why their lives suck and they're going to die horribly?!?!
1,"A video for all introverts, mostly."
1,"FML I'm so lonely 
10 years ago I used to be so extroverted and popular.
How life changes drastically."
1,"Comediy? Is the DIY a play on 'do it yourself' for an open mic. That's clever, if it was intentional."
1,"Now I'm 23 and near to be 24 yrs old. I think 
I lost my friends in my childhood and friends in high school and I didn't finish my college.  
But I am continung my study now. Even though I'm strugling with the challenges I'm facing everyday I'm still choosing not to give up. I'm a loner now. Like going to school that I am not comfortable 'cuz I'm an introvert. I choose this way before but now I don't wanna be like this anymore. I want to enjoy my college and improve my life. I'm praying for God to give me a companion that is best for me. Please pray for me to have a to have a bestfriend that help me and inspire me always."
1,Mr.kurzgesagt really here attacking people with his titlesskull
2,"K, I thought we were friends, why you calling us out like that"
1,"One problem Ive realized recently is that 90% of the people I would call as friends, never really check on me, ask me out, invite me or even share new things with me. A lot of those people will of course, come ask me if everything is ok if they notice me not so happy, but I've found that this is not friendship. It sort of sent me into a loner depression where I'm coming to terms with who is and isn't a friend, who is and isn't someone that cares with you. 
I feel there is a very distorted we have of friendships, where we simply assume someone who shares space/time with us is as invested in them as they are in us. It stings extra when something happens, bad or that keeps you away, and these people don't even notice you're gone.

Take care of yourself, and pay attention to those who pay attention to you."
0,This is funny. I’m lonely.
2,I'm too much of a reddittor to be good at making friends
1,I never really get invitations from anybody; I don't really have friends and I have had no one to spend my last 6 birthday with. Please haalp rip
1,"And herein lies the paradox: to make friends you need to reach out and make effort towards other people, but you also need the same to be done to you. But most of the time, if you arent the one doing it, no one will do it to you

So how can you make friends, when no one wants you as one"
0,It’s not even «are you lonely» it’s just «your lonely»
2,"The globalists need more leverage on you.  Make more friends, now!!!1!"
1,"This is the best video in this channel history
Scientific, amusing, full of hope and very very important topic"
2,"ok, why was this recommended to me?"

1,"Incredible video, it explains everything so well and gives me hope.
I wonder if there's any advice for online friendships that don't have the luxury of proximity as most of my interests are online and gaming based so naturally most (if not all) of my friends at the moment are online."
1,The video didn't talk about friendships in groups vs. 1-on-1. I feel like most of my close 1-on-1 friendships were formed in groups; it's even harder to make 1-on-1 frienships as you get older. Why is that?
1,waving_hand
1," Drawing with permanent markers on a sleeping persons face is *NOT* a silly joke unless you are *ABSOLUTELY* sure the person drawn upon also will *ALSO* find it fun when they wake up.
If they don't, then it is abuse - and in som legislations counted as physical violence.
(I am not claiming the markers in the animation is permanent markers)."
1,It's a little sad that a video like that is needed in today's world
2,Ok so who wanna be friends?
0,i will never have friends slightly_frowning_faceconfused_face
2,Just got into huge crisis with two of my very best friends. It's supportive to hear this.
1,ngl I desperately need this video but I never looked for it
1,"This might actually be the best kurzgesagt video, the animation is incredible, so is the script, the topic is something we can all understand/relate on a personal level, it's helpful for so many people, just amazing work, as always"
1,I thought youtube algorithm know that i have few friends uwu
1,"It’s too late for that, at least for me anyway."
2,Anybody here wants to be friends? :D
1,"Imagine how much time you spend scrolling social media yearly. Now Imagine of you had all that free time to do literally anything else, from self improvement activity to socializing."
1,"This made me realize all the mistakes I do without realizing. The rejection of invitations that I definitely wanted to go to but somehow messed up and declined. The way I may not sound and look friendly at all when saying hi to people. I have 1 true bff and she's too far away from me and I haven't seen here in years. I have friends from school that are genuinely good people and trusty but even though we live close to each other، I've never hung out them while they do that pretty much every day and night together. Yet they never invite me apart from 1 or 2 times when I first met them. I must've given the impression that I'm totally happy not going out and he has told me ""so you don't go out anyway"" confused_face
I genuinely want to. But I'm too caught up in this trap for years that everyone around me knows my habbit and it'll be unusual if they see me going out like everyone and will tell ""is that you?"". Of course this should not be a reason not to go. I've switched this habbit and gone out and hung out with people many times in past years and only the first time was a bit awkward, otherwise it felt very natural after getting used to it. However once I stop doing this, I go back to the weird feelings and old habit of not going out and it just gets more stable and becomes the default again. But I feel like it would be be easier for me if I moved to somewhere else with a fresh start."
1,Still nothing about the war in Ukraine - somehow anything that shows Germany in a bad light is overlooked :)
1,haha i really needed this thanks kurzegesagt. i have no friends at school or even outside of school and i haven't since 6th grade. i've pretty much forgot how to socialize with people hehe
0,Reading this title hurts.
1,"How to make friends and influence people- dale carnigal 
Good book that every one here can read"
2,I can make friends for 2-3 weeks but after they see my true self they leave me
1,"OMFG, this video is just on another level compared to other youtube videos!"
1,"A friendship has to be a two way thing. Its exhausting, you cannot put yourself out there time and time again to the same person or group of people if they are not reciprocating the same effort back. If you have a friend which you are always initiating the conversation with or making the arrangements with to do stuff. You are their friend, but they're not your friend. One sided friendships are not worth the hassle."
1,"This seems very accurate to me but I can never manage the laid-back part lol. It's hard to care the ""right amount"" so I've kind of given up trying to regulate that recently."
1,"He helped me realize that I was in danger of HELL and Judgement.  
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                /,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,/. ,/. ,/.,/.,"
1,"I hate having friends, they always seem to be wanting something, and exchange very little in return."
2,But what if you feel like it's better if you are a burden for the  people who you love like friends. I'm destroying my social life and online life because i speculate people hate me and if I'm gone it's better
2,This video is kind of useless for me cuz I made my entire classroom my friend
1,"Coming out as transgender lost us access to multiple family members close by and the friendships we've made since have been flattened by the pandemic. My wife has multiple health issues which limits our ability to socialize. The company I work for (remotely) is based three states away and my wife has been on disability for seven years. We are both very lonely and very tired.
Edit: thank you for making this video. I've texted one of my friends we haven't seen since the pandemic began and haven't talked to in 9 months."
0,It's sad that this is #4 on trending
2,Thanks for being the most informative and best channel to look to for help on certain things.
2,Thank you smiling_face_with_hearts
1,"I graduated from an art school a few months ago and I can already feel some friendships fading. This video is a great reminder for me to send out some invitations! 
Thanks Kurzgesagt :)"
2,Thank you so much!!!It will help me a lot.I believe.
2,Distorted Self Image (seeking perfection)
2,neutral_face this algorithm is making fun of me
0,i should send this to a discord mod
2,Me who has only a few friends and with people that really want to be my friend!
1,"Actually I talk with everybody like with everybody in school and would talk with other people in other classes yet I couldn't find a better best friend and would feel lonely most of the time I usually talk funny and make others laugh,help them in academics and people would ask help from me rather their own friends like for notes and other stuffs I don't hurt anybody but I can't find any friendspensive_facepensive_face"
1,"I used to be very chatty. I had many friends but after years of bullying my confidence went down, now that I graduated I didn't even realize but my personality has shifted from a open and fun person to a very closed off introverted person cautious of everyone.

My sister told me that people are more willing and open then I think, I recently started to talk to this one guy at my work place, small things like sharing memes and small talk here and there. 

It's really just that, talking to people, being open, and slowly advancing. Another thing is if people don't want to open to you it's better to not try with that person and find someone else. You can't open up someone, only they can do that."
1,"me and my friends are an interconnected group, basically everyone has strong relationships with everyone, we are a total of 9 people and Because of this, trying to get away from someone in the group is not only difficult, it hurts and a lot.I can see the group missing someone, but this image I create is like a birthday party without the birthday person, something is missing"
1,I haven't had offline friends in a decade. It's all online now. It's not the same but it's not as abnormal as you might think.
1,"Another thing not often talked about.  Some of the people you hang out with are not your friends. Look if the people you hang out with make you feel anxious, or sad, or bully you they arent really your friends. Friends , when you have them will make you feel joy not fear or anxiety. You deserve to have people in your life that make you feel better not worse after having interacted.

Be careful and take care of yourself."
1,Man Kurzgesagt started from being my teacher into being my online therapist.

1,"Ok let me be really honest here. I've checked out this kids channel and listened to his not afraid cover. It's nothing special to get 55 million views
I totally agree that he has a good voice and can sing well but there's nothing exceptional about his singing. There are tons of other struggling artist better than him in the world but the thing that made this kid huge was his DISABILITY
I'm not a hater or anything but as a struggling artist myself what really hurts is when a not more deserving person gets ahead of you only because people pity his disabled condition. 
I'm not gonna write anything more but  everyone who reads this comment, please give it a thought. Does this kid really deserve all this hype? is he really good enough to get such a huge amount of attention what many other better artists are struggling for? would this kid really be this famous if he wasn't disabled?
I hope you guys can understand what exactly I'm trying to convey, and judge a person on his level merit and not on his level of disability"

1,"Morale of story everyone has problem some big some small. Some talks about however large no  of people hides it. Why???fear that others will take advantage.  This mini micro intelligent has stood bravely in front of people to tell his story. People who dont accept your weakness dont deserve u. Its ok to fail because u rise and shine brighter than x
Sun. Tell me a celebrity, businessman, multimillionaire  who have not failed. How many of these were not mocked.  But what kept them going is faith in themselves  nd creator. In west no one is a failure because a failed person has opportunity to be a business tycon in few years. Why is there difference in india and other Asian countries.  People in india acts like westerners but if u ask us ............ please keep up brave tycon u have set fine  example this will help others to see  best in themselves and shine"

1,"His jokes were really awkward. If anybody laughed, they would be met with stares, and if anybody did not laugh they would be met with outraged people thinking he/she/they did not appreciate his speech. Instead his jokes were met with awkward silence or coughing. Despite this, however, I admire his outgoing personality, as well as his speech, and I believe that he is a person to look up to."

1,"What a great inspiration he is! When I was 18, I had a vacation job in a home for physically and mentally disabled children. It was one of the toughest things I've seen. The kids in the ""bed"" section were of all ages, up to 17 years, but they would never walk.... spend all their existence in a little bed. Their parents had all abandoned them, and nobody else wanted them, either. So the nurses there were the only ones caring for them. One little girl, the size of a one year old, who was actually 9 years old, had also what we called ""glass bones"", just like this boy. Except she had never had a family, who would believe in her, speak to her... nothing at all. The nurses never talked to the kids, they just cared for their bodily well being: feeding, washing, cleaning up diapers, giving medications.
I started to play with the kids, and they began to react to me, smiling mostly, as almost all could not move their body at all. I was sure that these children knew every one and who interacted with them or not. I managed to develop a real relationship with hand signs on my part, and mostly smiles or eye movements from the kids. The nurses and doctors were surprised to see the kids responding to me. It had never occurred to them to try it. I for one will never forget any of these children, they live on in my memory and my heart."

1,"another self congratulatory speech from TED talk. he's a bright kid, basic singing voice, with the personality of an underdeveloped adult. millions of kid are like this, but with a better voice. are we granting this kid over the others because he has a rare illness? we might call this exploitation, or the modern circus of today.

i don't see what he has to offer but platitudes and milking his disability.

what made me comment is the overly bombastic responses that clearly project a phony layer we put on to people like him. if i were in his shoes, i'd cringe if i saw these comments."

1,Great man! Who could put dislikes to this video?!
2,he has million dollar smile
1,This young man  has more charisma and intellect at such a young age that many don't even exhibit even in their 70s.  The audience don't clap simply because many in the audience if this is in India don't have a sense of humor and don't get his puns or they're just totally clueless.  Ted Talks are some of the very intellectually challenging conversations if you aren't versed in science and many aspects of the conversation or topics.
1,"I saw it after 4 years,from my school teachers.U R GREATEST BOY. PURHYTHUMstar-struckstar-struck"
1,"Awesome way of turning impossible to I'm possible.  No matter how much pain he is suffering he always finds a way to move forward and ignore it. I also like the way he never gives up on what he truly likes. He has an awesome voice too. :) Also, a funny thing is that whenever he said I joke I would laugh but the audience wouldn't. The audience would always laugh at the wrong time."

1,This child is clearly humanity in its purest form...it is indeed true that life is very short..so why waste time sobbing about the flaws with which god sent us.... rather start living and celebrating life with what God has given us and most importantly make the most out of it..live our life in such a way that the word 'impossible' doesn't even mean anything..

1,"So how come I had more modest difficulties (OCD, socialization difficulty due to other psych. problems) but couldn't seem to get the drive to do a bunch of stuff this early? Where does that _drive_ come from in some cases but not others? Why is it there in only some cases but not all cases? Instead of putting my own will power toward my own talent area (math, computer programming) as much as possible I instead stuck it hard to argue and debate against the bullies that kept coming my way and spent countless hours and years fighting bullies instead of just blowing them off when they were all over internets, and so could have been dismissed with the click of a mouse but NO, I OCD'd on fighting it forever and ever. How does will and drive work, that it can drive so hard on something so pointless, but drive much less on something pointFUL? And conversely, what makes it able to drive on something pointFUL like in this other case, as opposed to something pointLESS? Maybe OCD just wasn't challenging enough a psych problem, not as good a challenge as having all the bones broken? Could adversity be a ""talent"" of its own right in a strange, perverse sense of the word? Why would a huge problem here not stop him but a smaller problem on my side have to make it take 26 years and I'm still having difficulties?"

1,"what is it about god that makes you feel that you were worth something, imagine if it was your body which was able to heal itself and the wonders of the human body within you to move on. whats up with god in every single thing man, i dont care if he/she is a divine being or if i die tomm but always believing that god did this god did that blah blah is not the way to some your problems. my parents used to say to me that if i dont study and pray to god that bad things will happen. i dont get great grades but i frankly dont give a damn the thing that i learnt in life is to always think and believe in yourself and listen to your conscience not some great all powerful unearthly being telling me what to do. have the confidence to move on no matter what, thats what matters! ( yes i dont care if i didnt put G in caps)"

1,"Kid of rich parents, see the support u got.
He's confident with speaking, cause of all pampering.. No beating, no scolding.

Too much of unwanted hype, he's just sick.. and only thing he has done is music, that's why he's good with music, he has worked on his interest.

First point he says, follow your passion.. In India, following passion other than what your parent says is disobeying them xD
If ur parent may had supported u like him, u would be in his place.

Don't compare urself.

hate me, but try to realize the truth."

1,Stephen Hawkins has been resurrected
1,"Should I feel bad for being content with what others might perceive as a boring life? Should I pursue something big or special even though I don't want to? Is there anything wrong with NOT caring about whether or not I'll be remebered by future generations? To leave no mark on this world?

I don't want to do anything ""cool"" or ""interesting"" or ""extraordinary"" with my life. I just want to play video games and watch tv. But society looks down on that. Society always tells us we should do something ""meaningful"" or ""productive"" with our lives, to have interesting hobbies or work we're passionate about.

I wish I was that type of person, but I'm just not. I wish I had a passion for something ""cool"" like music or science or art, but I just don't. I'm the most ""boring"" person you'll ever meet, and that makes me feel bad. It makes me feel bad because society constantly tells me I'm supposed to be ""interesting"" in some way. Ironically enough, society also tells me to screw what society thinks. So which is it?

I don't even know why I'm writing this. Just thinking aloud I guess."

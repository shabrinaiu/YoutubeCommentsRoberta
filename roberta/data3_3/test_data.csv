Like you I also encourage people to do the same 4 steps you are teaching. I think at the core of what we are teaching that is fundamentally the same is that we are bigger than our circumstances, so dare to dream and dreambig and dreambuild not just fantasize about it but do it. Life is possible because we can decide and choose for ourselves what to make of it. That power of personal agency is the greatest give God gives us all next to life and breath itself. Keep rockin Sparsh! I'm with you."

1,"I am a muslim . Today I will like to introduce few aspects of religion Islam to you . 
Few of our beliefs are as follows 
1. We believe God is one . He has no partners. He neither begets , nor is begotten. 
2. We believe in all the prophets of God sent on earth for guidance of people . It includes many prophets,  few of them are Hazrat Ibrahim ( peace be upon him ) , Hazrat Ismail ( peace be upon him, ) , Hazrat Eesa (Jesus)( peace be upon him) and finally Hazrat Muhammad (peace be upon him)
3. We believe in all the angels , they are also creation of God.
4. We believe there is a day of Judgment 
5. We believe , all mankind will be made alive again by God after death, on the day of judgment. 
6. We believe that all mankind is answerable for the deeds which they do in this life in the afterlife.
7. We believe there is a Paradise made by God.
8. We believe Paradise is very beautiful and it has everything which gives comfort to a person.
9. We believe God has no son and no father. He is the only God. He forgives all sins whichever He wills but do not forgive shirk. Shirk means worshiping anyone other than God , may it be sun or fire or any personality. Also associating partners with God is shirk. Idolatry is also shirk. Shirk can be forgiven if someone ask forgiveness from God and decides to never do shirk in his life.
10. We believe God will enter believers with good deeds into Paradise in the afterlife.
11.  We believe in all books sent by God . It includes Taurat given to Hazrat Musa( Moses) ( peace be upon him) , Zaboor given to Hazrat Daud ( peace be upon him),  Injeel( Gospel ) given to Hazrat Eesa( Jesus ) peace be upon him) and Quran given to Muhammad ( peace be upon him).
 We have five obligations as a muslim to fulfill.
1. 1st is kalima , it is belief that there is only one God and Muhammad ( peace be upon him) is His messenger.  After believing in this a person becomes a muslim. 
2 . 2nd is Salah . We perform Salah five times a day. It is performed in arabic in a specific 
way . It is performed in mosque by men and at home by women , mostly .
3. 3rd is Fasting , it is done for 1 month in a complete year . In this we leave eating or drinking anything from early morning till evening. Then eat and drink till next early morning 
4. 4th is zakat , it is giving 2. 5 percent of free wealth to poor people,  once in a year . It is obligatory for those who have a certain amount of free wealth. 
5 . 5th is Hajj . It is performed in a specific way in Mecca . It is obligatory once in a lifetime for those who can afford to go and come back from Mecca .
 We also believe in huqooq al ebad.  Means rights of people . Means being nice to neighbors,  do not harm an innocent,  being obedient to parents except if they tell something against Islam . But in every case we will behave very nicely with them . And many more .
I invite everyone of you to accept Islam . 
Thanks for reading."

He doesn't want your pity he wants to be treated like everybody else. By not laughing it is actually more hurtful as you are treating him different and with white gloves or implying the joke wasn't funny.  Either way it was bad.

1,Em I have one question. How to learn better even if our emotion is not in a good condition? Could we trick our mind so that we could learn better? Or should we just rest for a little while and wait for our emotion to be in its best condition?
1,Mentally I feel that much better now just listening to this
2,Many thanks

1,"This Video Is Awesome, including Jim Kwik. Help me, Jim Kwik.A Simple Tour To My Life, 100% you wanted to call Asylum on me: F - is something I'm too 'good' at after teaching my friends about something, plus thanks for ISIS and other horrible stuff and things, I, I mean we cannot ignore that and just say let's study without any Distractions!A - occupies 3/8+ of my day throughout my ""highschool life""(since I've Never Exercise These Days, Never Join Outdoor Activities and Shut Myself In Bedoom 3/8+ of 24hours To Do Notes of My Study, By The Means of Doing Notes, I'm Actually Copying The Whole Textbooks for Chemistry, Biology and Physics).S - I'm Confused(since I don't know if ""stress"" is the word for this feeling + I Score 2 for Laziness, 0 on Anxiety and 0 for Stress in a 30-Question-Based Psychology Test In School + I think +50% of the population will fail this Never Have I Ever Searched For or Know The Definition of The Word ""Stress"", I've only learned that in Science Class stress=pressure, Pressure is a measure of how focused a force is in a given place, and depends on the magnitude of the force and the surface area acting over it >XD), happy, sad and mostly emotionless, so yeah, my work in 3/8+ of 24 hours x 0 = 0???T - Jim Kwik, the worst approach for the One and Only Me, I immediately forget the content of a certain topic after I teach my friends about a topic like Psychology shows, and so on. I even struggle to recall them. As a human, it made me think that its BEST not to teach everyone because once I taught people in a Comprehensive Way Down To The Smallest Details, I Will Forget Them, This Made Me Think They Are The Ones Who Benefited From Me and I Benefited Nothing from ""Sharing"", plus I Have To Watch The Whole Documentary All Over Again In Order To Gain All That Knowledge Back! It's like a Pre-programmed ""Knowledge Exterminator"" In My Brain Gets Triggered every single time I shared Amazing Scientific Knowledge with people!!"

Anyways, I ONLY came to this channel so I could leave a reply and voice my complete annoyance and frustration moments ago when your ad popped up while I was trying to leave a comment on a video that was extremely important and detrimental to people’s health and livelihood as many are dying from this EEE virus crud and all I heard in the background  was your nonstop voice talking a mile a minute about this ad on “speed learning,” and I swear you never took a single breath. It literally drove me so crazy, I stopped what I was doing that was important and looked this up, thinking  “what in the world ....”face_with_rolling_eyesface_with_rolling_eyes
Nonetheless, that’s why I am commenting and looked this crap up.. And due to my annoyance that now has turned to terrible anxiety,  I will never even think of reading your information nor attending some webinar for such... 
Please SLOW your roll, take a breath..and chill... 
Geesh..
I know it’s “speed learning,” and all, face_with_rolling_eyesface_with_tears_of_joybut your speed talking, without a single breath was quite nerve wracking..."

1,"bouquet *God says about himself :*

1. Say, O Messenger: He is Allah who is alone in being a deity. There is no deity except Him. 

2. He is the master to whom belongs all sovereignty and perfect, beautiful qualities. The one to whom all creation turn to. 
   
3. The one who did not give birth to anyone, nor did anyone give birth to Him. So He has no offspring - may He be glorified - nor any parent. 
   
4. Nor does He have any equal from His creation.

1,"Waste of Time:
I tried speed reading trial class.  It starts with Jim's history and some stories.
Who cares about his story? Rather than teaching speed reading and increasing comprehension, class starts with stupid conversation about history of Jim and his student and etc for around half an hour. 


Student (Vishen) speaks more than the teacher (Jim). Vishen appears dramatic and unreal student. It appears that his responses are already scripted. 

2 ideas presented for speed reading:
1. Use pointer
2. Avoid sub-vocalization.


These 2 things are already available on the internet. I have read articles that presented these 2 ideas. Nothing new. 




Waste of an hour."

*FAST*
+ FORGET:
Forget What you already know. start with a beginners mind. Forget what's going on in the world. forget about your limitations.
+ ACTIVE:
You brain doesn't learn through consumption you brain learns through creation, be active.
+ STATE= current mood of your mind&body:
Information + emotion = long-term memory. All learning is state dependant. Control your state to learn more. You are a thermostat not a thermometer. With great responsibility(controlling how we fell) comes great power. Trade your cleverness for bewilderment. 
+ TEACH :
When you teach something you get to learn it twice."

I had to learn computer programming and coding, hours at a time throughout a couple of weeks just to teach it the next day and I learned it so much faster then if I was just sitting there to learn It just to have as a skill which probably would have taken months and months in comparison"

1,Thanks a lot jim you make a revolution in my life....
1,"the greatest power to be success in anything is to control your emotion.. but that's the biggest obstacle of our life. This was also pretty much accepted in religion in the past. To attain enlightenment is to be able to drain out all your emotion. This will also unleash your greatest potential that u can never achieve in life. Seems that information are very much easy to access these days with no boundaries, but the ability to contain those big gigantic pool of information is literally impossible. Though we can learn the smart way by picking what is more important. Not trying to be a sponge to absorb everything that u can't and become overloaded."

1,"OMG! Now I want to go back in time re-do school and re-write my exams with my current mindset.
Why don't schools upgrade their teaching game? - I mean I quite literally wanted to hang myself every morning waking up to go to school.
The number one factor motivating children to go to school is 'meeting up with the class-mates, friends and new people' and not actually to 'learn'.


MindValley team you need to run the school systems globally! 
I'm not necessarily saying ""close down the current schools by opening new ones"", I am saying ""communicate to the school and have them change their teaching systems, teaching methods, motivating factors, create total engagement and maximize learning probabilities and reduce learning time (or learning curve). Teach them how to teach. 
Perhaps then the next generations won't have to endure such agonizing school environments and waste young, fresh ages of their lives.


I enjoyed school, but I would have enjoyed it WAY better."
1,"when he said what subject do u want to learn fast
I immediately screamed PHYSICS AND HISTORY"

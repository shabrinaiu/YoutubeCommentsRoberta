1,That’s why there is a saying instead of all this complex thinking “It’s all about how you see” and confucius said something similar to this “A lion chased me up to a tree and i greatly enjoyed the view from the top” It’s just all about how we choose to see.

John 14: 21 He who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will disclose Myself to him.” 22 Judas (not Iscariot) *said to Him, “Lord, what then has happened that You are going to disclose Yourself to us and not to the world?” 23 Jesus answered and said to him, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our abode with him. 24 He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father’s who sent Me.

2,Great talk red_heart
2,this taught me so much. Thank you!!
1,As a teacher this comes automatically.
1,"In the book ""13 things mentally strong people don't do"" by Amy Morin there is also this topic . I think his strategies are valid but I would add one more, one that I've learned by reading the book I talked about earlier: try to rationalise what other people say about you. Why do they say what they say about you? If someone comes to you at work and says ""You are not working hard enough"" try to analyse what it means. Try to think if it's true. Analyse the hours of work, try to remember in which state of mind you are while working and if you are productive, try to think rationally to know if the other person is right and what is saying is true. If it's true then you should just think about it and try to become a better worker. If it's not true then you really don't have to bother about what the other person said because you analysed the way you work and you KNOW it's not true. In the case of a referee (even if during a match he doesn't really have the time to analyse everything the audience says) he could think about the way he took decisions. I hope this will bring you more confidence! Keep up!"
2,What a nice guy!

1,"I'm a high school teacher and I often find myself taking remarks and behaviour from students personally.  To focus on their intentions doesn't work. It's still about me. Even if I come to the conclusion that the reason for their disruption is boredom or just wanting to shake things up to look good, it's still about me. To  'speak up' and talk about how their remark hurts me doesn't work, because it obviously makes you look incredibly weak. It gives them the signal that their doing an effective job in bullying teachers."

1,What kind of accent does he have? It is quite easy to understand for Spanish people!
1,"Sometimes; it is really hard to have the control of our emotions, I'm 42 and get heated easily, I hate this;  younger I used to fight for nothing sometimes. I will practice not to take things personally and I know that I have to meditate deeply to achive it."
1,This is honestly one of the best ted talks ever..
1,"And you can use these same strategies in the situation that IT IS YOU CRITICISING YOURSELF. Use the two same strategies: “Heads - It is not about you”  maybe it is about what you think others would expect from you. “Tails - It is about you” maybe is a part of you that you are not yet happy with, a part that needs attention and empathy."

1,Can I really trust a ginger though? Just kidding I wasn't expecting the ginger joke in there during the talk. Was an interesting one. grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,The title is not a question. Why the question mark?
1,"I take some things personally even though I don't care what anyone thinks of me - especially when someone says badly about me. I don't think there is a person who knows who I really am, so I am not touched by someone else's opinions. Even flattering - sometimes people see me as good when I'm raging inside.

However, one thing irritates me, but it seems to me that the problem is not on my side.
I am irritated when I have to solve a problem, the solution of which I know and I am explaining it, and someone cuts in while still thinking what the answer may be. I think that maybe this person doesn't hear me or ignores me on purpose, but when I stop talking then he suddenly apologizes and asks me to finish because it is a good idea and then we all stand in silence and I say that I am done because when two people of speaking at the same time nothing clear will come out. It happens quite often and I wonder why."

1,"It is next to impossible to open up - without blaming the other. The whole point why we get upset by another's actions is there infraction onto our core  value.. but those values are not universally shared - and values are created from who we are and our childhoods. Therefore opening up and explaining that we are upset by another actions ultimately leads to blame - as the other does not feel that their action encroaches on your value set, or sometimes that you even had the right to the value in the first place, hence the blame and disagreement. Example. Someone honking behind you because you drive too slow. Ok. My value is driving carefully because my parents taught me to be diligent. This person is honking at me as he doesn't acknowledge my diligence as a value. He honks. Now I remember my brother and I have a problem with  authority figures - I did nothing wrong = being upset. I did take his horning at me personally as I feel I didn't do anything wrong and was keeping to the speed limit - the other person saw an open road and was upset as he perceived no risk from driving faster. Yes it was about my childhood, my values as I don't think I did anything wrong based on my values. If I were to explain this to him... it would be next to impossible to do so with out blaming him for honking in the first place..."

2,Brilliant!! It touched me!
1,This hit so different yet the right way! The last bit had me in tears tbh
1,"@ I had a buddy move to Colorado springs about 7 years ago and first week there he said someone was shot and killed for cutting another person off,.. in this case the person really was hunted in the end,. Even if you don't take something personally, doesn't mean the person next to you won't take it very personal,. Look at the riots over the incidences that caused them,. Thousand took it personally and didn't even live in the same country. I don't feel we have free speech anymore because people take things more personal than intended or just too personally for no reason. A guy could break into your house and kill a family member and run and the cops could shoot him,. In most normal cases people would be serves the criminal right or what did he expect was gonna happen after you kill someone. And then there's cases where people think just because he killed someone that the cops shouldn't have killed the criminal. Taking it Personally is in the perspective of the person and most people like to blow things way out of proportion,  like the covid pandemic,. The Spanish flu now that was a pandemic. Covid was just a bad flu season,. Trust me heart disease and cancer killed way more and that's not a pandemic yet"

It definitely needs some work but I love it nonetheless because it is mine and mine only... I felt attacked by the mere question that I cried my eyes out until I fell asleep. Maybe the person was raising this seeing how I'm always so reserved and unconfident ... Or it is about me... The fact that it is hard to look at myself in the mirror, take pictures and post them, wear fashionable clothes like girls my age or even walk down the street without my arms crossed and head pointed at the ground... But you see, these are things you can't tell people... As a girl who grew up without a mother around... there are things that affect the way you view yourself... But this guy brings an interesting idea to my head. It is so simple but hardly ever practiced. I'm not in need of sympathy, I just wanted to share my piece of story and tell you to stay strong."

1,"Hi Mr. Fred I just wanted to share somethings I've learned.  The way a person treats you shows you who they are, and the way you respond shows you who they are.   So, someone says you should leave your career of 15 yrs. because you are just not cut out for it.  That person may just be sick and tired of their job and want nothing else to do with it.  It's called self projection.  You spot it, you got it.  You name it, you claim it.  Lets say you go to a meeting out of town and you see someone there and think ""They don't like me because their not talking to me.""  In reality you are the one who doesn't like them, because no one told you that and you didn't hear it from them.  We are a reflection of each other.  If you examine yourself you will realize there is something about that person you don't like which is why you are the one not talking to them.  The ""I"" statement of therapy is one of my favorites.  Ex. I feel ""sad"" when you ""walk away as I'm talking"" because ""it makes me feel unimportant."" Or, I feel ""insecure"" when you ""come home late"" because ""It makes me feel that spending time together doesn't matter anymore.""  It's also about seeing your own self worth even if no one else does.  When you worked hard on that project that you were proud of and no one else acknowledged it, it's okay because you did your best, gave it your all and felt great about the outcome.  We can't control anyone else's feelings or emotions.  When you begin to build your self esteem you will be able to see when someone is honking and flashing their lights behind you, it's about them not you.  I usually think what's their problem, or, oh well that's between them and God.  When someone has a problem they have to deal with it not you.  So, unless your in the fast lane on the express way driving slow, then I would suggest moving over to a slower lane.  Sure our hearts will always race or jump when we are honked at, but again if they have a problem they can always go around or just continue feeling some type of way following behind you.  It's up to them.  You are not here to move, think or feel the way anyone else wants you to.  If your driving slow and just cruising on a Sunday afternoon, you have that right to enjoy yourself and there's nothing wrong with it.  If you grew up around people who were only concerned for their own profit or pleasure (you getting a 10 making them feel good) at others expense, then you may need to unlearn some negative learned behaviors. Make a conscious effort to listen to the words that come out of your mouth and if they sound familiar (like your parents) then put yourself in that other person's shoes and remember how it made you fee.  You didn't go through all that for nothing.  You are in your destiny and you are meant to impact the world to change for a better place.  Even if it is only within themselves.  Thank you and I hope you get a chance to read this long message.  Peace, love and strength I send to you......."

When I have a job that covers my expenses, when I have a safe place to stay that I can afford, when I have food to put in my mouth. Then and only then I will be silent, like I always have been and be nothing! Hopefully that will be soon! No one will hear about me unless professionally.

1,"Summary :
1. It's not about me- Think about the intentions of the other person 
E.G- In a football match when you make a refereeing decision, people don't agree and then start screaming at you, it's not about you, it's about them wanting to be right.
2. The constant need to feel like it's about you comes from a sense of insecurity of not being good enough. Practicing every time to not think it's about you at every critical juncture helps.
3. If you always think it is about you, draw on empathy for yourself and have a self aware discussion with yourself that sometimes you can make mistakes
4. Be empathetic and vulnerable so it's easier for you to know your needs as well as for people to understand where you are coming from."

1,"That doesn’t make sense to say « it’s not about me » because human beings do not connect sometimes energetically, so how when someone doesn’t have a good vibe about you , and they feel it with their intuition or their guts, that something is off.. or you do feel someone doesn’t like you.. it’s about you"

1,"Maybe Frederik would be better-off than other referees in spotting players faking their injuries, since he has studied theatre. I am amazed by the presentation and performance-skills though. (I knew he could act well, before I read his bio.)"
2,"Such a great  speech, I feel bad  we didn't  learn  all these stuff in school while we were still kids and fresh  we would all be better by now."
1,Maintaining that level of energy without having an answer is really impressive
1,"If you are a referee, then this philosophy is wise.  However, in everyday life, I wouldn't agree.  As a therapist, I have helped 1000s of people who were allowing themselves to be abused by others - friends, partner, family member, work colleague etc) - to take back their power and no longer allow the abuse.  Their life then transformed and they became happier.  The moral of the story - we must never allow others to abuse us in any way.  Everyone deserves respect."

1,This is the most connected I have felt with someone in months. Wow. Frederik is an excellent speaker and this topic is what I have struggled with the most through life. I always know the talk has made a lasting imprint if it's got me tearing up with happiness at the end lol. Like finding a solution to what eats at you the most.... or at least a two-way approach to handling it. Thank you so much.
1,Absolutely fantastic
2,what a really great advise. thank you!
1,"I just know that many people have psychological  issues, anger issues, and so many just aren't very smart.  So when someone does or says something that might normally make someone angry I just assume they have one of these issues because they usually do.  One way to look at it is to ask yourself: If this person had down syndrome would it bother me that they did that or said that?  Of course not.  I would simply feel sorry for them and maybe laugh to myself at what they did or said."
2,Great presentation; the end was a home-run.

1,The ending was awesome ...grinning_face_with_big_eyes
1,"I think being vulnerable in front of people that are bullies and have bad intentions is useless they could hurt you even more. Those two ways of dealing with what you re feeling emotionally are only good if the other person can actually understand your feelings, if not, they will try to hurt you even more to prove that they are right and confident and now more powerful. Im worried that this could be used as an manipulation."

1,Michael Jordan saw this . . . and still took it personal
1,"The take away here is we should all become football referees... j/k!!!  Great points Frederik and thank you for the closing imagery!!

My interpretations:
* Know it’s not about you. 
* INVESTIGATE/UNDERSTAND the other person’s intent behind their actions (or lack of intent to harm you)
* Recognize that you may feel personally affected because of some underlying need / precondition / inclination you have (e.g. need for praise, acceptance, etc). In which case have EMPATHY for yourself. 
* Communicate HOW you FEEL (objectively describe how you felt when they said/did something--without attacking/blaming the person). This will increase the odds of the person factoring in your feelings and also have empathy for you.
* No matter what people say or do at/to/around you, you will never lose your value. Like a dollar bill."

1,When he talked about the little boy telling his mom “I hate you” because she wouldn’t let him stay up later.....that’s when it really hit me. That it isn’t personal. That it’s because that kid wanted to stay up later. He doesn’t hate his mom- he hates rules and what is best for him.

1,I really related to this and found it helpful. All of the things he mentioned in examples…been there and done that! Totally going to try these two techniques out. With this talk I just realized by being vulnerable I’m actually being assertive..and so there is no need to get mad and become aggressive if the actual need for empathy is being met.
1,why have i never thought about it like this before what the..
1,print(challenge)
1,I like the example with the child. I know at times I take things personally with my oldest. To be honest i know it has nothing to do with her & everything to do with me. I’m in the process of healing because I never took the time to truly discipline myself with certain things. This was great to watch & love the ending message.
1,"But, I do mean it, personally, when I get mad about someone’s driving, decisions, habits, shortcomings, etc. so..? Why wouldn’t it be personal? I’m not being argumentative, I just don’t understand."
1,"These strategies are great, I've been doing this with my full consciousness but when you don't like yourself, these won't work, empathy to yourself is important and so is looking yourself, I'm trying every day and sometimes I'm successful and I feel very proud that I put my point without anyone's opinion because that is me, the only thing I have to accept is Me.

Q.Why do you still want this 20euroes 
A.Because it's still 20euroes!

1,"The fact is, Cryptocurrency is making financial waves and fighting against poverty in this modern era, and the question traders as them self is if this the right time to invest ? Before jumping into conclusion I think you should take a look at things first. For the past few days the price of Bitcoin has been fluctuating which means the Market is currently unstable and you can't tell if it is going bearish or bullish. While others Still continue to trade without the fear of making loss, others are been patient. It all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signal. I would say trading has been going smoothly for me , I started with 1.5 BTC and I have accumulated over 6.7BTC within 3 weeks with the trading strategies given to me by Expert Catherine Ruslan Her method are top notch and profitable, obviously he's the best.

1,"So so inspiring, it’s a perspective I discuss with my patients in session and this man summed it up perfectly, in a very positive and friendly way grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes The coin metaphor is amazing!"
1,"“People may attack you, criticise you, or ignore you. They can crumple you up with their words, spit you out, or even walk all over you. But remember, whatever they do or say, you will always keep your value.” - This just hit me so hard. When I take things personally, I always get mad and  sometimes fight back ( argue) with the person talked about me (of course things got worse) but after realizing what he said, the more I fight back the more value I lost (wasting my time and becoming more toxic, harmful person). 
Thank you for this incredible TEDtalk, it help me a lot  in becoming a better man"

1,"Sometimes it's neither about you or the issues of the other.... sometimes it's about society. Getting recognition is also often connected to money, so it's a myth by someone who can just decide to become a referee, which is a priviledge for most people, who are not male and white and from a socially and finacially stable family. So good for you and your ego. Doesn't really work in real life. I am allowed to be mad about stuff on a personal level, to fight this system."
1,"Great and inspiring. Loved this man's honesty, compassion and complexed approach.. very useful wonderful talk"

1,"It's easy... If they don't know you personally, whatever they say won't affect you in any way because you know deep in yourself who you really are. The things they say will probably just ricochet back to them. They can't penetrate inside your mind and emotions if you don’t permit them to. It bothers them even more when you don't react the way they want you to. That's your power, and YOU'RE THE ONE HOLDING IT, NOT THEM. Stay unbothered."

1,"I am recently working as middle school teacher. You know, depending on the field, you will find related issues. I like creating and working with Youngs, but the dark side is classes who misbehave badly and tend to offend the teacher.
Well, the first months were a tragedy.... I realized I was taking it too personally when, one day, one of those kids changed her vote on a test I corrected. Few days later a colleague told me she had worse with three kids falsificating her documents. It clicked something in me: woh, I should not take it personally, otherwise you can't get out alive! Not only the referee is a good job to practice what Frederick said: try to spend a semester with kids who aren't Willing to work with you, they laugh and say things at your back, they claim you are not good for the job... Yet, you have to manage parents who still treat them as children and never give up on let them see ""that's the way"", if you want to work it out."

1,You should (!) take some things personally!
1,"But even when me changes to we , how much time we have to wait for things to get clarified, that drives me crazy"
1,"I work in the Discipline department in a HS and I can say we need more of this in our schools. I have been to some classes and they're literally boring students to death. I have a 2-year old and I'd rather have her watch TedTalks like this one than taking some ""classes"" she will learn nothing from in the future. We need to teach this to our youth."
2,I love the 20 Euros example. I will remember that one.
1,what a beautiful soul!
2,I love it how he's just answering to most comments
1,MJ needs to meet this man
1,Amazing hundred_pointsred_heart Everybody needs to hear this. People are soo hurt nowadays due to unwanted reasons bcz they dont address them properly.
2,That makes a lot of sense. Thanks!!
2,god he just makes me smile in the end . i wish he have a lot of pep talk i will listen to him without even rolling my eyes sush a smart wise man god bless you
1,"Great talk, simple lessons but hard to put into practice. I used to struggle a lot with this when I was younger, but now I usually manage to take a step back and keep in mind that we simply cannot control other people's thoughts, words or actions and operating under the futile belief that we can just makes us miserable.

If someone criticises your project, take on board the learning to do better in future but still reflect on how you did a good job. If someone gets angry at you for a small thing that you didn't mean and it's blown out of proportion that's down to them and not you. If someone rejects you for a date then they either don't think you're a good match or they don't see your value, either way that's no reflection on you. Remember none of us is perfect and we all make mistakes. Also remember you are always valued, even in the unlikely event that you are the only person who truly values you that's still one person! 

Appreciate the football analogies here too, although either the insults were toned down to be acceptable in a TED talk or the league this man refs in is exceptionally polite.
There's a lot of F words used in Sunday league but they're not 'fishing'!"
2,Some parts of this talk made me sad for him but on the other hand this man is genuinely a cool guy. I enjoyed this talk
1,This guy is good. Deep down thought this would be meh because he's a sports guy but guess I fooled myself.
1,"No it's not that I want to be right but that I want things to fit together, to be cohesive, to connect, logic, flow..."
1,Such an amazing msg. Eye opener.
1,"Frederik,
A big thank you for being so mart and generous to share your findings!
You helped me today, a lot…
You deserve you million of views."
1,YouTube algorithms took this personally...
1,i am really really grateful to have access to this much knowledge
1,"If it sounds personal it most probably is , take it seriously, hower stay quite, come back later to clean it up. People who attack at a personal level are testing to go farther, to intensify to verbal abuse and perhaps physical abuse."
1,"At the end of the talk, when he said whatever they do to you, uncrumpled the money and said, you will always keep your value. It hits really hard smiling_face_with_tear"

2,"This is so super good,, his personality and the message is so on point."
1,Answer is simple - stop caring what others think of you. BOOM!
1,"The pumped step-aunt systematically disappear because turnip biochemically lighten against a doubtful theater. heartbreaking, shivering wheel"
1,I think in today’s world it’s more positive to challenge people to not be so offensive and inconsiderate with others. Those are the people who tend to tell others not to take things personally.
1,"1. It's not about me.
2. It's about me by speaking up."
1,The ending is everything raising_handsraising_handsraising_hands
1,"Thanks very much Frederik. I take all things personally. specially when i am ignored or criticised.
I will try my best to improve.
But seriously i took all this speech personally."
1,Best tedtalk I watched. Thankyou I will always keep my value red_heart
1,"I get what he’s saying but at the same time how does this translate into addressing someone who did something that was rude or hurt you. Do you bring up the topic? Because if you do, then you are taking it personally? But how do you continued that  relationship or friendship with that hanging over your head?"
1,"You are really good at speaking it is like.. I feel you! Like, you look very empathic.
Thanks, you voice tone is like listening a fairy tail. 
Is hard sometimes, in my case I like to think there are some ppl and children who dont haveenough food or wster or who doesnt hVe family or friends or education.
Its not easy but little by little maybe I can improve is this"
1,"he has a point, We keep our value, even if we are on the bottom, i defenetly learned somthing here, and would never have thougth i would watch this whole video from start to the end but i did, so yes lets go..."
1,what if they tear me apart?
1,Wow such an amazing video and speech!! Made me smile. I really need not to take things personally
1,"Try not to take this personally,  but how many times did you/ her say personally? You can be right or you can be happy. Late comedian Ralph May."

""... In theory""

Me: oh"
1,You always keep your value. That's wisdom.
2,WOW ... i love this episode
1,"That was really good. grinning_face
Regarding the EGO my perspective really changed when last year i visited Longmen grotto Buddhist site in China. I learned that other than training GOOD to win over BAD one should remove the SELF to achieve lasting peace.
The question was: how could I do it if I still live in this buzzing society?
I eventually settled for completely removing the SELF from social setting, allowing it to come back into my body while I spend lots of my time on my own. My SELF can be as wild as he likes when I am alone, but MUST subside in all social settings.
So far it kind of worked, with only a few lapses. face_with_tears_of_joy"

2,Wonderful. Thank YOU.
1,And I took this personally....
1,This is so close to the daily life analogy. What a powerful end after all we take things personally unconsciously. The great TedTalk and luckily I watched it. I guess Frederik practised these self-scripts throughout his entire life to be mental prepared with criticisms and people's judgement. Awesome.

1,Damn!! He is a very good speaker and now I just want to understand the others perspective rather than always arguing to prove that I am right
1,So he’s saying that we should have empathy but the other person who doesn’t that impacts you is ok …..
0,The video has bad background static sound and hurt my ears. And I take it personally !
1,"if you don't - calmy, non-aggressively - be verbal and communicate clearly how you're thinking/feeling if someone hurts you or something goes wrong, the other person/people will likely never know about how you're feeling or the situation and so won't know or understand. Don't assume the other person can read your mind or is thinking/seeing things exactly as you do. It may be someone else's responsibility for their words if they said or did something harsh or mean to you, but you're the only one who is ultimately responsible for managing your feelings and thoughts afterwards. It's you're responsibility to do what you need to protect yourself (and others), be heard and be vocal (non-abusively) about your issues, so they have more of a chance of being solved.

If the other person then doesn't listen, deny or straight up ignores you, then that's a separate issue. Again, not to take personally. Don't immediately assume they fight you because they are trying to be an enemy to you. Take a moment to BREATHE (it's always important to remember to control your breathing when frustrated or anxious) and consider there may be other factors - which you may or may not be aware of - that mean they aren't able to listen to you or agree with you, and it may not be their (or even your) fault. But AGAIN, this can't be solved unless you're VOCAL, OPEN, show some EMPATHY (to yourself as well as the other person), and COMMUNICATE. Also though, give some BREATHING SPACE for yourself and the other person, and don't pressure someone or let someone pressure you into talking until both you and the other feel okay to."
1,Life is too short to take things too personal.  It's not that serious sometimes blossomsmile and say :oh well   it's them not me
1,"I’m using your experience already for a while, there is only one thing that can go wrong in all of it. Let’s continue with the story with inattention while you were talking to someone. What if you talked it out, you said you felt bad when the other person didn’t listen… and you get back the “no, it was not like this”. And then it happens 100 times like this? It’s your husband/wife, how to stay happy (not right) in that case?"

1,So if a family member says and does mean things to me how do I not take it personally? Random people don't offend me easily.
1,"How not to take things personally?  First, stop looking to others to get filled up.  Secondly, ask ""Who am 'I' really?  Am I this body, this mind? or am I simply that which witnesses this body and mind drama?  What if there never was anyone inside?  Only spacious Presence. Spacious awareness just taking it all in.  What if there were no-one inside to which anything pertains?  Just wide open awareness that has been mis-identified with the body/mind?    Sit quietly. Be calm.  Be outside or in the living room, eyes open or closed.  ask: Who is ""other""?  And just be the pause....just be the spacious pause of introspection."

I would see it as that person having lied to me, disrespected me and not liking me. 

How could anyone see it any differently?!

I have often tried to explain to others how they have made me feel - they don't care! They often tell me to f*** off!

My experiences cause me to respectfully disagree with Frederik."

1,Just dont take it personally if you think they are talking about you because you might just think like wow this seems so much like the person I am then you feel like you under attack.  Then you wonder if this was some how intended for you then you just start overthinking everything.  Just take it personally if you feel you need to.

Also, the first strategy ""it is not about me"" works best with people who you don't know.
The second strategy ""give yourself some empathy"" works best with people who are close to you. Or with whom you can be comfortable or vulnerable with.

Wow, this man is a genius. Good explanation Sir."

1,"Notes
2 sides to a coin that could help you 

Heads
1. It’s not about me, it’s about we
Think of the others intentions 
Takes effort and training to correct your negative thoughts 
Give yourself a pep talk

Tails
2. It is about me 
Give yourself some compassion 
Share with others what’s happening if you feel something. Use I statements 
It has to do with my insecurity or something I haven’t accepted
If something hits you a certain way it’s because there might be something that needs to be addressed
Could be rooted in your childhood."
1,"This one seems only half correct. The conclusion is absolutely correct but certain roads you take to get there are way off. I mean this all from my perspective of course. We reached the same conclusion but took different roads to get there. For you it seems ego is the biggest perpetrator but for me it's insecurity. Thinking I'm not good enough.Weed didn't exactly help that but I have since quit and my life has been so happy. I still take issue with certain people not responding but instead of lashing out I just ignore it. I have better things to do than worry about what people think of me. One video that helped me get through this is a video by Kurzgesagt or in a nutshell on youtube. It's about loneliness and it describes what you mean perfectly.
Still, you provide an out whereas Kurzgesagt does not. But watching both might still be beneficial. Kurzgesagt, sponsor me will you? I'll plug you all day every day you're soo good (as if they're gonna see this XD). Anyway I hope this adds something instead of being annoying to people but I can't predict how people will react now can I? Have an awesome day either way ^^"

1,"I will not apologise for taking this personally , and is one the reason i absolutely hate christianity.

In 1788 when white genocidal christians landed in Australia, They where horrified that woman in Aboriginal society had equal standing with men, they where included in all civil matters including law, These white christians then started killing whole Aboriginal communities, Men woman children new born`s because my people refused to deny the rights of woman who had had those rights for over 65,000 years.
 I know you cant forgive yourself because it was your ancestors that done this, white eurotrash.
I will and can never not take this personally  attempt bye white christian invaders to wipe my people out, Given a chance i would return the favour in kind.
because i run into white christian`s with the same attitude as the invaders to this day.

1,"Stop caring, what others think about you. Instead, figure out, what YOU think about YOURSELF and work on it to think better of yourself. Because for people to value you, you must first learn to value yourself. If you value yourself and do not care, what others think, you won´t be so easy to offend or trigger. Even a personal attack may cause you to burst in laugh (which may actually offend the other side more than fists and rage). Work on your personal integrity, get a better understanding of yourself - of your needs, wants, pros and cons.

If people are not interested in you, go away. Those are not worth your time."
1,"The truth is that people are too busy thinking about their own live, issues etc. They don't care about you. 
So if you suspect someone gossiping, ignoring or you did a bad presentation in front of a class and been laughed at. They'll forget all about it the next minute because they are too busy with their thoughts too."

But still, great video with practical and logical explanations."

I am extremely sensitive to people's words and tear up easily NOT IN FRONT OF THEM, privately ONLY. I am trying to not take them personally and so I liked this video.

1,"First lesson: 
You take things personally because of your ego, it's because you want to be right. 

Second lesson:
Try to see the situation from the perspective of the other person.

Third lesson:
When you get criticized or shouted at, it is because the others just want to be right.

Fourth lesson:
Give yourself empathy and speak up.

Fifth lesson:
Whatever the others do our say, you will always keep your value."

1,How to not take things personally in a nutshell: be a referee
1,There is a high pitched noise in the background ruined me
1,Good talk. But not put 20 euro into your mouth
1,"I struggled with taking things personally for a long time. When someone criticized my work, I would react with uninhibited aggression. I would be furious. I would be seething for days. But over the years, I sort of became immune to criticism. I stopped giving criticism that much value. I just continued creating stuff, writing stories, taking pictures, doing covers for the fun it. I realized that the reason I took things personally was because I cared too much about what other people say. Now when someone mocks me or slates my work, I either reply with light sarcasm or ignore the gibe completely and continue with whatever I'm doing at the moment."
1,"A much needed talk. red_heartred_heartred_heartred_heartred_heartred_heart 
It teaches you 2 things. 
1. Perspective is everything. Shift your perspective and you  are shifting towards a happier you. 
2. You are responsible for what you are feeling. Nobody else is. Decide, you want to let that bury you or you want to grow out from it."
1,He didn’t take the crowd personally because maybe they were trying to listen really hard
1,"I knew there was something about taking offense from others, just didn't realize it came from ego. So many things come from that and I want to fix them in myself. Glad to hear this talk. My friend is teaching me to wish others well, so when I was on a bike path that sites next to a walking path, I noticed a couple walking a dog on the bike path. Rather than being angry, I thought about how crowded the walking path was and thought maybe the dog was bothering everyone. It might npt be true but kept me from getting upset at those people. Now I just have to work on the same thing for people closer to me."
2,"Thanks man red_heart “no one has power over you, you’re free!”"
1,This is a horrible way to learn to not take things personally. When you are hired to do a job it is your job to not take things personally. How you apply that to life and the people who are around you and the ones that you love who manipulate you and hurt you it's not the same thing as standing on the field and taking barrages of insults from strangers and people you don't know. Horrible speech I'm starting to realize most of these TED talks are bullcrap
1,"For me who always takes things personally, this is a much needed advice. thank you!"
2,"“They want to be right and they want their team to win” that makes a lot of sense, it doesn’t mean that there’s anything wrong with you as a person, you are doing your best to do your job as best you can"

1,"The irony, like others said, is that this have hit me personally. I struggle everyday with that and also this risked my relationships so many times. It's funny because you obviously see the patterns of it on others, but when its on yourself, its a lot harder than you think. You know you took it personally when it already happened and sometimes it already had an impact, which can be complicated.

This is a daily exercise. I loved it. I work hard on this every and each day. I strive to be better at this, because it's just like Frederik said: sometimes those are things that hurt your ego, but they shouldn't when they're not really about you. 

Thank you for your wise words. It's funny because it felt so obvious, but still so mind-opening, because even the obvious sometimes needs to be said so it can be really acknowledged. The world doesn't turn around you or me. Deal with it."

1. For biological threats (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites) the immune system fights them off. 
2. For physical threats (violence, being attacked by a predator, too hot or cold) the fight/flight/freeze/fawn response fights them off. 
3. For word threats, emotional threats, I do know that fight/flight fights them off, but it doesn't work. What system handles that? I know mine is broken (as is my immune to an extent and my fight/flight), so I must learn how to strengthen it or calm it down. I have methods to calm down the other two or strengthen them to be more realistic, but I don't even know the name of this third hidden defense mechanism. It's obviously there but what's it called? How do I regulate it?"

Yeah I do take things personally....and it does hurts...
The time when four of my friends went to the fair without asking me once....I took that personally.....
Whenever my girlfriend shares her sadness with our friend  but not me.....I took that personally....I thought I don't worth it.....I'm a bad lover.....I can't be good for anyone......and I never spoke or told anyone anything, I don't dare to. 
But today.....I just want to think....that maybe they didn't ask me cause they thought I wouldn't go(as I am not a very outgoing person).....
And maybe my gf finds it easier to share her story with our friend as she(our friend) gives amazing suggestions.....so she(my gf) can get out of her problem easily.......

Yeah there will be a lot of incidents that I'll take personally but I'll always say to myself that ""this is not about me"".....and if it's about me....then I'll work it out.....

1,"Uff! What a great TED Talk! I do find this difficult to adopt and wrap my head around completely. What, conversely, is one ""entitled"" to take personally? Really absolutely nothing?

I would say taking something personally / being offended is at times (where the facts and circumstances are clear) very legitimate and probably even healthy? If someone stomps on me and I don't get offended, it would be likely to happen again no? Taking offence seems to be one form of self-preservation...At some point, after enough wear, even those 20 Euro will be discarded by the bank and replaced. Thoughts?"

1,"I understand everything he (and others) said; I always give people the benefit of doubt. But would you not take certain things personally in other cases, e.g. outright injustices against you? How can a normal human being not take something personally that were specifically targeting against them personally? Should injustices be left alone and victims just move on without a peep, i.e. suffer and bear the consequences in silence? This is a genuine question."

When these personal attacks start to threaten the things we hold most precious, we need a Savior who can honestly say that they are against Him and not you.

2,i love his speech
1,His conclusion with the banknote was priceless
1,I wish I listened to this 30 years ago.
2,Unfortunately not everyones intentions are good. How people treat you says more about them than it does about you. good or bad.
1,But its hard when its clear that other person intention is just to bully you or make fun of you... Then can't say it's not about me..!  Example some people who just Watching others and jump to shout and be a rule man for others only.. Without showing any understanding and say the thing in nice way..   Than you alsk can not take that out is about me... But not much i can  correct myself. Many people take being mini aggressive is their defense pattern.. I keep on trying see others perspectives and if something i need to learn or can do but. Emotionally at times one need understanding and feel alone and guilty. Its exhausting and then you end up feeling every one ks pointing up finger in you like a painting hanging on a train platform...  I am trying for years but it is exhausting...
1,For years I never spoke up and was walked all over...so I started speaking up and they walked away....there is no winning it seems...

1,Tq very useful to me
1,The Conclusion Is Everything..!!fire
1,"Summary:
1. It is _not_ about me.
 - Look at the other person's intention.

2. It is about me.
 - Give yourself empathy. Speak up.

3. People may attack you, criticise you, or ignore you. They can crumple you up with their words, spit you out, or even walk all over you. But remember, whatever they do or say, you will always keep your value."
1,"people have no responsible to make us happy. whatever we feel, is the risk of our own life. seriously, u can live well with good emotion if u can understand this."
2,easier said than done.
1,"I'm an extremely sensitive person and people's words and opinions about me affect me so much, although now i have learned to pretend to not care about them and give them power unlike a few years ago. I have gotten pretty good in my acting of not caring, it was really bad just about 2 years ago though.

But i am sensitive to an extent that i would see old people or little kids in distress or crying and i would feel like crying with them. I would also get angry fast, specially with people that are close to me.

I'm also a girl in my last Teenage year, the influence of teenage hormones should have decreased to a great extent by now but maybe thats just how i am as a person. I don't know. But I just want to be in control of my emotions on the outside regardless of how im feeling on the inside, thats what i want.

 Thanks for the ""its not about me"" concept Frederick. i realised i always made it about myself."
1,This is so beautiful.
1,"Its  just like the book of  Stephen Covey,  ""Seek first to understand  then to be understood."
1,"I guess I need a ted talk on how to be more patient, cuz I'm 16 minutes into this and haven't heard a single useful thing yet.

1,It’s like listening to the angel on my right shoulder tries to comfort me everytime people offend me personally.. flushed_face
1,"Is he simply saying that instead of assuming negative intentions, we should assume positive ones so that, we don't get irritated and instead just understand, but, there'll be scenarios where the other person may have negative intentions, and in this case, we would be able to protect ourselves 

I somewhat agree with what he said, but it's not bad to think about ""myself"", to not take things personally, we could also just ask what they want, instead of assuming their intentions in a positive way, although, there'll be people would lie to just to get what they want from you"

1,"Sorry, but if I walk away while you talk, or look a lot at my phone, or don't really hear, what you say, it IS personal! 
It is because there's something in our interaction or relationship that doesn't sit quite right with me.  If I am at ease with you and our communication or relation works, then I will listen attentively, respectfully and interested. 
So I find that the basis for this talk isn't all that great."

1,"Youtube: Our recommendations are personal to you
The videos they recommend: how not to take things personally"
1,This is a little tricky when dealing with emotional abuse and persons with personality disorders.
1,"hmmm i would disagree to a point. If someone starts txting in front of you while you are talking to them, it is logical to believe you are at least partially to blame, because you are in fact less important to them than the person on the other end of the phone, this is an objective truth. If what you were saying was more interesting to them than replying to their other friend, they wouldn't actually be txting. Someone who takes things personally is someone who is dependent on other peoples reactions to them for their self esteem and feeling of security. Each time they are ignored, and they take this personally, it is because the ignoring is an objective sign of their diminished importance to that person and this signals that they have little power in that persons life to change their behavior, that person has signaled that they feel no pressure to pay attention, and are also not interested either. thus making the offended person feel weak. The way you stop taking other peoples opinions personally is by placing little importance on their opinion of you, find other ways to build yourself up with confidence and self assurance, this way you will instead annoy others when they try to control you, instead of being offended when you cant control them."

1,"I remember watching a free concert by an esteemed professional BBC orchestra who put on the show for people that had never been to one before. It was a wonderful experience. On times, electrifying. When it finished, we all applauded. Then the conductor asked if we really enjoyed it, and we called out to him that we had. Then he told us that they'd found the experience dis- concerting, because we'd stayed quiet throughout the performance- which apparently experienced audiences do not do - that they were used to audience exuberance throughout their performances! Their relief at discovering that we thought it was actually fantastic and would definitely go to another was palpable - they laughed and played us a bit extra, and this time, we let them know how much we had enjoyed it and their faces, beamed at our beaming faces!
That was a lesson in how we can feel lesser, even when we are greater, due to nothing more than a lack of understanding/communication. We have to somehow at least give ourselves a break at least half the time - we're usually better than we think we are!"

1,The last handful of sentences were the best. Something no one wants to tell you because heaven forbid something constructive would be said. Online articles give you the opportunity to share something important and then when you do the public rakes you over the coals. I don’t blame Megan Markle for wanting to get out of the royal family! I thought nurses were b**ches to be around. I can’t remember working with a single nurse in over 30 years that could top that bunch. So yeah some things don’t need to be taken personally but when you can’t even put on a dress without some cheap shot flying your way it’s hard not to. And did we really need to know how much she paid for everything she ever wore? I would not have been able to be in her place and not take stuff personally after a while.

1,What an excellent speaker and human being. I will take this positive advice away with me! Lovely bloke thumbs_up
1,Now I get it. When trying to accomplish something on my own under all of the cameras then all I need to do is not take it personally when I don't get it right away. It is not my fault then being underserving of being there. That way I will not attract attention from others who might then take it personally for allowing me with a disability to be there with them too in the first place when they see how I am over reacting and being so hard on myself when I am not getting it right away when trying to learn something new just like everyone else there. Not that I would any longer take that accusation that I do not belong for good there personally any more too from now on. For example when I took that sort of thing personally when throwing caution to the wind in not withdrawing soon enough from that class to take it again when fo when the province I was living in at the time was no longer going to be full of forest fires and with a couple of large buildings on fire in the city I live in making it too hard for me to breathe there well enough to not take things too personally.

We are not, but we would like to think so because of the ego. I don't think we should kill the ego, but tame it. Maybe this is the real purpose of life."

1, I started crying! Finally I found something that speaks to my heart! Thank you red_heart
1,"I was bullied a lot as a kid and as a teenager. I thought I made it out pretty well into adulthood. Recently though, I've made some friends who are also my coworkers who say very annoying things that leave me fuming for a few hours even after work. I take the things they say to heart; I take the things they say very personally. I thought I would have thicker skin because I survived all that bullying but it seems all those emotions were internalized and are leaking out, sometimes in short explosive bursts. 

I hate it so much because I fear I'm alienating them by perceiving certain things as disrespect when they really don't mean to be malicious (and I KNOW what malice is.) I just don't like regression. I can stand up for myself now, and it's as if I'm making up for all the times I didn't stand up for myself in my younger years. But, these are the wrong people to always be ""standing up to."" I need to be more cool minded. 

I know what I must do but it is very hard to execute it. Also, people's expectations of you drives you to behave with them in a certain way. They now see me as the easily offended, angry person so now it feels like I'm stuck. Oh well. God knows best."

1,"I had an experience relatively recently when not taking things personally required the greatest self mastery. For 6 months,I'd been working on  a document in a highly specialized field. The man who reviewed what I'd written was undoubtedly  a world leader in this narrow subject of interest on which there are no text books or websites to obtain reference information. So, rather than receiving his review comments in written form, a meeting was organised where I got a verbal summary of his negative views (i.e. I'd comprehensively stuffed it up)in front of my work colleagues. In my 20 year career as an engineer, this had to be the most humiliating experience ever. I left the meeting feeling shell shocked. When looked at through the perspective of time, the entire task I'd been working on seemed absurd. Asking someone to reproduce results accurately in several months to reflect what others had made entire careers working on. I was essentially setup to fail. Admittedly I made mistakes in how I approached the task. I don't blame the reviewer for his negative comments - I'm certain he was correct in every instance."

1,speaking up is really good but never give yourself a lot of empathy it might make you depressed and self centered!
2,I like his strategy ' Its not about me'

1,"I usually don't take things personal, but there is one thing does kind of bother me and maybe someone can explain.  I'm not necessarily looking for attention; it's just more of an observation.  So I will comment on YouTube or post something on Facebook groups and will never receive more than 8 likes on average and have never exceeded 38 likes on any one given post.  I've made funny, witty, both long and short comments, you name it.  I've even been the first to comment on many occasions to both Facebook group posts and YouTube videos, receive somewhere between 17-23 likes and then a week or month later, someone will post the exact same comment, word for word , and receive 1k + likes.  And when the tables turn and I do the same (copy a comment/post word for word) I get maybe 1-3 likes.  I've even looked at some of the individuals channels (the ones getting 1k+ likes) and they don't have many subscribers or followers (like  5 to 25 subscribers).    I don't get it?"
1,Thanks a lot for this valuable episode. i learnt one things that we shoudn't take everything personally. from today i will try to dont take all the things personally Inshallah.

1,"This lesson, and perspective, on emotional intelligence (EQ) is priceless. The double-sided coin strategy is simple and easy to follow. My ego gets in my way often, and I take things personally. I think we all do. We'd be much happier and at peace if we could really embrace this."
1,"Even though we have a broad communication mechanism we still have difficulty speaking up what we are feeling at the right moment. There are still inside of ourselves insecurities to tell what we are and what we are feeling. Perhaps, because we are forced to think we are not good enough. However, I'm confident in saying that you are good enough and you have the power to speak up what is going on in yourselves' thoughts, what word we have misunderstood, and so on. Not taking personally is a lack of self-confidence and communication skills and we still struggling with these issues."

1,"Great talk! A lot of this touches on some of the things I had to face during CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) and definitely those techniques, those thought patterns resonate with me greatly. We are all in a constant battle against ourselves, yet we add another opponent sometimes without realising - the other person. But as you say, if you can step out from that apply one or both of those techniques, chances are that it was just a misunderstanding either by the other person, or by you.

Thank you for your time @Frederik Imbo"

Michael Jordan: “thats all i needed, so it became personal with me”"
1,red_heartred_heartred_heartred_heartred_heartred_heart
1,"Question: how do you practice this (like you did being a referee) when you can't psyche yourself up before the proverbial game? I have a few meetings at work where I can psyche myself up, but in my personal life and general work life ""attacks"" come out of left field"" and generally act as daggers straight to the heart.

Scenario: the repeated situation that hurts the most is my Motger-in-laws comments since my daughter was born 2.5 years ago (& my husband's default to agree with her because ""he is not all knowing"" & apparently his mother is, and thus my family's p.o.v. and my own research is dung--I should be strung up and beaten for offering an infant organic store-bought baby food or using Water Wipes instead of a full on bum bath with every diaper... the list goes on)

In terms of your video, I am trying to prepare myself for future encounters (& the birth of my next child which gives me anxiety attacks for the reasons above)

1. It's not about you. It's about them... she does have an unresolved chronic anxiety problem. In her culture and family, giving advice sounds a lot more like criticism and demands (especially when you respectfully decline that advice and screaming matches ensue for the next several conversations until you comply)... this is reason #2 my husband takes her side--not worth what she puts people through when they disagree with her. (Hmmm, so maybe I should turn into a screaming banshee to get my way? Nope, I don't like yelling and in instances when I do, my husband's not a fan, either.)

2. It is about me. ABSOLUTELY I was hundred_points percent insecure about being a first time mom. My husband always tells me to have more confidence,  but then undermines that statement by cow towing to the all-knowing matriarch. I'm prepared to stand my ground, give myself empathy, even consider the advice part of the screaming outbursts of anxiety (I greatly respect her and much of her advice, I just have deep scars from the wounds inflicted when I was at my most vulnerable).

3. This one's hard, but I think it might be key. I need to remember that even if the people closest to me--truly, my whole support system locally--treat me like dirt, my value hasn't changed. I hope that this will be the key to not struggling deeply with suicidal thoughts post partum because I don't think my toddler could receive my best care if I hit that stage again.

Oh, and I do speak up, but it has become one of the worst recurring fights of my marriage. I never feel heard, or understood when it comes to his mom & I get that it's hard for him. Lately I have felt that if my confidence level goes up and he repeats behavior from the first time around, I don't know if our marriage will recover from that. If I see my value and the people around me keep crumbling, spitting, stepping, discarding... I'm not sure how that will work.

Potential answer: I do try to psyche myself up before seeing them. I try to prepare the house and clothes for my daughter in a way that is above reproach and then still steel myself for the ""attacks"" but I have found that it has made me a bitter cynic, and, as I mentioned briefly, these people are the closest people to me physically and emotionally right now. This also impacts the way my husband sees me and he'll say things like ""maybe we need to keep you away from them while you work on your heart"" (another trigger) ...I care about them which is why it hurts worse when ""attacks"" come--I just want to feel approval, not like everything would be better for everyone without me."

1,With the power of neural networks I'd really love to visualize the distribution of negative and positive thoughts.  Fun that would be. Scientific spirituality.
1,"it's not as simple as that. when a person is tailgating you and honking you can't surely know that they are in a hurry, they might just be a mean person who is shallow and can never see past themselves. Where i come from, most people will expect good things for them but never show consideration when its about others. Even my own relatives, theyd be mad at somebody if someone was in front of them driving slowly, while id only be annoyed if that person is banging loud music and purposefully driving slow. these are the kinda people who are always looking for trouble so that they can feel good by putting other people down. 
it's not about me is a good strategy but only when both the people are trying. majorly in life though, the other people are just being entitled and even will go to any extent just to prove themselves right. they'd even lie right through their teeth just to prove their own point which wouldn't even be meaningful and just be a waste of time and energy.
i wanna know how to deal with those kinds people. the ones who really test your patience and make you lose faith in humanity as a whole.
im surrounded by them. i wish well for them and always try to be polite because i know they dont know maybe that their character is mean and selfish,  but all i get in return is rudeness and then i cant help but lose my cool too. the toxicity always ruins my days."

1,"honestly.. I found this guy annoying, took it personaly and left.. and I bet we're all cool with it :)"
2,"True, its pride. Like what Mother Teresa said, if you are humble - being criticized or applauded to doesnt change your peace. Being humble is being in tune with the truth."
1,"You can filter everything that happens in your day as “that is a them problem”. If you realize the problem you are having is stemming from you, then you can become more mindful and try to problem solve and figure out why you have that problem. If you have a hard time doing it yourself, therapy is a great way to help you do this!"
1,"It's all about the feelings that surround rejection, if someone doesn't listen to us, or offends us we experience feeling of rejection, but those that do the most rejecting (ie ignoring offending) take rejection the worst, the idea is to treat reject in a positive way, because it tells us one of two things we need to make adjustments to ourselves or something or someone is wrong for us...."

2,What a great public speaker!
1,"Thank you smiling_face. Few people, who cared for me  came up to me to say it alright! Don't take it personally. But noo!!, My ego said they are just trying to manipulate you. 
I've been trying to not get irritated at every little things that happen around me. But, it's too difficult for me. I hurt people who irritate me with worst words that I know of. Before I realise what's happening it'll be too late and I'll end up feeling bad about it. I've just said to myself that I didn't start itgrinning_face_with_sweat.
Instead of training myself to not take everything personal. I've been distancing myself from those who I've labelled as difficult people. 
It cost me alot. I ended up losing people who genuinely cared for me. 
I'm grateful for this video. red_heart"

1,"I really liked the last part. I knew about the majority of the talk. But I sometimes forget that I'm not the center of the universe. And my ego slowly and secretly grows bigger and bigger. Until, I'm mad most of the time and don't know why people are turning away from me. Your ego is important, but you have to always keep it on a leash.

Another saying that can fit is: Check yourself, before you wreck yourself."

1,This really hit hard. Harder than other Ted Talks. I assumed he would say 'its not about me' part but that 'its about you part' is where that got me. Damn bro thanks
2,"50.000 thoughts a day, and 10.000 of them only are positive,,, WOW"
1,"This is the most inspirational ted video that I’ve watched so far. I feel like he’s talking about me as I’m usually affected by others’ negative opinions, criticism. That make me feel super insecure about myself and even now when recalling them, sometimes I still get hurt. So I keep watching the video repeatedly whenever I’m in bad mood. Please don’t let other’s opinion about you lose your confidence and dignityred_heart"

1,Woah... that's the reason why I am a cashier at a ghetto family dollar store. To learn how to not take things personally.  His talk was truly amazing
1,This talk is very superficial. Simply telling people to let go of their ego or to think of positive things is very cheap advice.
1,"That last bit with that 20 euro's came in like a train! If you just keep that in mind, your negative thougths, the critisism and putting down of you by others all disapear, even on the moment that it happens. If that happens and you think of that 20 euros... you may even begin to smile ;)"
1,"Bravo! Good talk! But Frederik talks a bit lowly, no offense."
1,thought that was harry for a second

1,"Many times I’ve been thinking, when for instance a driver honks at you or yells at you for doing X or Y, and you want to react strongly (insult, shout, come to hands), they’re not yelling at YOU.
They’re yelling at the RANDOM person that was in this very place at this very moment. They’re yelling at a situation.
They would have yelled at ANYONE that would have been in your place.

When you see some driver honk or yell at somebody ELSE, do you still want to insult, shout, come to hands? No? And yet, it’s the EXACT same situation.

P.S.: imagine you suddenly realize that this driver you want to punch is somebody you like very much (friend, cousin, aunt, uncle). How would you then react? Calm down and have a friendly chat with them, if not hug them? Or still want to punch them?"

1,"Core message at .
In general I feel like I am very open with my feelings (unless it is towards a woman then I am just awkward LOL). I voice my opinion, I voice my feelings, and I can say it openly, both when put on the spot and when not put on the spot. What the problem, I think, is that in many cases that sounds like _complaining_ and _blaming_ . I am very *bad* at saying these things without being hurtful in some sense. I want to avoid attacking others, but it almost always happens. I don't know how to do it and I think this is biggest problem.
Apart from that, yes I feel hurt a lot as well. It's probably rooted in childhood, no idea where exactly though. I have come to the conclusion that to some extent I probably enjoy getting frustrated so that I have something to vent about? Not sure if it's true, but it would be an explanation for why I'd stay in the same work place or situation for so long if I know that it's bad for me. I'm scared of not being able to find something new, I guess....?! I'm scared of not being good enough. Scared of wasting time although I'm wasting time."

1,This guy sucks so bad it’s very hard to listen to the positive message. There’s a negative thought for you. He should hire someone to speak for him.
1,"Years ago when I was a young teen I was coming home a bit late from somewhere and getting the local bus, a school friend’s father was a bus driver and he happened to be driving the bus I needed, we exchanged pleasantries etc. but he soon took the conversation to somewhere else and made a vulgar proposition, I was young and inexperienced with life in general so I was inwardly very shocked at what he was suggesting, quietly hoping, wishing the journey would end and I could get off the bus safely at my stop. Thankfully the time came when I could get off the bus and get away from him but the conversation had inwardly shaken me up. When I reached home a dear family friend had come to visit but my greeting was not very warm (my mind was still dealing with all the horrible suggestions that bus driver was making). I registered an instant look of hurt on my dear friend’s face and deeply regretted coming across so cold and distant. (I don’t know how I managed to salvage my evening with her) but I hope to recall this experience as a valuable lesson…people can behave in a negative manner towards me but there could be a real reason or excuse for why they are. So do NOT take it personally!"

1,"Good speech. Presented in a way I'm not used to, it kept my interest.
I didn't really realise it but now you've exposed it I see I've been using that strategy to cope with life for some years now and it really works!
I see myself as very self-critical and flipping my view to understanding that other people also have agendas in life calms me down when I feel unappreciated, mocked or criticised by others.
Yes, there are things I can change about me, my approaches, the way I handle a situation, but by empathising with another's responses I can learn to improve my own actions.
I'm a father to an autistic child and I am learning every day how to deal with his responses. It's a challenge and it helps me to cope with interactions with other people in my life as well.
Thankyou for laying out the strategy - it really does help."
2,You are great! I enjoyed listening to you.
1,I think `wanting to be right` is not the same thing as taking things personally and is overemphasized here. Its only certain personality types whose egos have that goal of being right -- other people have different ego priorities. Some of the other things you talked about like recognition and being taken into account by others are probably more universal.

This video really helped me realize that I wasn’t showing myself empathy for the smallest mistakes. Thank you smiling_face"

2,"This is such an important video, great talk, great reminder, so thank you Frederik!"
1,"My own rules which helped me a lot was:
A) if someone is shouting at you: try to replace that person with a person which you highly admire and ask whether he would behave like that? For example can you imagine Barack Obama driving after you and flashing the lights? I can’t. Would he shout at the referee? Even if the referee had failed very badly he would rather take him aside and give very valuable tips. People are attacking because of their own emotional instability, not because you made a mistake. Everyone does. And always be ‘Barack Obama’ yourself 
B) If you have some insecurities and people mention it, you would take it personally only if you are judging yourself. Exactly as the author said, you would not be offended if someone calls you an orange if you don’t believe you are an orange or you are Proud being an orange. If there are things you believe you are and you are not proud, be very clear to yourself and make a plan how you will fix it. Accept your current state and be proud about your progress. You will learn so much more on the way. 

Good luck to everyone on your journeys face_blowing_a_kiss"

But my greatest surprise was my investment of $ 3,000 came out with $ 6,580 in 10 days trading ..... You just have to be patient with them till your trades are completed ..... To be honest I didn't just  recovered all my previous losses .. I made much more than my past expenses .. actually she charges 15% which won't affect you in any way since her trading efficiency comes in multiples of investment ...

1,"'we' is all very well - and is a kindly, though ultimately deluded, way of not making it about 'me'. The other person doesn't have a life-changing message just come in. The missing part of this approach is firstly to be honest: they are not that invested, or interested in me or my psychological well-being. But we should all be ok with that and just have enough self-worth to be OK."

1,this speech's amazing .. thank you uncle !!
1,"I agree you should control yourself and not get angry or react in a way that ruins your day, but you definitely need to cut these toxic people out of your life. If somebody abandons agreements with you disrespectfully or dismisses them as if it doesn't matter, instead of trying to understand them and their motives while they clearly don't make any effort from their side to match that because they were never interested in the first place just cut them out of your life fast and forever. This is more efficient then having to face this situation again and again and trying to explain it to yourself through the prism of reshaping your personality. Narcissists are narcissists. You can't change them. If person's own agenda and own feelings are all that matters after having agreed with somebody else than this person doesn't deserve to be in that contract with you. Contracts and agreements are about both parties and they ONLY work if there is trust. And trust is only acquired if both parties feel respected and reciprocate. End of story."

1,"You are much appreciated for sharing one of life’s vital lessons. The knowledge gained from your words will have its greatest value when one is able to use wisdom to regularly apply it in their lives. 

There’s a saying which helps me to remain centered in not taking things personally a majority of the time: Misery loves company.

People who are emotionally and mentally weak easily become jealous/envious of people who are stronger than they are in those areas as well as many other areas.

When people feel a need to say or do things ‘to’ you, whether they are conscious or not of what their actions will cause, their ego’s goal is to bring you down to the level of pain and suffering it’s experiencing at that point in time. It cannot handle being around people who have it together and are happy most of the time.

This is when I shift my focus onto the saying ‘misery loves company’. NEVER take it personally. Instead, see the sufferer as the one who is taking something about you so personally that they would go to great lengths to bring you down in order to prop themselves up.

When we can master this, then an even more challenging lesson to master is catching one’s own ego in the act of being the sufferer seeking out company to share in it’s own misery. It must be put in its place. Once we master this lesson, we will no longer play the victim of the ego and, instead, become the victor of our true self. Then, nothing can phase us.

We are what we think; therefore, think wisely."

I try to protect myself from mental pain by comforting myself, I play mind tricks, but it doesn't really seem to ease my pain. I now have severe high blood pressure problems in my early 20s (along with other health problems), and I feel I'm standing at the edge.

1,He was a great speaker...... but had a totally dead audience.   Good  message and something to think about because we all are super sensitive and insecure.  Ego is something that trips all of us up constantly and we see everything through this very paranoid filter that destroys us all through the day.  We lay in bed at night dwelling on the things that deflated our wounded self esteem.  Bottom line:  ITS NOT ALWAYS ABOUT ME !  live with it.

1,How does he know how many thoughts people think and how many of them are positive/negative?
2,Oh wow! You should be a psychologist! excellent presentation by the way! I like it.
1,Sometimes intentions are to harm you but this is primarily about the other person.  This is true and useful because adults need to be in charge of their health and well-being without the belief that we can change others without their permission and/or agreement.  We can only influence change.  Keep in mind we are social beings and naturally rely on support and consideration.  The healthy choice is to surround yourself with compassionate and empathetic humans.  Keep in mind also that competition increases the chance of attack and can result in wins and losses.  The truth is that human value is outside of competition.
1,The ego takes everything seriously.

In order to not create waves in a professional environment; one continues to bottle up and not listen to their gut(ego) only one day explode from bullies and abusers that take advantage of the hard earners and reward the lazy egomaniac complainers. Little bitches that are seen as Golden boys, continued to be protected by nice people ignoring their ego.

1,"Brilliant. Wise.
All so true.
I can see that it is not about me, but I take it further, finding out precisely what is it.
I try to figure out the latent origin in them.
People exhibit behaviour out of inner state of self, compounded to a feeling, emerging another feeling.
I try to work out backwards , to recognize the inner state of self.
Example
If someone is angry at you, it could be the product of his inner self state of frustration compounded to immediate feeling of jealousy."

Personally I decided for myself do not take the things personally because it’s waste of time, energy and mood; with all this leaving a choice for myself to self-reflect or not. Unexpectedly, I realized that I have been adhering these tactics for a long time, that’s why this video is kind of reminder that I always keep value no matter what and no matter they say."

1,This is soo amazing. By far this would be the best ted talk for me
1,"A very effective talk, given the examples he brought. When I was a 5 year-old boy, my dad was constantly saying ""hey, do not try to be yourself, be different, if you keep doing that, you will go nowhere in this society"". In response, I resisted for a fair period of my life period, but eventually I gave up and learned this lesson. When I became a little older, I saw some children throwing stones at a kitten, I resisted and tried to save it, but they beat me up. I came back, hurting too much physically and emotionally, but my mom said ""you can not change everything, so don't always give it a try to everything"" and I learned that. However, a part of me resisted all my life to these ridiculous pieces of advice that were common in their daily dialogues of our own people. It has passed so many years since then. Now, I look the people in my generation that are constantly trying to appease others by behaving in a way that is contrary to their feelings and their self-satisfaction, because they are trying to hide their own feelings and be somebody else that the society likes. These people will keep following the mistakes of the society even though they are certainly sure that is a mistake. For instance, when a family can not afford to make ends meet in our ever-lasing economic crisis, they decide to add one more mouth to their home because the majority of people behave the same way and decide to have a baby even though they are more than sure that they are not able to support him/her. This results to a lot of insecure child abandoned by their parents. When somebody robs an old citizen in the range of my mom's age, threatening him/her to give all his/her belongings on the street, the youth in my generation will not help as they have already learned that ""they can not change everything"", especially such a challenging situation, ""so, don't even think of giving it a try to everything"", and walk way as it is not your problem."
2,Nice one clapping_handsclapping_handsclapping_hands
1," A loved one walking away while you are trying to tell them something that is important to you...
Hmmmmm Sure it has part to do with ego (it's not always about being right though!), but also I think it is fair to be disappointed in them! TV at that point surely is less important than having the chance to talk over a situation together?... It's true as a person you always keep value if you believe in yourself but... Is it not fair to hope and expectation, that your partner will let you talk through your fears, hopes frustrations? Not because they are always aligned, but because they are important to you? And therefore also important markers as a partnership, with a view to both understanding each other with open communication and respect?

At the end of the day we are all alive for the first time - so we make mistakes!
(I say this with humour since I don't believe in any other lifetime, you can if you want I don't need you theories)

But sometimes I think, there is a very good reason to take an action personally!

1,"Points of your presentation are right on.  But certain moments in life require us NOT to be insipid bullet proof aloof persons out to artificially support our personal positive outlook goals.  If, like you said, you are blocking traffic or moving slower than everyone else then you are being selfish for not allowing them to pass, especially if after a period of time you've ignored the signals from those around you that you are irritating them.  This is common respect for the feelings of others, and if I am in back of you and I notice that there is a long line of cars that YOU are holding up, then it IS about US and not you, and you should move the heck out of the way or speed up.  God help us if the world adopts these feel good seminars.  I don't want to feel so good that I am in denial about the world and my surroundings.  I understand the need to control one's ego, but I'm not sure it's the right thing to not make it about ""ME"" and make it about ""WE"" all the time.  By building my confidence, I am not threatened by anything or anyone, and understand that everyone else could be confident in the attributes and great spirit that God gave them.  I am then open to love by others.  We are individuals living in a very corrupt world.  I think you better have an ego to survive and effect positive change, or else you'll remain willfully, dangerously silent, as the never-sleeping bad guys encroach to tear the world down.  When I honk, you have placed yourself in front of common sense needs and sensibilities of generally accepted protocols of consideration for other drivers.  Please pull over for the rest of us!  Our time is precious."

I stay calm and collected because then hopefully they realize how ridiculous they're acting and maybe it will embarass them enough to change their behavior in the future and even if they don't,  it's only a reflection of who they are as a person. It's hard for me to get offended for this reason. Talking poorly about others is just a reflection of who you are."
1,Thank you Frederik for the wonderful presentation. I wish I was one of your audiences at that time of your presentation. I was really drawn to the way you present and your personality. Cheers x

1,"Interesting.  On my way to an appointment,  an older lady was both tail gaiting and flashing lights at me even though I was driving at the posted speed limit.
Her erratic  behavior caused me to wait for her to pass before changing lanes for my own safety.   Ironically I moved a few lanes over to reach an exit and when I Iooked in her direction she was going about the same speed, not faster.  A lesson in doing the right thing (driving correctly) no matter what another driver does.   Allow others to push you around and they shrink back, is this where the phrase shrinking violets comes from?"

1,"""Ego is the enemy"" by Ryan holiday is a good read for concepts such as these.
Really helpful tidbits in life. Great concept by the way, literally referees are always spat on in the face and still don't flip out they just do their jobs, there are one of the few set of people who don't take things personally.
The world would be a better place if leaders or politicians don't take things personally.

                    Kudos to a really educative Ted."
1,"And sometimes there's truth in what people say but it is highly exaggerated, so it's a mix of the two methods. For example, let's imagine a person hasn't slept at all. This person is grumpy. If you talk a bit too much and the person  shouts "" just shut up we're all sick of hearing you talk"", there may be truth in it but it's highly exaggerated because his own emotions emphasize it.

Don't forget the context!

Oh and something else. Let's imagine you're an insecure introvert. If people keep telling you ""you don't talk enough"", you're gonna take it personally and think it's in your nature. You won't change. But if you don't talk enough that's because you're insecure! NOT because you're an introvert. A confident introvert is social and loves talking, just not the same way as an extrovert.

That's just an example to show you that most of the time, we don't understand ourselves or the other person enough. We need to be more empathetic towards the other and us. We should analyze the situation.

Just what I wanted to say :) love you all"
1,You are an HSP
2,The ending was brilliant
1,"Few other ways:
1. ""That's like, your opinion, man. You can't know what's actually in my head.""
2. ""Hey, the constitution guarantees you the right to freedom of speech, and I won't take that from you. But I too have freedom of speech and opinion. And I think differently about this.""
3. ""I'm not perfect, nobody is, so I think this shortcoming in me, is quite tolerable at the moment, can we move to the next topic?""
Also, everybody should be taught a little bit of psychology in school. Especially about how insecure people talk, think and react."

2,That was the most profound analogy for my spirit. Thank you ever so muchtwo_hearts
1,"I feel a little uncomfortable with the excessive negative emotion and feelings Frederik unveiled about himself in this talk, but then I realize he was expressing himself in a very sincere way and decided not to be affected by other people’s criticism — that is the ego or personal value he was keeping talking about. And I think he did it in not taking things personally himself! Great speaker~
What also inspired me in this talk, apart from not taking things personally as an individual, people also need to reflect on their ways of judging others and make more respect for the world. Keep a balance in expressing oneself and understanding others~ Good luck on our journey in living a happier life!"

1,"For any person  that is struggling with ""taking things personally"", by understanding what this guy is saying, it  can be a life changer.  
This is an excellent presentation. If I could add one thing it would be that  before taking things personally, first  remind your self that you don't know what the other person's mental fitness is at this moment and what they have been through. 
Then go to ""it is not about me""  (most people are care about their own needs and  not the other's and put themselves first.), then go to maybe it is about me. 
Give each three parts equal weight/value."

1,"There are two kinds of people you will meet in your life time: Good and Bad people.
Good people are easier to relate to; they inherently are good natured and will not intentionally harm or antagonize you in bad faith, at least not always.
On the other hand, bad people are angry; negative, fault finding, blame mongering revengeful ppl, all out to put down anyone who ""is the cause of their angst"". How do you ""keep your value""  before such ppl?  Or rather; don't you sometimes lose that value if, in trying to keep it, you  let them ""swallow/spit you,   kick you, mud you and what-have-you"".

But what is the point of being a kind, empathetic and perspective taking person,  if whatever I do  does not and should not have any bearing or effect on anyone else's feelings or life experience? I feel like we take things personally because when we interact with others,  many times it is  about the other person.  Sometimes yes and sometimes no. And when someone has a problem with me, I ought to take it personally and take a look at it. It's not always about me, but sometimes it is. Unless we are talking about a small child having a tantrum. There's a difference between being paranoid about others' reactions and being cognizant that our behaviors actually do have a great impact on others and vice versa"

1,"I tried “do you want to be right or happy” in my abusive relationship :( I kept thinking I’m too sensitive and emotional. It worked a bit though because I know someone else yelling at me and belittling and disrespecting me isn’t about ME. Yes, it’s happening to me, but it’s not my fault. I can recognize and realize he’s suffering with mental issues, but the yelling from a grown man is so damaging :( I want to care about his needs but he’s hurting me so much I can only take it personally. He says he’s sorry, he’s trying, I need to forgive or I can’t love. I never forgive anything he says. But I’ve been following “do you want to be right or happy?” I’ve been letting lots go. But I never forgive because he wants me to be nice and like nothing happened the day after he belittles me. Or that same day I should be over it because he said sorry. :("
1,"Well, it would make your friend happy if you listen and give advice while something is wrong with him/her, instead of ignoring him/her. That's what a friend is for. That person/close friend has the right to feel upset if I purposefully don't give them the support they might need in that moment because I want to watch a video or something that could have waited. So there exists a lot of scenarios where EGO is not the case and I would have to disagree with this perfect mentality."
1,I want to cut them in my life if they keep putting me in a tough situation and I am sick of putting up with their bulls. I believe it’s better for my health not to be with particular people.

As an empath i put myself in other's shoes as often as blinking, It's first nature for me. 
So when someone cuts me off in traffic, I shrug it off. Yea, I may feel annoyed from being cut off in traffic because I'm thinking that could have been an accident! 
The annoyance lasts for a few moments then it gets shrugged off and I then feel grateful that it wasn't an accident n noone got hurt. My demeanor is pretty laid back, if a friend turns down an invite it may feel uncomfortable for a moment but then my mind starts thinking, hey sometimes I don't want to hang out with my peeps and just want to keep it in and enjoy my alone time... no harm no foul. 
 It takes great injustices to get me fired up.

*STRATEGY*
Consider their perspectives, consider their intentions.
It’s not about me huh..? 
Me to we! Oki

You have no clue what they are laughing at. You think they’re laughing at your new shoes, for  all you know eg they could be laughing at a funny looking insect on the floor! 
Look at it from their perspective.

Again.
It’s not about me.
_they just want to be right, to win_

 

*STRATEGY 2! If strategy 1 does not work.*

Some really do hurt. Some really do question so it’s hard to think about from their perspective!
“I was driving too slowly..it was my fault that he was honking his horn”
Answer: ITS NOW ABOUT YOU!

HAHA I LOVE THIS EXAMPLE
Nothing in you believes that you are an orange!
Compared to
“You are selfish!”
Feeling hurt from this is mostly rooted from childhood :(
A raw nerve was hit? Give yourself...some empathy. Speak up about your vulnerabilities. 

Homework: take things personally, to put these into practice!

HE JUST
BAHAHA.
HE JUST ATE MONEY.
AND SPAT IT.
THATS 20 EUROS MAN-


Q: do you still want that 20 euros?
I- well y e a. That’s like 20 bucks! Can buy myself a whole subway! 2 of em!

""People may attack you, criticise you, or ignore you. They can crumple you up with their words, spit you out, or even walk all over you, but remember, whatever they do or say, you will always keep your value.""


Keep your head high! Your value will never, ever change! No matter what they do to you!

*SUMMARY.*

Strategy 1: it’s not about you! 
Me to We! Think of their intentions. It takes training to find them as positive intentions. You have n o idea what they are laughing about. Besides..who told you they were laughing at your shoes! That’s right. It’s an accumulation of one own negative thought of the other 39,999,999.

Strategy 2: ouch..:( 
“am I really that selfish?” 
When strategy 1 doesn’t work, it’s our resort to really think about the truth of it. 
Roots: childhood..? 
In this case is about you! Don’t beat yourself up. This has truly hurt you! An actual insecurity from again deeper roots! How could you control that. Here..open up. Be vulnerable. Tell them what you feel. They’ll most likely understand you. Tell them, without blaming them, how you truly felt.

Bad notes I know to another eye, but these will really help me reinforce to not take it personally. 

Thank you Frederick. I truly laughed and felt something indescribable <3"
1,"It’s difficult to watch something that may address parts of who I am!  I learned the phrase “what you think of me is none of my business “  a long while back, while in a treatment center 
For anxiety & depression & grew up the oldest in an alcoholic home. I was used to taking care of everything &!I don’t remember anything but criticism and never “good job”  or a pat on the back so grew up never feeling good enough or Like I fit in , but I am outgoing & appear confident & strong and it’s difficult for me to be vulnerable so I get no empathy or compassion when I am. That saying helped me tremendously, but because I changed, I have lost a lot of family & friends in the process!  When I try to use what I learned to help someone, I think they take it as criticism (and I think I know everything) but because of my childhood, it’s very hard to sit by & not do something, which is what I learned to do as a child .  I’m   co-dependent!  I’m working on it:-))
When you’re always being criticized because people’s perception of what you say or do is wrong , when do you stop defending yourself.  Eventually when I speak up & engage them in a verbal confrontation because I’ve had enough , that’s when they can’t deal with it and leave!  Everyone is passive aggressive & never get to the point they are trying to make or give an example, just walk out!  EGO’s or our false selves are very pretty sensitive & we may get ours under better control but if the other person hasn’t , there’s no sense even having a discussion!

Book is, “Don’t sweat the small stuff, and it’s all small stuff”

No.12- Let others be “right” most of the time.

One of the most important questions you can ever ask yourself is, ""Do I want to be 'right' - or do I want to be happy?"" Many times, the two are mutually exclusive!
Being right, defending our positions, takes an enormous amount of mental energy and often alienates us from the people in our lives....continues"
1,Astonishing the fact that our brain generates around 50.000 thoughts per day and only 20% of these are positive. It requires a real effect and discipline to train yourself to not to take things personally.

If someone watches on their screen during your presentation it might mean they have short attention span or something important happened. But most likely it means the presentation is dull and YOU are the one responsible for making it dull. There's no contradiction between happiness and being right. If i shield myself from ""taking it personally"", i limit my ways of improvement. In fact, when you decline self criticism like that by switching to ""we"" mentality Frederik talks about here, it IS a way of staying happy because you are always right. Or maybe this presentation fails to deliver a message for me."

Because the ones that can be avoided, can be avoided but what about those that make you feel like your self respect is seriously being tested and if you don't actually react to that sort of slander, it means that you don't have any dignity? I'm not referring to ego or pride or vanity. I'm asking about situations where someone makes a hurtful comment about something that's definitely personal. Example, A race or religion or a community.What should we do during such situations? Amazing speech btw. Those audience members don't understand how lucky they are."

1,"It isn't as, ""simple as that."" Some of us fight the fights to stop people abusing us AND others. It's called societal correction; also called cultural conditioning, or even just plain teaching, those who should have already learned appropriate behaviour, that they should not continue to act in those ways.  

Blaming ego and choosing to not correct abusive behavior is cowardly and selfish.  Those who only care about themselves can use this strategy. Those who choose to help society need to not just deflect abuse, but to correct others. 

A, ""better world,"" is not made by ignoring problems."

Here is my notes...


#  Why do we takes things personally ?
#  When somebody says something or does then why do we feel hurt, neglected, offended, betrayed by the other one...he/she is responsible for this for what I am feeling? 
• Whose says that which part of us speaking?  - our EGO .
• our ego wants consideration, wants to always right.
#  Do you want to be right ?
• When our ego takes over on us, we feel exhausted, drained because we are fighting or struggle with world all day.
#  Do you want to be right/ do you want to be happy ?
#  Strategies 
1. It's not about me...bcz my brain is already convinced that it's about me, my or mine....
So, convert this ME to WE....look at the other person's intentions.
• our brain produces 50,000 thoughts in a day & only 10,000 are positive. 
• to see positive intentions of other one required a lot of discipline & training. 

2. If 'it's not about me' doesn't work then use 'it's about me' & then you need to give yourself some EMPATHY.  And SPEAK UP & just tell the other one what's going on by opening up, by being vulnerable, by telling what you feel without blaming the other one you increase the chance of other one will understand you.
• people may attack you, criticize you or ignore you, they can crumple with their words speak you or even vocal of you...but remember whatever they do or say they will always keep your value.
• Your value doesn't decrease because of someone's inability to see your worth."

1,"Watching the speaker not just inspired me to be a better person and to not take things personally, but also he motivated me to be good in communicating and speaking too. I am an introvert and afraid to speak everytime, but with how he talks I idolized how he speak and talk. Thank you so much! The 18 minutes was worth it. I hope you could see my message and also help me too. Have a great day! Well, I guess TED talks really changed me as a better person in all aspects of my life. I hope they will go to the Philippines and go to different universities and schools to teach not just students, but also people who are interested to learn and listen. I appreciate everything they taught me and now I am living a happy life day by day, one step at a time."

1,"This is great, he is addressing something that we have all truly need to start practicing. You wouldn't believe how much ego truly does get in the way of being able to have empathy for oneself, and others. Practice, practice, practice is the key.
When catching yourself talking bad to yourself, quickly replace it with good thoughts, things that are true about you.
All too often do we allow ourselves to believe things that are not true, about oneself. We are our own worst critics, and really haven't been good friends to our own selves as well.
It is about time someone addressed how to learn, and practice to become One's best friend! 
Wonderful presentation!

1,Why can't you be both happy and right?
1,"This is what he wants from everyone around him: fair play, respect and positivity. So off the pitch this is what he also expects from others, great standards. Only difference is, people are allowed to act as they will off the pitch without the seen repercussion. where as when he is on he unfortunately holds power that the players understand and abide by, which would actually get them banned if they were to overstep their bounds, very different unfortunately. I want to set everyone to that standard, and I will, even myself. Now the only thing is conveying to others to respect that boundary in a way that will allow them to understand, sounds like a mutual agreement is in order. Any other ideas for people who feel they want to break boundaries?

I just found that keeping your boundary is the difference between insanity and sanity. keep your boundary above all else, find what your boundaries are and tell people they are not allowed to cross it"

How not to take things personally? | Frederik Imbo | TEDxMechelen

Examples:
I take it personally when theres someone drivng behind me honking and flashing their light to make me go faster. 
While I talk about something thats important to me people go on the phone - I take it personally.
Someone does something and we feel hurt and we believe its there fault. 
It drains so much energy. If I didnt took so uch stuff personali I wouls be free.
The big question is, do you want to be right or do you want to be happy?

1. Its not about me 
People dont want to try to offend you and even if why should you care 
Try to understand of the Intention of the other one, why are they doing what they are doing.
Like child laying on the ground screaming ""I hate you"" ... is it about you? No! Its about what he wants and needs. Maybe some difficulties in the past that leads him to that behavior.
Look at the others persons intention - its not about me. 
Someone driving pushing you - maybe he is in a hurry. 

The big parts of our thoughts over the da are bad. We start to project our selves to be the reason why people are laughing ""my hair must be off"" then in reality they are talking about a funny clip. It takes practice and discipline to reroute your thinking.

People on the otherhand will shout on you, not because of you, but cuz they WANT TO BE RIGHT.
If I say to you, you are an Orange, would you believe me? No, cuz nothing in you believes you are an orange.

2. It is about me - Give yourself empathy and SPEAK UP
Just tell them whats going on inside you
""Hey im in the middle of story here, and you just went to switch of the TV. It feels that you dont care. Its nots that respectful.""
Open up, be vulnerable, telling how you feel with out hurting or blaming  the other one 
The chance will be higher that the other one will understand you 

If we would all practice this, it would make the world alot better. 
Remember what other people say about you, you will keep your value. You define yourself and are not defined by your surroundings."
2,"Damn, that was a strong ending! Top notch!"
1,I take everything personally!i hope I can change it
1,I enjoyed this talk a lot..so much to learn...very wise words...thank u so much Frederick..n thank u tedtalks
1,That was beautiful about always keeping your value.
1,Heads or Tales & Me to We. Brilliantly simple. Simply complex. Great Speech.
1,Just remember that most of the time the other person isn’t intentionally trying to hurt you remember that communication is key and ask them why they did what they did instead of jumping to conclusions words have more of an effect than you think so think next time before you speak and/or do something that may hurt someone else
1,I think it's the universe's magic that YouTube recommended me this video when I needed this the most!
1,I don't take things personally from the people I don't personally know.
1,"Because it is such a reliable situation, this could've easily been an 8 min talk without loosing any of its impact, tbh I found it a bit tough to get through because 1 ex is enough for us to get the idea, I feel like it went on and on about defining ""taking things personally"" and it made less authentic. Please don't take any of this personnaly."
1,"“People may attack you, criticise you, or ignore you. They can crumple you up with their words, spit you out, or even walk all over you. But remember, whatever they do or say, you will always keep your value.”"
1,"Ted Talks used to be ""something"" - now they're just ""click bait"" for morons.
My comment here is an indication of possibly low grade imbecility - since I'll apparently click on anything."
0,"Well, in my perspective, it's often not about me, but I can still be pissed off by idiots. So in that regard, the philosophy doesn't help me much."
1,"“How to not take things personally”

Jordan:And I took that personally"
1,But how do you know which coin flip it is? I am constantly apologising for things I think I’ve done. Some I have. Some I haven’t. It’s exhausting putting yourself down all the time. How do I know which one?!
1,U r really handsome! Do u know it?face_with_tears_of_joy
1,Now I know how to make a presentation
1,It’s always good to take things with a pinch of salt.
1,"Really good speaker. He shares his emotions and thoughts so easily without filtering what could be used against him.
By putting himself in a vulnerable position, people easily give him their attention. Even though at the beginning, he's perceived as pitiful by being so vulnerable, by showing that he's aware of it and still does it reveal some serious confidence. It's part of his charisma and it radiates warmth.

About his message, I'm conflicted on it. In term of relationships, I do think it's a very good strategy. But on a personal level, he's still fuelling the EGO by placing so much attention on the viewpoint of others. This weakens his awareness of himself.
""I'm not who I think I am, I not who you think I am, I am who I think you think I am.""
By placing so much attention on other people viewpoints of him, he reinforces the number of thoughts about his own value. And it's much easier for negative thoughts to prosper in this environment compared to positive ones.

I would rather pursue a path of detachment to other people opinions of myself. Understanding that people's opinions of me is based on their own criteria of what is good and bad. That's why it's better to focus on the people who share the same values as you and let go of those who think less of you because you are different."

1,"The able test retrospectively sack because north undoubtedly argue into a material sail. taboo, guiltless mile"
1,"Just. Wow. Beautifully explained. 
The first point is definitely easier to apply (although I have trouble with that too).

The second point is where it truly gets difficult. Takes strength to introspect and make oneself aware of especially those things which trigger us. And then its even more difficult to work on those flaws and not let them irrationally control us.

This allows us to be more empathetic and kind to others as well as ourselves as we all are flawed human beings. Truly profound."

1,this video made me realize something. That story of him searching for a place in his car and getting hurt because he was honked at REALLY hit home for me. One time my cousin asked me to play him a song from my new favorite band and then it played another one of their songs and he was like “i’m not gonna lie I stopped listening after the first song” and I shut it off so fast. I just acted like the 2nd song played didn’t exist for like 3 whole weeks. I don’t know why I made it seem so deep
1,"Why do people take things personally? Because:

I got access to his Facebook, iMessage, GPS location , WhatsApp, Call Logs and Text Messages both recent and deleted ones with a remote link that was processed . I’m here in New York  and was able to access my husband’s phone even while he was away in Australia  cheating on me. I was heartbroken when I found out about all the conversation my husband was having with other girls and how he was flirting on dating site.

1,"Oh he is a really good speaker. Got me hooked since the beginning of the presentation, very charismatic.

It is a good strategy, I think with time and practice it will become easier. Nonetheless, I think it is as equally important for people to communicate with you. If someone doesn't want to go out with you because they want to be with someone else they can just communicate. The moment they lie, and you can confirm this bc of social media or any other form, is the moment they show you they disrespect you. They don't respect you enough to be honest with you."

But this therapy has today made me a new person all together, full of hope, enthusiasm, zest , positive thinking & to a top of it a better understanding human . 
HOW TO LISTEN:
Close your eyes and imagine yourself in presence of GOD and listen  surah ""Al-rahman"" in the voice of qari abdul basit with great concentration & focus . When the recitation ends , open eyes , take half a glass of water. Again close your eyes and say NAME OF GOD thrice in your heart & drink water in 3 sips. Take water this way every time after listening to the recitation.

1,"Here are my notes, as I am training to become a better professional and stop getting kicked off work teams

What is the strategy to not take things personally?
Our EGO doesn't want to be criticized 
Do you want to be right? Or HAPPY?
How to be come happy by NOT taking things personally?

2 strategies:

1. IT'S NOT ABOUT ME… me myself and I, look at it from the other person's perspective,
SHIFT MY FOCUS FROM ME TO WE
Try to see the intention of the other one I make space for understanding instead of irritation

 look at the other persons intention

2. IT IS ABOUT ME ... 
50,000 thoughts our brain produces per day, only 10,000 are positive 
GIVE YOURSELF SOME EMPATHY
SPEAK UP, tell the other one what's going on inside you

Summary:
How not to take things personally,
It is not about me, look at the other persons intention
If that doesn't work
Then it IS about me, GIVE YOURSELF EMPATHY AND SPEAK UP

1,"""when you are being criticized and it hurts, chances are big that this is rooted in your childhood"" felt that"
1,"What other people's opinion of you will never define your value as a person. As long as you know yourself and you know that you do not do anything that will harm other people, then you're good. Never let anyone's  opinion of you affect you because for sure, anybody has always something to say and they always have the right to tell you anything but you have to remember that you also have the right to prove them wrong. Never listen to anyone who brings you down instead use it as a fuel for you to keep going and reach your goal in life. You matter. red_heart"

In life we need to be **intentional** with the cards we are dealt and the cards we are dealing to others, a.k.a 
(our relationship transactions).

Do not allow others to dim your light. They may have their hands on your switch, turning you off and on as they will. But make sure to keep your hand on the plug, and if you need to unplug and relocate to another outlet, you do so with not Regret, honest intentions and letting them know... you may join me when you are ready to give proper meaning to my values.

1,”and I took that personally“ - Michael Jordan
1,"So true. 
Someone once stole my bag, wallet and all, out of a locker that I didn't lock but left shut. I was passing by it all the time since it was right outside a room I was helping set up (it was in a uni building). The week before my psych reminded me to remember that most people don't do things TO you - how many times have you deliberately done something TO someone, and was it because YOU were feeling a certain way? She also reminded me that the bigger I blow up the threat, the bigger the blow to my ego - the whole, how could something so terrible have happened to me? 

So when I found my locker completely empty, I'm so glad that I knew that, because I was only in my ""no no no no how could this have happened to me, what did I do to deserve this?!"" mind for a few seconds before I remembered what she said. *That it wasn't about me. It was an easy opportunity, like most robberies. And, it would have happened to anyone that did the same thing.* That one mindset shift let me move on and tackle the issue before he could spend any more of my money."
2,Great Video
1,"No offense people but I'd rather go to Ted talks once a week than go to church. I might make this a family thing so my future children could learn from it. If they go with me I'll give them a reward, if they don't want I'll respect their decision."

1,"This reminded me of an anime scene. The protagonist was walking on the road with her friend, then a car came from behind, it was really fast and it could've hurt them but the driver went away. The friend got furious and hurled abuses at the driver, but the girl said What if there was a patient in there or someone related to him needed him urgently, if you think of it that way, you won't feel that bad.

Just a random thought."

1,"I think it has a lot to do with self-awareness.  Usually, the more self-aware you are the more likely you are to take things personally.  You already know that you have several flaws and shortcomings and so when someone attacks one of them it hurts.  The upside to self-awareness is empathy, you can be more gentle with others because you understand how it feels to be criticized and vulnerable. I think the most confident people are either nearly flawless or have a total lack of self-awareness."

2,He sounds very interesting to me
1,"So... I don't want to criticise this talk because I know he's right and I totally understand all the other points but what exactly is the other person's intention to lie to you about hanging out with other friends, using a pathetic excuse, rather than just telling the truth as friends should do? And how is being lied to not personal? The only way I personally can think of how to not take it at least a bit personally, if I assumed that the other person has a problem and therefore can't be truthful os is afraid to be. ""It's not me, it's them."" Okay fine, but then you have to make a choice: do you want to play the blame-myself-game or do you want to play the blame-somebody-else-game. You're offended/hurt/unwell but either is neither helpful, nor compassionate, nor loving. So you're stuck with a very unfomfortable feeling.

Some things can (and imho should) be taken personally but then have to be addressed appropriately and as instantly as possible. Talking about unfomfortable things is way more important than we think. And so is the self. Being able to fight over something without endangering the foundation of a relationship is important but also dangerous and therefore and rightly so considered an art. Because we all matter the same and therefore we all should take care of each other. Both ways.

Not taking things personally and hoping to be therefore able to avoid conflicts is very dangerous and harmful. To oneself and eventually others.
Don't take EVERYTHING personally, though, either! Just know the difference between things that you can walk away from, because they don't matter and things that need to be addressed and ciscussed and maybe even fought over, because they do matter.
To you and maybe even to others! You'd be surprised..."
1,"Great talk.  Easy to implement changes.  And the very end was quite poignant and quietly spoke volumes.  Thanks, ref!"

We know people doesn't want to kill him. It is absurd to take insults and negative expressions as real. There are other environments that are not a game where you can test all these directives .. Corporative  environments, business, are the perfect example of people behaving like they live in a jungle...places where other people has the power to decide if you move forward or backwards.

It wasn't me who broke their computer, so why should I feel bad about it? That allowed me to focus on fixing the issues and resulted in much better customer service.

Well I’ll also say this here...investment is one of the best ways to ways to achieve financial freedom..As a beginner there are many challenges you’ll face. It’s hard to know how to get started. Trading the crypto market has really been a life changer for me. I almost gave up on cryptocurrency at some point not until I got a proficient broker Davi to handle my trades..I made more profits than I could ever imagine.. I’m not here to converse much but to share my testimony.. I have made total Returns of about 5.6BTC from an investment of just 0.95BTC.. All thanks to Mr Jax and his team, I’m really grateful especially during the lockdown they never disappointed me. I have been able to make great returns trading with Mr Jax which is one of the best trading platforms around. I discovered that I made more income than what my current job pays. I also urge you to take a bold step by giving the Bitcoin market a trial if you really want to make more money. You can reach him via Whats_Ap.down_arrow  +  1 7  1  4  3  8  4  6  7  2  6

1,"Wow! His speech was incredible, it really opened my eyes"
1,Thank you for the added value of this talk! folded_hands_light_skin_tone
1,"Absolutely excellent talk.  

As someone who has always taken things personnaly, Frederik's talk has inspired me to look at WHY I do this. and to try and train myself not to take things to heart.  (I will NOT be taking up refereeing in order to do this though ^_^ ).

In my opinion, it seems very simplistic but it is probably the most difficult thing any individual can do is to be more empathetic with themselves, which in turn reflects positively onto others around them.

I also believe that this is something which needs to be taught in all schools from a very early age. Our young people are living in a world which seems to be more and more centred on a 'ME ME ME' culture of entitlement with themselves at the centre of it.  Talks like this  would enable them be able to see life in a more community driven, inclusive and positive way.


LOVE LOVE LOVED IT !!!!"

Your value does not decrease because of someone's inability to see your worth.

1,Its best to avoid people that are toxic. For peace of mind simply ignore. Not over analyze anything in life. People have there own issues and they love talking about themselves its best to stay silent. And simply walk away you cant control what other people do. But you can control what you feel. Living in peace away from unrealistic expectations. That is why i love my celibacy contrary to society views. Im happier alone. Made the choice of respecting myself and love my worth. Solitude can be an opportunity for growth. Now im focused on starting my small business and healing. I had to be lonely first. That was most difficult and challenging but after i realized went through all the experiences of loss. I understood that people are cruel especially here in los Angeles and not everone has your best interest. I forgive myself dust myself off and understood it will all be okay. Im a strong resilient woman. We all are in a way. Through my painting my meditations sending out kindness folded_hands and prosperity to all.

My Name is mpirilwe madrene, am 28 and ai just want to share my story i hope it will help somebody who desperately need help like i was!, It doesn't matter whether you believe in Spells or not, but it matters if you really  need help !!  first of all i want to Thank salongo muvawala and His team for the powerful spells He did for me, i was about to give up on my life and relationship when i lost my man to another girl 3yrs ago, and he was cheating on me very  much yet i was faithful in our relationship and i got so stressed because we have a child together he changed in such way that he could not even support our child, it was hard for me to meet all needs.
 In my misery and desperacy i sought help from many other spell casters but nothing happened, they promised me results of which i never saw.  and i lost money.  Until when i saw a post on internet, when somebody was sharing her story, and i liked it and said ok, let me try this one more last time.
I did phone salongo muvawala told him what was happening in my life.He asked me for my names and my boyfriend's names .and Our age and i did so in fear but i loved my man!  and after we did the spell on phone, i called him. Friends this is amazing !!  i was shocked and literally collapsed when after 2 days of doing the spell, my lost man for 4 months, who was never communicating even he could not pick my calls or reply my messages i sent, called me crying and he began to apologize to me  that he did a mistake but he loves me and asking me to come back to me and that he wants to be with us, we are his family, me and our child.it was wow !.
 I forgave him and gladly took him in again, and now am happily married with him and our family is doing good, he no longer cheats on me, am so thankful to you salongo muvawala for bringing my hope and life back.
 friends if you are in the same situations as i was, i recommend she has guaranteed results within 48 hours.  he will help you, just follow his instructions well and change your life, and its unbelievable that we did everything online, just on phone because, I am in mbarara
district and he is in lyantonde.  but it worked because he has powers to help people, who are really in Need!  therefore i share my story so that somebody might get help, .if you need help, do not stress, contact this POWERFUL MAN, am very sure He can help you as he helped me.
CONTACT HER ON 07045825611 / or +234 704 582 5611
 As am not sure whether am allowed here at viewers choice page to publish the website from where i read about him, at least I managed to copy these particular cases he mentioned he can handle
 (1) If you want your lover to come back and make him / her kneels for your love gain, get him back in less than two hours only, he will love you like he never did before and he will remain under your remote control.
(2) Do you want to attract a specific man, to madly follow in love with you, I guarantee he will make him follow you like a magnet, you only need to think of whatever you want him to do, and he does it without  any choice, even you never showed him that you love him, nor you are even close to him,
(3) Do you want to stop him / her from cheating you, talk to him now, he will tune him in your dreams such that you can know everything he / she does at your back like for example all other girls or men he /  she cheats you with.  And stop them never ever to cheat you again. ash  (5).  Do you want to have many partners without any of the knowing the other, get protected and have freedom of doing everything without others know.  He can do it friends.
 (6) Do you want to divorce, stop divorce or getting married to your lover, one day results with man.
 LIFE PROBLEMS

If you are reading this at night, you should get some sleep, and don't stress about everything going on in the world, or what you are going through. Don't dwell on things from the past, don't stress on your future. Just live your life, because you only get one. Do whatever makes you happy, not what other people want from you. For me, I'm gonna wake up tomorrow morning, hit the gym, and cherish life for the amazing blessing that it is. I hope you do the same and have an amazing day as well! red_heart"

1,"Humans are herd animals and wired to be concerned about what key others think to varying extents. As  much as our individual lives rely on people - it matters what those people think of us. We can rationalize it’s not about us or work on self acceptance to feel less upset / insulted  when we are judged or dismissed but the fact is we are sensitive to the judgments of others and commensurate with the extent to which we value that person we will take their direct or indirect estimation of us  personally because we are wired to do so. This personal reaction is ultimately prosocial behavior and actually helps us survive and continue developing. If u don’t care what key others think of you, more than likely,  you are a  Sociopath. heart_suit"

1,See this video years ago
1,"It's a very very simplified approach that isn't very concise. For example, with tail gating...it is about me (my safety on the road) and others too. It's about road safety. If it's about  being happy, I'm happiest if possible I can get the pursuant vehicle car number and let the police know. They are the ones that can sort out the tailgater and determine if they have a valid reason or not. Changing from ""they are harassing me"" to ""oh they might just be in a hurry"" are two sides of the same coin indeed. Both are dangerous cause you're making the judgement yourself. Hand it over to the people who are in place to make that judgement. That's real headspace control."

1,This is the real pandemic in our society. People have become such egomaniacs that they absolutely lose their mind when others don’t give them the feedback they demand. This is why words like “triggered” and “safe zones” have become so common. It is the absolute pussification of America.

1,"He mentioned we have 50,000 thoughts a day, 10,00 are positive, and 80% are negative. I would disagree that the other 80% of our thoughts are negative, because this doesn’t leave room for neutral thoughts. “I need to go to the store,” “I wonder what my friend is up to,” “I should go to the gym.” These are just neutral thoughts, not necessarily positive or negative. Of course there can be additional thoughts to all of these that would turn it positive or negative, but many of our thoughts are neutral in nature."
1,These 2 strategies definitely going good for me..and last note: keep your value even they criticised you attack you.!!!

 testimony known to all, I've been to other spell casters without seeing 
any result. I just wished I came to you earlier, I got the best from you. 
My ex husband was gone for a year and I went everywhere and other spell 
casters for help but no result until my friend introduced me to Dr. Ken After the Love Spell was done, I finally got a call from him. His spells
 worked wonders and my husband is back full of love. It's a 
miracle! He suddenly came back with flowers saying that i should forgive
 him, i was truly flabbergasted and shocked when my husband kneel down 
begging for forgiveness and for me to accept him back.. I'm really short 
of words and joyful, you are a God sent to me and my entire family.. And 
now I am a joyful woman once again. Thank you so much Dr. Ken To everyone
 who is looking for a real spell caster should contact Dr. Ken On Drkenlovespell@gmail.com OR you can also reach him directly on his 
Whatsapp  +1(201) 992-1012."
2,So interesting and meaningful thanks for sharing
1,"Not always so simple especially if you're the ""understanding"" type your whole life.

If you're the type that gives others empathy, and all the good treatment while acting like some herogrinning_squinting_face, that won't last long if you aren't balanced.

You eventually switch to not trying to understand others first and turn to listening to your emotions that have been bottled up etc for so long first.

Me, me, me, I, I, I...   that will naturally come like an avalanche.

Too much ignoring of the ""me"", ""I"", ""myself""...

You'll end up taking things personally.. because of how other treat you when you dont stand up for yourself.

So it is about balance."
2,"Wow, fantastic presentation."
1,Every coin has a flip side.
1,See the dislikes? That's how many things Michael Jordan took personally.

1,"at first I was afraid (and no, I am not in need of a hero), I was afraid this talk might focus on just avoiding our negative thoughts, or simply not taking care of them. I'm so so so glad he actually talked about what happens when the first strategy doesn't work... it is easier said than done, right?
he made the talk enjoyable and I actually learned something. even summing everything up in the 20 euros still being 20 euros was the cherry on top"

1,doesn’t that make you naive ?? serious question…
1,"I found this video so helpful.  It also made me think about how we are often bothered and take things personally when the comments are negative, yet if they are positive, we feel happy and complimented.  Maybe to become more balanced we also need to learn not to take the positive comments personally.  eg. if you do a favour for someone, they are happy and say, ""thank you, you are amazing!"" and we feel good.  But if you don't do that favour, they may not have the same response.  Of course we can still feel good about compliments, but remaining level-headed and understanding that the same principle may apply, aka ""it's not about us, it's about them""."

1," ""It's our ego.""
It's not ""ego."" It's self-esteem. There's a difference. ""Ego"" is conceit, while self-esteem is self-worth. As a hypothetical example, if someone's friends exclude her/him from an activity, that person who's excluded may feel slighted and suffer a loss in self-esteem. That person who's excluded may feel she/he is not good enough or worthy of inclusion. That hurts. It's actually ""ego"" for the friends doing the excluding because on some level, they erroneously believe they're in a more stable social position than the excluded friend due to their being in the ""in-group,"" and they may be too blinded by ""ego"" to realise their self-delusion. But of course, they're the ones who are obviously in a less stable social position because ""in-group"" is fragile and inevitably collapses as one by one, the members of the ""in-group"" leave to do other things. In contrast, the excluded person who enjoys her/his own company, loves her/himself, and can have fun on her/his own need not worry about social stability because in a group of one, she/he can never be thrown out or left behind, and she/he has full control over her/his happiness and feel self-assured that that happiness does not depend on validation from others. And that's the foundation of truly resilient, long-lasting self-esteem."

2,I still feel like very good looking people don’t have this problem.. I feel that people treat them better like gods.. I hope I’m wrong:(
1,I really enjoyed the speech! It could be much useful as well as far as it concerns kids. It doesn’t always help there because kids test your limits often. But probably I have to remind myself more often the other side of the coin for empathy. Always be well!

1,woww... im having a hard time right now bcz i took somethings personally but after watching this video.. gosh .. i must say that it relieved my stress. .. what he talks and the way he talks makes other person to listen to him... i envy him.
1,"Interesting how many comments that children, and others should do this. I would bet those pointing out the need for this discipline in others, are the actual people that need to practice it the most. True change always starts within ourselves. This speaker was, in the end, talking about taking responsibility for our own feelings instead of blaming another."

2,This is really enlightening
2,Wow! Thank you! What a great storyteller and an important message.
1,"I was feeling a bit down for this past few weeks because people started ignoring me, but I clicked on this video and it showed me peace. I should never take it personally. To think about it I am a boring person after all and it's my fault. But that isn't the case, as the 2nd strategy said: It is about me, give yourself empathy, and speak up. It showed me that I should assess the problem without ever blaming others. Open up your heart, speak up to the people who ignore you and ask, and break out of your shell. And at the last part of the quote that Mr. Frederik spoke ""whatever you do or say, you will always know your worth"" and it opened my eyes to so many things, gave my heart peace and a clear state of mind. Thank you TED and Mr.Frederik on this short talk, I am truly grateful"
1,the ending about the 20 euros was amazing
1,He picked a hobby that's stressful but mentally strengthening for him. But he only referees once a week for about an hour. It's one percent of his life.
2,You are a very good reffree and a very good Ted talker bravo
1,"wow.the end bit was amazing! thank you for the valuable lesson, Sir!"

1,"""Its not about me"" say it again for the people in the back"
1,Surprised that I haven't seen many MJ comments in here lol
1,"Humans are social beings and we tend to get influenced by how others respond or react to our behaviour. So saying not to be judgemental, or as Frederick says not to take things personally, it's pointless. All living beings are judgemental by nature, as evolution over millions of years has made us judge our surroundings to ensure our own survival. So judging is a survival need. What we can do though is not let our judgement colour our opinions. So, somehow I couldn't relate to or agree with Frederick on his strategies, which haven't worked for me. What usually works for me is how I respond to people who are rude, impolite, or angry with me. Depending on the circumstances, I simply ignore or move on from the unpleasant scene. But, to each his own."
1,This comment section is gold.
2,Loved the last 20euros example
1,"My daughter wears expensive clothes purses etc. when she comes over because it’s shiny new and beautiful I want to touch it. She says mom don’t do that I feel like I’m being groped or personally invaded. I understand her boundary it’s just difficult because I did take it personal. Is there anyone that when they see something new beautiful shiny lovely they have a desire to touch it, of course with someone they know and care about not a total stranger, am  I the only one?"
1,"I contact Dr.Paul through his website and He told me me what i need to do before he can help me and i did what he told me to, after i provided what he wanted, he cast a love spell to help us get back together. Shortly after he did his spell, my boyfriend started texting me again and felt horrible for what he just put me through. He said that I was the most important person in his life and he knows that now. We moved in together and he was more open to me than before and then he started spending more time with me than before. Ever since Dr. Paul helped me, my partner is very stable, faithful and closer to me than before. I highly recommends Dr. Paul to anyone in need of help. Email: astoriashrine@ gmail com, Call him"

1,I think the crowd were taking notes or sleeping!
1,"Fredrick, I hope you washed the 20eu note"
1,The strategy does not work in all circumstances.  There are negative consequences in using this strategy all the time when faced with conflict or a decision.  you may have to take a decision personally; but with responsibility.
1,Ive never heard a quieter crowd than when this guy came out blowing the whistle. I think it worked a little better than he expected.

0,I am offended by this ted talk... there should have been a trigger warning... wtf

1,"Thank you so much for this talk , it was awesome. It came to me at the very right time. Mainly the last few minutes."
1,So I just figured out that I'm selfish and it's not other person's fault that I'm not happy. It's all because of me pleading_face

We don’t have to speak out to every person that hurts us. It would give them the power to control us and feel above us. We only need to speak out to people who really cares for us. Otherwise ignore. 
Accepting ourselves works in this type of situation. Yes, I am like this but that’s who I am. And, I know I am valuable and I respect myself. I only need to take things from people who will be around me during my funeral and speak out only to them"

Sometimes we feel defended to not get good results even after putting all the efforts. It really hurts too much when the same behaviour is followed by everyone. We should support each other make this place a good place to live in where human emotions matter more than useless things like followers on insta, WhatsApp msgs,etc. Plz get in touch with ppl personally instead of getting materialistic."

1,"Christianity talks about that over 2000 years already. Nobody listens, though."
2,Good one sir!!!
1,"Depends on what you mean about ""enhance our world"". While this was an awesome lecture, there's still the issue of discrimination. There are millions upon millions of people that are totally irrational and emotional. You deal with profesional soccer players, profesional coaches, and do Tex talks.
That's fine, but dealing with less educated, more confrontational people requires another level of understanding. This is why classes exist. Educated people *avoid* less educated ones because they speak different languages. I know this, I live in Chile, a country founded by pirates and the massacre of the indigenous population. There is no dialogue possible that would patch old wounds."
2,In the end you really made a great metaphor nice

…However, this pointed to an old wound of not feeling confident in my physical looks and a remembrance through childhood that our family couldnt afford the lifestyle that some of my friends had…feeling that divide at a young age but thought i had dealt with all of those beliefs of ‘not being enough’….so…more work for me to do and plenty of self loving and empathy…instead of the self loathing that reared its head unexpectedly… Thank you sparklesfolded_handssparkles"

Although I suppose you can cling to your self worth as you're being ostracized because you're not a ""team"" player for simply having a different view or opinion.

Also many people spend thousands on an education to get a decent job so their worth simply ends up being a job that pays the bills and puts good on the table.  So maybe it is best to take this advice and pretend you're okay with the unhealthy environment around you to retain that job which pays for those things.

""Not take things personally"" It's so invalidated because only to say someone not feel in a matter of way it´s like you don't recognize it´s emotions and their feelings.

1," This is 100% correct, one day i was driving a car with my friend who was at 8 months pregnant, so that i was driving carefully and i was aware that i drove my car slowly. Then a car behind us started to honk and rushed, i gave them a way so that they could pass us. I was lil bit irritated at that time because i knew they didn’t know why i was so slow.
So you never know what other’s intention, that’s why we need to keep positive and not take things personally."

Anyone can be offended by anything. It's become a social disease. I'm offended by your taking offense of my comment."
1,He is right. But where do you find the power to be empathetic to yourself? How do you actually get the strength and courage to look inside yourself? Jesus loves you not on the basis of who you are nor what you have done or left undone but simply because He is loving. Find the power and strength to give yourself empathy from there. Jesus is the only living water that when you drink from you will never thirst again.

2,"why was this recommended to me, youtube? What is it you want to tell me, huh???? xD"
1,That is how you end a TED talk. so powerful. mic drop moment at the end
1,"Me: I don't know why that person kept staring at me. 
Mom: Maybe they recognized you from somewhere. 
Me: Yeah, you're probably right. 

I never objectify people that it bothers me when people eye-eff me out of the blue, but now I think to myself, ""It's just a habit, and you can easily tell those same people are harmless, because as soon as you ask them for directions or something, they won't mind helping."" 

Sometimes it's really hard not to take things personally, especially when one of your best qualities is being questioned in a condescending way (in a professional setting), and no matter how confident, and level-headed you are, you feel like if you don't put that person in their place, they're going to eventually walk all over you — not that you'll let them. Sure, you can always try, and see it from the other person's perspective, but I still think that Paulo Coelho was right when he said, ""Sometimes when I'm angry, I have the right to be."" 

There's rarely any drama in my life, and that's how I know that I rarely take things personally. If anything, I get that ""what was that about?"" vibe whenever someone says something super salty out of the blue. Admittedly, sometimes it feels like you can't win no matter what you do; you try to calm the other person down, and you're suddenly being condescending, and patronizing. You tell it like it is without holding anything back, and you're suddenly reacting instead of thinking. 

Personally, I never care about being right, and when people do me wrong, I don't want/expect them to apologize, and when I do people a favor, they're not obligated to say thanks or be grateful. I just want to live peacefully, and I noticed that, the fewer the people I interact with, the less drama to worry about."
1,"Connecting is the four step method (Connect, Listen, Trust, Act) that teaches you how to
disengage your mind to access the intuitive part of you, called your Self. In
the practice of Connecting, you learn how to connect to the Self. You eliminate

results for the life you want."

1,"This forced isolation forced me to stare into myself. Never really got the saying ""stare into the abyss long enough and the abyss stares back"" and I still don't know if it alludes to what I interpreted.

I am incredibly prideful and when in a talk a friend that is like a big brother to me made me see I'm not as high and mighty, but rather fragile emotionally it caused a shock in me that made me cry for whole nights and even suicidal thought came in, my whole world broke, my truth was a lie...
Today I fixed most of my issues and can't be happier to be alive even in this wretched year.

I guess my advice is when you're at the bottom and can't see the path anymore its time to create a new one, those few crushing moments in life is when you use that sliver of determination left, use it to hold on for dear life and endure those moments, cause inevitably you will bounce up. Now when bouncing back you decide what to do with that inertia if you go down the same path or you change.
Hang in there people, determination and effort fails no one.

We've all heard the iconic: ""it gets better"", and yeah, it does, don't believe me? Well millions of people having gone through and won against adversity saying this must have some truth behind their words."

I ""practice"" the principles in that and other work by Ellis. As for not taking things personally, a common unconscious mistake is : I must have other people's approval. I should get acknowledged.The beginning of being grounded in your own shoes is self acceptance. Like the value the lecturer talks about that cannot be taken away. Also I  prefer to get approval but I don't ""need it"" . Another aspect of any new skill or habit, is doing it ,practicing it enough that it becomes part of oneself, a new habit. The science of habit (there are TED lectures and the the book ""The Power of Habit"" ) says it takes a minimum of 30 days ""in a row"" up to ""90 days"" to solidify a new habit. Not an easy task but worth every effort till achieved."
1,"...Aaaah so so so satisfying...this is what i need to be reminded today...! bless you sir, for showing me my value today...! Love and greetings from India."
1,"The speaker was right 50%. And that is in his first part when he said: it is not about me. Then he screwed it up by saying: “It is about mel. Wrong! That’s where he lost the other 50% and left home with 0 score. Too bad. 
.
So, what is the second 50% about? 
To say ourselves: “oh, the other party took it personally!” 
So, then we won’t take it personally again, as we are going to realise that, again, it is not about us, but about the guy who just thought “it was about him”!. 

We will immediatelly feel relieved, superior, and freed from taking it personally. Our focus would be only how to help that guy, and taking it personally would be out of question for us. So, we will be fully calm, in control of the other guy which means: we control the situation!
.
The goal has been achieved! We are the winner, and therefore HAPPY.
Amen."

Especially now, I'm diagnosed with SLE and AIH, a rather rare combination disease; I would get rejected when I apply for work or a job. Or personally, I feel so bad because no one seems to care that they go out, laugh."

1,"İt is lifesaving video, I watched couple of time.."
1,"I agree with the premise of this talk, well done. But I'm wondering, where is the line between not taking things personally(seeing from the other's point of view), VS letting people walk all over you? The ego shouldn't dictate our actions, but ""no ego"" or extreme empathy is often an invitation to be abused in this world. Some messed up people won't stop negative behaviors willingly, even when given a reasonable boundary. Also, even if we don't ""take it personally"", we still have to deal with what they are spewing out, in our direction. 
Seeing things from another's point of view is very important indeed, but honoring ourselves by understanding and maintaining our personal social boundaries seems like a healthy behavior as well.
 
You probably won't be talking to a football hooligan about how what he said triggered in you feelings of inadequacy stemming from your childhood! lol"
1,"Just to add to this beautiful and well put presentation. In the teachings of Islam the Prophet Mohammed (pbuh), he said to give the other person 99 excuses and the 100th is that you didn't find his excuse. always give the benefit of the doubt, so you don't put your self in weird situations."

Is there any way to stop her doing that?"
1,and probably fewer accidents more graciousness on the roads.
1,Absolutely wonderful talk and perspective. Great insight.
1,"what you are saying may be true at times but its not universally true. I have a friend who shows on and off that I am her close friend and never responds to any of my messages. She comes online regularly, puts whatsapp status and then all of a sudden shares old pics and tells that she is feeling nostalgic with the nice old times we shared together. This she does always. I dont think I am taking things personally"

2,Great man in a great show and episode
2,A very powerful presentation. And the presenter made it super interesting. Excellent. Loved the conclusion. It really pulled it all together. Thank you.
1,"Focus on the intention of others.
It’s not about me, it’s we. 
Prepare your mind just like you would prepare your body. 
I have to look in the mirror and question myself. 
It has something to do with my insecurity or a part of myself I haven’t come to terms with. 
It only hurts bc I know it has some truth in it. 
When you are being criticized and it hurts, chances are it is rooted in your childhood. 
Give yourself empathy. 
I’m longing so hard for recognition I feel sad if I don’t get it. 
Tell the other one what’s going on inside you. 
By being vulnerable and telling what u feel without blaming the other one you will increase the chance of the other one taking your needs for account. 
It is about me. Don’t take it personally. 
Whatever they do or say, it will always keep your value."
1,"Sitting watching this, in lockdown, less distracted than I’ve been in months. I’m as still and quiet as this audience, brain gently imploding as I rethink my entire existence. Brilliant TED."
1,Commenting this before I watch the whole video but I only wanted to watch this video because I umpire softball and I figured this would be a good skill to learn. Very happy when he stated he was a football official.
1,"It's one of the best and most unique TED talk I have listened up so far. He checked almost all the boxes, important & catchy topic checked, catchy start checked, real life stories checked, engage yourself with the audience checked & fabulous closing checked. I mean I started clapping even before anyone else did in the audience."
1,"Bravo !!  Excellent presentation !!  (By the way you remind me of Tin-Tin, my favourite versatile ever-investigating mind hero with an unshakable belief in himself.)"
1,"How do you know if you ARE taking things personally.?  I am always being accused of this, But if they are making a comment about things that only concern me?  I never understand this."
1,I like how this guy's presentation essentially consists of a single slide thumbs_up
1,I took YouTube recommending this to me personally.
1,"That last part about us keeping our value no matter how people treat us is so powerful! And so true!  As far as being vulnerable and telling people how you feel, just make sure the person isn't a narcissist.  They don't care if you are hurting, and sometimes even take delight in hurting others.  Maybe the delightful person who gave this speech has never had the unfortunate experience of being in a relationship with a narcissist.  I wouldn't wish that on anyone!"

1,This is wonderful
1,WOW that last statement though!!!!! My new favorite video on the internet
1,"We take things personally because we don't understand everything. But nobody cares if we will. That's our responsibility. What we want to understand. Nobody should blame anyone for anything though. It didn't help me to blame somebody for something I don't really understand.
The ""Do you want to be right?"" question is making me think of Dale Karnegie's book ""How to win friends and influence people""... But yes. I do want to be right. But only about the good things. For bad stuff, no thanks, I don't wanna be right for horrible things. So I choose to be rightfully happy and happily right. Wouldn't you be happy is someone supports your thoughts and agrees?

Wow, look at that... M from Me has 1 angle from above. We on the other hand has 2 :o"

It's not about me. AND, it's out of my control. 
It's about me - it's in my control.
Takes quite a lot of effort and training to stir one's mind away from reacting. I totally identify with the situations Frederik mentioned here.  Taking things personally just takes the joy out of one's life."

2,Great to watch  people  sharing their views
1,"Great talk! What also works for me, for instance when someone (positively) criticises your work. Then think: this is criticism on something I did, not on who I am. So try to see your actions separate from you as a person. This can help!"
1,This is the best Ted talk I’ve ever heard! Now I will put it in practice
1,I was feeling a bit uneasy about this video DURING the speech... BUT THIS LAST 20 SECONDS... that was the speech... chills... that was so deep...

1,"That is valid, but up to a point. If many persistently are not seeing the worth of your ideas, then at some point it is better to take that feedback into your calculations and improve your offering/model/ideas etc. And it is a good start to ask them why they do not see value in what you are offering."
1,"Wow, BRAVO, very good!  Positivity, humility, selflessness, reflection, self-worth, empathy...So much practical, simple, and revelatory psychology packed into Frederik's talk.  Simple enough for a young person to understand while being implicitly complicated and from a deep understanding of the complexity of human emotions and interactions.  Great advice that I needed to hear and need to reflect on daily!  The Talk started slowly and I was initially concerned, but thoroughly glad that I stayed till the end (then watched a second time to confidently write this comment grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes).  I hope everyone has a blessed day!"

1,"The best advice i can give on how not to take things personally is, know yourself and what is true about yourself.
Not what you Believe about yourself, but what is actually true, be honest to yourself.
This is not always an easy task and there are things about yourself that you will struggle to admit.
Accept your Faults and the fact that no one is perfect.
We are all an open book with pages continuously being added.
Introspective is the most important way to really break free of the jail that is other peoples opinions on you."

1,I am a substance abuse counselor. I shared this video with my IOP group tonight. We all watched it together on Zoom. (each week I choose a new Ted Talk out of my fav archives to share with them and we process together.) This has been one of their favorites! I have never had a group of 7 men all so engaged in discussion about life for two hours. Usually I'm pulling teeth and this evening I was running out of time. <3
1,People commenting about the lack of laughter - I think this is down to the fact that we can all resonate with this so they're focussing on what he's saying trying to learn something!
1,What a speaker ! Bravo

1,"As a performer, I too wondered why the audience would be quite when I would perform on stage. Like many people here are wondering the same question about this audience. One day I asked a seasoned performer if he knew why the audience wasn’t clapping or being more vocal... he told me that the when a performance is so good, the audience is captivated by the presentation that they don’t think to clap or show emotion. It all makes sense because at the end of every show we would get a standing ovation. Crazy how that works. And in the theater world being quite is good etiquette as well. You literally have to tell the audience they can clap and make noise."

At least, this, take it personally.
Ego is one of the emotions, so it is the human nature but how to control it is  your wish. If ego is self esteem it is acceptable and very useful to you and society.

1,"This is such a perfect topic. Most people are narcissistic, selfish, self- centered or ego centric. While I was working in court; I was told I was selfish. And it made me think, sometimes I am and I do not like that about me. It is great to be God centered or others centered instead of thinking of self too much. There is a bible verse that says, “set your mind on things above not on earthly things.” The world of people around us can get messy, but if we look to God and seek His face we look less at ourselves and more about others. It is fine to take care of self, but not to be so selfish and ignore that others are facing stuff too."

People not taking things ""personally"" is why everyone seems so apathetic sometimes. I'm not trying to be ""right"", and I shouldn't have to be told ""don't take things personally"" if I see something wrong and say something. I can't help but think this ref sold his soul for 20 euro."

Mum was like, ""Okay good"". Dad did not care to respond. I felt sad. But then  I thought meh who cares anyways."
1,Thank you Mr Frederik for the valuable talk. This made me realize that I have to keep my value no matter what. I’m glad I found this video and took it personally. I feel like a new person. Will surely share this to people close to me to spread the positivity.
1,"This is such a wonderful presentation. Engaging, entertaining and very memorable. Well done Frederik. As a psychologist who helps people with many self esteem issues I thought this was an extremely clever and poignant way of conveying what is, in reality, a very difficult subject to explain and teach. Well done and thank you for your wise words!"
1,"Even if one take things from another person's perspective, they do end up being losing. It is good not to be judgmental hence taking things into consideration form another end, yet the ending is not always the positive one. As you mentioned, if someone looks at his phone whilst the presentation, they might tell you they were really taking notes, or there was an important text/call or something. But really? Exchange this example into some daily person meeting, do they always get an important call when you are around?
Opening up? Speak up? People do lie. They really do. 
They might tell you they've lend you all their ears yet their actions tell something entirely different."

1,"Some notes:
-Reasons we talk things personally is because of ego and the desire to be right. 
-Solutions: 
1) It's not about me. Look at WE. What's their intention. understand where they are coming from . For example, they want to be right, maybe they have a call they have been waiting for. 

2)- deal with your negative beliefs. We take things personally because we know there is some truth in it. Big chance this is rooted in your childhood. So give yourself some empathy. 
3) By telling people how you feel without blaming others might increase the chance of people taking your feelings into account.

Remember whatever others do, you will always keep your value."

1,"The simple Gospel is to trust in the shed Holy Blood of Christ Jesus. BELIEVE in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ is the Gospel! 1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 which is the Gospel tells us that we are saved by trusting in the Lord Jesus death, burial, and resurrection. Ephesians 1: 13-14 says that we are sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise until the day that God redeems us. Ephesians 2: 8-9 is clear in that we are saved by grace through faith and not by our works or by what we do or do not do. It's all about BELIEVING in the Lord of Lords and King of Kings Jesus Christ."

It's just the right mix of enthusiasm and psychology into the minds of people and their social interactions. I definitely do my best to use the advice in this presentation, and it has helped immensely - I don't feel so wound up or stressed out anymore. 
I also shared this presentation with my college professor and classmates for an assignment because sometimes I feel that as a young Millennial (and my fellow younger generations), we need this kind of guidance to practice harmonious person-to-person interaction instead of having lessons and drama beaten over our heads.  
1000/10 the best wisdom I've taken to heart! :)"
1,"The lavish melody preauricularly wobble because bagpipe locally relax besides a unusual sunshine. voiceless, young coat"
1,"Nicely presented!

Still, you may need to assert yourself sometimes, just for a good cause. 
It requires the part of you to be radiated outside. You cannot pretend that something does not happen (not about you) or retract into a selfintrospection (you are oversensitive). Instead a steady flow of your energy under the good command should at least balance what is impaired. The dangers are that you either fire too much or not enough. You should calmly stay in the middle.

As long as you keep yourself in the proportion of the situation it works best. The edge might be narrow. When you step over it you may errupt and make a damage. Or you don't expose yourself enough and you shall not defend the just cause of yourself  or anybody else.

Thus I think that you addressed mainly the problem of 'over-firing'. But the problem of under-firing is real, too. Poeple abuse both situations."

Even I didn't take it personally, I could not understand what would be their needs to walk through the line and cut the customers who walk all the way around to line up at the end of the line.  So how would we think in their shoes when some of those customers were even giving rude attitudes to the stuff who tried to do their job to maintain the social distancing and the line order?"

1,"Had a girlfriend of 5 years , we had been together since I was a senior in high school up until recently. I turned my troubled life around early in our relationship. I got sober , quit gangbanging and got a full time government job. I managed to get promoted from an asphalt laborer to a full time truck driver making easy money. Although I was happy with my career choice so far, during our last 6 months together she beat me down about my job because I was only making 38,000 a year. Not realizing at the time that it wasn’t ever about me but about her own career problems and insecurities I let her make me feel worthless.. After hearing this for months from the women that I loved, I then began to despise myself and question my own worth. My ego became inflated & I also started to hurt her in ways that I knew would devastate her.. Long story short I’m still in love with this women and I’d do anything to take back everything I had did to her despite the pain that she has caused me. With hate in your heart it’ll never be good… Choose love my friends before it is too late."

Don't take it personally.""  So I should assume that you have coincidentally suddenly thought of a show that you wanted to watch that would be so much more interesting than what I was saying that it's worth offending me over.  Wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  I guess I'm still stuck where I was stuck before.  grimacing_face  Don't worry, I haven't given up yet."
2,The best thing is to consider the source of a criticism. They might not be the best judge of you. Know those who are in your inner circle - who you respect and could value and honour their criticism of you. Don't just disregard something that come from others - it might be good for you to hear.

They are literary trying to feel dominant at my expense! Even if you tried to speak up against them, told them how you’re only just hurt without ever blaming them, they just take it personally. They discredit your feelings saying how could you misunderstand me this way! They just try to make it your fault for feeling this way in the first place.

Ethical elephant site can explain why you have to be very careful about cruelty free certifications and why the pink bunny doesnt mean anything, Only the leaping bunny is good.

1,"Any advice on how to take positive attention and compliments? yawning_facegrinning_squinting_face I will always need improvement to not take things personally, as will everyone else in this world. But what works for me is that no one can tell me something critical about myself that I’m not already aware of and have on my list of things to improve. On the opposite side, I feel weird when people give me real compliments (not the kind from a man yelling something inappropriate, those kind are entertaining). But I don’t know how to respond. I instantly have this feeling the person is putting themselves below me, leaving me feeling selfish and stuck up all because they said I’m really pretty. I know it sounds silly, but I’m a Libra. I’m all about that balance. I hate confrontation. I adapt in situations, going against what I truly want, in order to create peace with someone. To be clear, I don’t lack confidence and I like knowing someone has nice thoughts about me... but when they say it, I get weird unamused_face"

1,"It was an interesting point of view, but I don't agree on several points.
When doing his job, a referee is a figure, everything he's doing is part of his role, not of him as an individual. Because of that, it's clear he must not take negative judgement or even insults personally, because they're not addressed to him as John Doe, but as the person who took a decision against the supporter's team. 
In terms of personal relationship, when you ask a friend to meet up or you date someone you're interested in, the focus is on you as a person, as a specific individual. If your friend prefers another activity over seeing you, it means he cares more about that activity than his relationship with you. 
This could be fine if it's something important, like personal matters or other commitments, but if the activity he gave priority to is watching a match on the TV, that means he cares more about that than about your friendship. 
Same applies to dating someone: if they're not interested in going out with you, they're clearly expressing an opinion, a ""value judgment"" on you. You can avoid to take it personally in the sense that ""there's nothing wrong with you"", but still their decisions and reactions were definitely about you."
2,"Very good and creative, well done!"
1,I get that we should not take things personally but what I wonder is why people has to say mean things to anyone in the first place? Why can't people just be kind to each other and mind their own business ?

1,"Wow I genuinely enjoyed this one and the way he presented his lesson. He seems so genuine and I love his bubbly energy and how he tried to present a serious topic but made it fun at the same time. A huge contast in comparrison to me, this was an eye-opener because I realised how negative I am, I knew I was before but it really put things into perspective for me on how much negativity I give off and how I let my ego and hatred get in the way of everything, I hate it and I'm trying to change. I'll definitely be trying these techniques out props to him, I hope I succeed."

The people who are negative to us, isn't about us because it's more about who they are and what they are going through with their own personal life. so learned to be humble and train your mind into positive way. lots of accountabilities take place in this and facing your true realities that we need to change our way of thinking, seeing things and our mindset."

1,Love you sir. You spoke many people's mind.
2,Thank you so much. sweet but realistic
1,"Great talk! Excellent concepts. We need think greater than how we feel and not allow our feelings to become the means of thinking. The challenge is to teach the subconscious mind from reacting or at least to catch it quickly. Our evolution has been adaptive over the years - being aware of ""Worst Case Scenario"" kept us alive...predator might be outside cave. Now we tend to go to worst case to protect the psyche from some perceived threat. Real or imagined the chemicals created thru the stress response are the same and we get addicted to the rush. Fascinating stuff!"

1,"Such a sweet guy, hopefully all the people do understand its to become happy and not to take it personally ."
1,"But some things you have to take personally. There are moments, words, situations where you can’t see the situation from two sides of a coin because there is only one."
2,Absolutely loved this
1,"I'd want to put it the other way around: 1. It's about me: that'd give me a chance to reflect on my part that could have caused the person to behave a certain way. I'd go and explain my true intentions, admit if I had done something wrong. If the other person still keeps on holding their ground, time to move to the next phase: 2) It's not about me: just ignore and, perhaps stay away. I'd know that at least I tried to work things out and have right to feel guilt free."
1,"This is like my 10th time watching this video. Honestly, one of my most favorite TedTalk cuz it helps me remember that True Love is about being patient and working hard in wanting what is best for the other person, and not just selfishly wanting to keep the good feelings with that person. When we get bad feelings from a person, we can always take it personally and forget that we need to love them. This guy is honestly a legend for sacrificing his money income and his job just to learn how to not take things personally. And his voice is really nice and gentle and it motivates me to be the same when I grow up :) I share this with a lot of my friends too, and honestly, they probably won't watch it cuz they will take it personally but I always remember that it isn't about me. I send them that video cuz I care for them. And if they hate me then that's fine. I just don't want personal hate for their friends at least. Even Jesus was hated by an entire empire for his act of True Love. But he never took it personally because he knew that his value as a God-Given person can never be knocked down by hate. I believe that everyone's inner holy spirit can have a beautiful masterpiece where they can selflessly serve each other cuz of love."
1,Really grt and useful video for real life..super sir..folded_handsfolded_hands
1,a powerful video i come back to once again because this needs to be constantly reminded hundred_points
1,"The saying goes: ""You can't stop the waves, but you can learn to surf.""
You can't control what happens to you (how you perceive people to be mean to you) - 
but you can control how you react to it (by not taking it personally). 

Easier said than done - as it takes tremendous self control to be the best version of yourself. 

But, right at the end is the key here. The Speaker gives a very good insightful tip - ""keep your value, no matter what anyone does or whatever happens to you"" - ""because it's still 20 euros""."

1,Ik I can’t take criticism or constructive criticism I get offended fast and yes ima go off on you even if you are trying to help me I just don’t like it and never will
1,This is now one of my favorite TED talks! He was so engaging with the audience (tough crowd though). Youtube recommended it at such a specific time that I almost took it personally. Needed this!
1,"This was an excellent speech, and I really like your gestures and body language Frederik!"
1,At first I thought Billy in the street dyed his hair
1,Michael Jordan should watch
1,"It's a very good presentation. It's very hard to not to take things personally though, but I do agree that with what he said. This also applies when you feel embarrassed, and truth is: nobody cares...it's just you that feel embarrassed. Dropping the ego is the key, which is so damn hard, what a useless feature we developed."
1,"That finale was incredible. If you aren't able to understand that message, watch it again. Sometimes the easiest message needs to be repeated. There's no shame in that."

1,Such a non-judgmental way to think about yourself.  We are all human and our ego is a part of us.  Getting a perspective on that gives us power over ourselves.  Thank you!
2,Great lesson. Love it smiling_facered_heart

1,"Anyone else not taking these TED talks all that seriously anymore when just over there ---------->
in the up next section is at least 4 other TED talks videos literally contradicting this point to the letter?"
1,"In a similar class I once learned,  "" You will find out what your intentions are by the results you end up with,"" or ""Results=Intentions."" For example,  you say you want a happy marriage but you also know you are right about putting the cap back on the milk when put it back into the fridge.  You harp about it every time your spouse doesn't do it because you know ""you are right""about this. Result=disharmony in marriage=your intention, even though you said you intended to have a happy marriage,  what you really wanted was ""to be right"" about the milk container."
2,Really good and inspiring ...thanks for this video

It is not always about ""me, myself, and I"". shift your focus from ME to WE. our brain produces 50 000 thoughts. 80 percent of what we think are negative. It takes a lot of effort and discipline for us to re-shape our thoughts 2) ironically, this is about me at the end(my insecurity) because you are in self doubt when you are taking others personally. There are chances that this feeling is rooted in your childhood. Give yourself empathy to embrace yourself. 3) Speak up for yourself. Tell others what you feel (without blaming others)"

How can you not take that personal, she is lying in your face, she also could tell the truth and said she already have plans that day. your value will not be the same if you believe others lies and accept that"

1,"I've been practicing this value for a while now of not taking things personally and a second order effect it's had is that I can help ease others who seem upset or down in their own lives by sharing this same strategy and explaining that they've done nothing wrong necessarily, that there's likely a reason not related to you personally for the other person's actions or situation that made you upset."

1,"I just realized I am one of those who take things too personally. I think this habit has been with me since childhood. I remember one time, maybe I was around 6, I was traveling with a few people out of town and suddenly the tire of the vehicle punctured and we had to wait for a long time till the tire repaired. But at that time, I blamed myself and thought it was my fault and thanked other people didn’t know that lol. Maybe this habit is still with me. So, I will remember these two strategies from now on and try to fix it. Thank you, Sir!"

PS: It's a great talk and he is a wonderful speaker!"
1,"*Summary: *
Whenever you are talking to someone if the person walks away many people will take that personally and feel hurt. It hurts our ego. The speaker gives two strategies to not take things personally:
	1) It isn't about me: If a speaker is hurt by someone using a smartphone during the presentation, then it might not be about him- the topic might not interest the listener or he might have received an important text or he might be taking notes. When a child is denied something and wails and says 'I hate you', we don't take it personally because we know that it is the child's anger speaking. Look at the other person's intention. Seeing the positive intention of the other person takes lot of effort. But this strategy doesn't always work and that's when
	2) It is about me: It is about your insecurities. When you are being criticized and you are hurt chances are that it is rooted in your childhood. Give yourself empathy. Speak up for yourself. By opening up without blaming them will increase the chances of them accommodating your needs.
	
People may attack you but you must remember that you will always keep your value. Speaker also appeals to the audience to take thing personally for the next few days and then test out these strategies."

1,"I don't know, he's just using his job as an example of how he doesn't take things personally. Let's say if someone makes a personal attack against one of his parents? What confuses me is we all experience anger, so when I feel anger, the other person says I take it personally like it's a bad thing. Some stuff we are passionate about. Some people have said stuff about me and it didn't faze me. I think if we value a person more than we take it personally"

1,Amazing information... I will put this in practice. Thanks sir and TEDx!
1,I can answer this without watching it. The trick is to not give a damn.
1,I personally say that what he said was obviously about merose
1,In my point of view. It's not purely based on ego. Ego can be actually useful without letting it out. It's the Inner-ego that helps you build walls around your self-esteem and self-worth. It also neglects doubt and anxiety.

But I know I had a good childhood, and I’m just confused where my roots came from to make me feel this way. Definitely a good video though! Really happy I came across it and I hope to implement these strategies in my life."

1,"The feels of responsibility sometimes won't let you let it be. Let's say as a teacher, most of the time, you need to take it personally when seeing your students struggling with your lessons. But I do agree that it's still your choice to let your ego go up front of step back, whatever make things work and make you smile eventually. Love"
0,Some of the comments in here are sending me into a rage.
1,"People may attack you, criticise you, ignore you, crumble you with their words, spit you out or even walk all over you... but whatever they say or do.....you will still have your value! clapping_handsclapping_hands"
1,"I would like to provide a slight counter to this philosophy (which is great, just with some caveats) - you need to learn, as the speaker said A) to understand it's not about you much of the time, B) sometimes it is a little bit about you but that's still alright....and the caveat, C) don't go down the path of constantly trying to please other people.  With A, you can become oblivious and deluded, thinking you're always right and the other person has issues, but with B you can go to the other extreme by constantly rationalising why the other person is right, and if you just ""fixed yourself"" THEN you will be likable and have value.  One must realise that this game of life is a slow evolutionary process, not something you correct overnight, and oftentimes, not something you directly tackle....it usually must happen through experience, an organic/natural process of passing time and circumstances.  Ironically, if you want to stop feeling hurt/sad because you take things personally, the other extreme of over-introspection can have the same effect - making you feel not good enough!  Sometimes in life you just need to chill, hang out with people you love, and many of these hang-ups iron themselves out over the years  :)"
1,YouTube recommend me this video and i take it personally slightly_smiling_face
1,"That was a fascinating moralistic presentation 
I don't take it personally"
1,i like his dress code. i am going to get the clothes like he is wearing
1,When some one ask you why are you upset and you start telling them and they start looking here and there and in smartphone it is natural to take it personally. The best way not to take this personally is when they are upset approach them with a lot empathy and when they start talking open you smart phone and start enjoying some tik tok videos and start laughing and lets see how they feel face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy. Behave with then the same way they behave with you do it and you will see reality of peoples. Don't take on yourself the burden of being morally correct you are not special in 7 billion people and neither is other person.
1,its so awesome that everyone i try to talk to starts taking notes of me on their phone
2,This audience has no sense of humour or chill.
1,Conning more and more people by spreading not to take things personally and of course what the best other way to do so
1,"I have friends to tell me to stop taking stuff personally when they insult me as a “joke”. Problem is, it’s all the time, and they continue to do it even more when I’m not in the mood and I ask them to stop. do you guys think that my issue is I take it too personally or is it valid to be upset at them violating the boundaries so flagrantly in blatantly? For more context, they also pick on my insecurities. Ive tried to talk to them about it but they always make excuses."
1,There is no other one

2,Great public speaker! Chapeau!
2,Yep. It should be easier if you own the whistle.
1,"Such an insightful message from the speaker to sensitive people, which conveys two strategies how to overcome this strange feeling that everyone is familiar with. Personally I decided for myself do not take the things personally because it’s waste of time, energy and mood; with all this leaving a choice for myself to self-reflect or not. Unexpectedly, I realized that I have been adhering these tactics for a long time, that’s why this video is kind of reminder that I always keep value no matter what and no matter they say."
1,"What a person says or does to me force me to keep or kick that  person......
Your thoughts, actions tell everything to me which force me to set boundaries accordingly.
You are not me and I never want to be you.
The person who can understand me is me or God.
Freedom is essential for everyone but it's definition is different for everyone one."

1,"Q. How not to take things personally?
     Because now, here and now.
     I very conscious that this can happen.

Q.  Why do we take things personally?
-.    Our ego thinks that others should take us into
      consideration.
                      Our ego does not want to be criticized,
      Our ego acknowled that  'I am right' 
 
                    -  Two strategy - 
 1. It's not about me,  look at the other person's          
    intentions.
-  Because when I take things personally, 
    I am convinced it is about me. 
I simply need shift my focus for ""Me"" to ""We”. 

2. It's about Me, Give yourself  empathy , and speak up.
- We can take things personally 
    If it somehow touches  raw nerve.

        ""Peoples make attack you.
        criticize you or ignore you. ""
   -- You will always keep your value. --"

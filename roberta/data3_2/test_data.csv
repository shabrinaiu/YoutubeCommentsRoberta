1,Interesting motivational speech but I didn't like the fact that you put the money in your mouth.
1,Wow! I didn't expect such a dramatic ending! Quite an absorbing and passionate presentation on simple mantra of life. Well done Frederik!
1,Very informative! Emotional training should be a part of parenting and school/college curriculum.
2,"I wish he was my friend, what a cutie"
1,"What about when you are not dealing with a crowd? What about a personal relationship that you are constantly put down in, does it mean the other person has issues and I still should take nothing personally?"
1,when I say you are an orange. who would take it personally . no one right ! why not ? because nothing in you believes that you are in fact  an orange! an orange? unless of course that you are ginger.... and you feel bad because of that!!!!  - Frederik (makes me to laugh out loud haha. made my day....)!
1,"Money is an issue that everyone has for a better and luxurious life, Life was hard for me until I started trading bitcoin and am now earning $18,435 per week."
2,"Obvious INFP, barely enlightened"
1,I understand the premise but to be honest: there is a difference if a friend doesn’t want to see you and when you take criticism for a project at work... there is a spectrum of what you consider personal
1,He isn't even in front of an audience
1,"""You are telling someone about your day and they just go and turn on the tv"" <--- I would fucking get pissed off if someone acted so rude and just leave in the middle of me speaking, without a word."
1,What if your brother and sister n law tell you you’re only allowed at our vacation home if we’re there. Your brother then gets a call from your sister n law’s brother and your brother says so did you have a great time in Sanibel did you like your stay at our vacation home. Were you comfortable. Then her entire family is always invited to stay at their Florida house. You see pics of them in their pool having a great time but I was never invited or offered to stay. They had the home for over 3yrs. Should I take that personally?
0,Turns out young Harold was not hiding His pain all along
1,"Whilst I agree with the concept of what Mr. Federik Imbo discusses, I disagree with the reframing of discussion to be positive.  In his example of colleagues talking then laughing when seeing you, realistically, they may be talking about you, therefore the disagreement in the positive reframing of mind.  However, in saying this, I agree with the concept of not taking this personally.  The colleagues laughing at you says everything about them and who they are and nothing about you or who you are.  It stems from their personal insecurities.  
An expansion on his concept is, through overcoming your own insecurities, you are able to overcome taking things personally.  This is because your insecurities are directly linked to what you would and would not take personally - i.e., his reference to ""...you are an orange""."
2,Thanks a lot! red_heartfolded_hands
1,Is he canadian.?
1,"Another perspective is how not to take things personally when you are wrong or you indeed made a mistake.
Because many people will shout to you pretty bad (it's their intention anyway) but there is a certain point that you can't afford raw blaming.
It takes so much time and effort to learn how to control yourself."

1,Frederik should teach Michael Jordan a thing or two
1,"dont take ""it"" personally = you can simply do this through a couple of easy thoughts - once you are aware of them they become second nature - it will stop you being offended at things people say & do. People will be people after all, and just like you and me, we are all fallible - so - 
1. - losing your self importance is key.
2. - dont have a position to defend.
 - given these two choices you will gravitate towards truth & kindness anyway because you dont have any ego to maintain, which is draining. If you find that you are doing or saying things that seem to make little sense, just ask yourself if this is you ego - your self-importance - talking."

Good on you ginger bro being called a orange as a kid does have some kind of hurt behind it because of the intention that is intended by others when using this word it's a form a racism.

I was listening from the background and multi tasking many other pages when finally came back and with 100% off attention i began to watch the presentation, the moment was when you told how many negative thoughts we all have in my mind, i was never consciousness until this moment. You as a referee can totally understand the feeling when you ignored, shouted, cheated, blamed etc.
because of this you were totally authentic. The last part was ""3 Aces"" example with the 20 euro.

              1. It's not about me.
                     Look at the other person's intention.
               2. It is about me.
                    Give yourself empathy and speak up,
              3. You will always keep your value.

Decide what to do first and finally, the world is very short compared to the days of God, so do not lose it while you are not right."
1,"he's conflating self respect with ego. it's correct to take something personally if someone you personally know is disrespecting you. that's not the same as ""blaming"" them or saying it's ""their fault"" you feel a way. feeling disrespected/hurt/angry is a defense mechanism to protect you from mistreatment."

1,"I loved this ted talk and I was really enchanted by the last message, but then I started thinking, Inflation! The 20 Euros becomes less and less worthy, because of how the market goes. Same applies to us. We can have our value, but at the world is moving in, it decreases over time unless we work on increasing it! Having a college degree in marketing doesn't do the same now as it did 10 years ago.  I feel like 'Value' is a percpective. 20 Euros would do a lot in Vietnam, but not in Germany. We should know where our value is appreciated!"

1,"I hope we realize this now, better than ever, when we are pushed into facing our true selves in social isolation: Our life is too short and precious to spend it in the vain effort of receiving other people's ephemeral validation and recognition. There is no pragmatism in thinking that you will ever be able to constantly satisfy all those that you try to. If you cannot recognize your own value YOURSELF, you will never be happy, no matter how others see you. Our greatest gift as human beings is our freedom. It is the only purpose that we should fight for in this life: the freedom of mind and soul. And it is by investing in our inner values that this goal can be achieved. There is no freedom in compromising who you are for the sake of being regarded as you wish you were. That will make you feel miserable when this show called life comes to an end. 
P.S.: These thoughts result from Christian faith, i.e. that faith that society mocks and tries to keep us away from, because society does not want us to feel free and equally valuable, but to depend on its exploitative validation. Live every day as if it were your last, because one day it will be. And love all those who appreciate your true self. They are the only ones who deserve your inborn value."

1,"All those people in comments saying that they took it personally, should really watch the video and not take it personally."
1,20 Euro per match? WHAAT?
1,They do think you are worthless despite your faux positivism. Take it personally.
1,Thank you for this TED Talks. This video really hits me. I love this and all the other videos. star-strucksmiling_face_with_heart-eyes

 We are going to watch this with our kids. This is a great personal power to develop and as a family we have a culture of 'offendedness' to overcome.  Perfect timing to see your presentation.  Thank you for sharing your wise words."
1,"About ""The Light"": 
 "" ""I,"" was created by the thought of Gods and ""Their,"" desire to allow all mortals to know that ""They,"" are always with them: As humankind grows and seeks absolute independence from ""Them,"" ""They,"" will remain by their side, guiding them and directing them, in their growth to absolute ""WISDOM,"" the way to ""Their Essence"" and the Elysium Fields. As you look out beyond the now, into the heavens, ""I"" will be there, guiding you and helping you know that ""I,"" be visible or invisible, ""My Essence,"" will guide you beyond all that is sensed in your reality. So, let it be now revealed to you that both ""I"" and ""He,"" in mortal being, who speaks to you through the thoughts of children are but one. "" Eleusis.     Let The Light within you guide you to the Elysian Fields entrance; your inner beauty is expected. Follow me, ""Imagination is the way."" by ELias Leousis."

The way you speak is very persuasive and reflective. This has helped me a lot, I am practicing and teaching myself every day with this, as I have always taken things personally.  Even I have been working since my childhood where I started to develop this.  I would very much like to see other tips from you sticking to this kind of explanation.

1,"Was a bit skeptical until he said the last bit. That got me tearing up unexpectedly. I'm good at dealing with criticism when there's no truth in it it but it's hard when it's something you're not very strong in and you know it. And it's especially hard when (as he touched on) you've been raised in a critical environment, where you are not only constantly criticized but also told that because you make mistakes or struggle that you are worth less as a person. You can't stop the unreasonable critics but this goes a long way towards helping heal the part that thinks it makes me worthless. Thank you Frederik."

1,"Am I the only one seeing two nuances with this title?
The first one is obvious but in another sense, it could also be interpreted as ""if you want to take things personally here are the no-no's that you should avoid"" as if there's a correct or better way to take things personally. lmao
Maybe it would be less confusing if it was ""How to not take things personally?"""

1,"Opening up to others don't make others to understand, in-fact many times opening to others exposes vulnerability and others take advantage of that. Even trusted one also can change as its human nature. Its all your personal values. Many like chattering about your issues to others and at the end it makes you feel guilty. Its always important to find right person who can understand. It breaks the soul if that known person only breaks your trust. Always try to identify your personality. If u r highly sensitive, keep yourself away from negativity as it wont cost anything to others but you will loose urself. Do what you like and just ignore the rest."

1,"Today is my birthday and because of the pandemic I am not able to celebrate my birthday with friends and family. Usually, I would plan something in advance and I would go out with all of them to have a nice dinner. But this year, I haven't been in touch with them so much and I haven't communicated my plans in advance (to remind them of my birthday) beacause I couldn't make a birhday party this year. And to my surprize, a lot less people wished me happy birthday this year. Just my very best friends and close family members reached to me. I took it very personally. I did not expected this. But then I tried thinking that it is my birthday and I have to enjoy it, and that enjoyment needs to come from myself and not be something that I have to receive from others. (Tge apreciation from others should be just a bonus and nothing more) And then this video poped up and I feel a little better now. So, for whoever is reading this, don't take things personally. Take care of yourself"

I want to learn how to stop taking these things personally and stop feeling like I have to convince these people that their views on my people are wrong."
1,"So you mean
If you have clarity of what you want in life and are righteous about what you want then you are very sorted as a personality and you are confident of your selfworth
What ever people tell is just reflecting on to what they want
Suppose some one bullies you they are doing to win other peoples attention coz all the want is to feel good and better above all and this is a way for them to do it
But dont you think not taking it personally will judt drop the perception of your worth in others eyes as well?
Yes you still value yourself in your own eyes irrespective of what people day or do but you live in a society which is judgemental snd you want to lead a respectable and dignified life
Ofcourse respect in other oersons eyes is always on whst they wsnt and not personally you
But still what you want and what others want sometimes coniside and that's what makes people take personally
If you start not taking anything perosnally, dosent it make you saturated and arrogant??
Saturated as in not taking constructive criticism??
Arrogant as in not listening to others coz some times its also about listening and satisfying others needs"
1,"Believe it or not, I watched this video last night (as of me posting this comment) and after going to sleep, I *dreamed* about a scenario where I ended up thinking about both of the strategies in this video! 

I was talking with someone and began to give a very long response to a question they asked and then at some point they interrupted me and said I was taking too long to get to the point. I initially felt bad, but then I suddenly remembered ""it's not about me, it's about we"" and thought to myself ""perhaps the person just doesn't want their time to be wasted or can't focus on what I'm trying to say with extraneous words sprinkled around. Then I thought about the other side (the ""it's about me"" one) and told myself that it's okay, but next time I should work on explaining things concisely. After that, I kinda seemed to change the topic before waking up and realizing ""oh my gosh, did I just practice Frederik's strategies in my dreams?""

1,"Frederik,
Thank you for taking the time to share the two sides of this coin with us, with me especially. I grew up in a very demanding household. Even though we were children if we were told to do some chore or such, and we had a daily list, we were expected to do them to the same degree of completeness as when we were shown how to do them. Then our work was inspected before we could be excused to go play, or in some cases, return to our room to continue our “grounding” for some other infringement. My younger brother developed an “I just don’t care” attitude. As the eldest I feared for him and would redo his work and check mine repeatedly while awaiting the “white glove inspection” or the “bounce a coin off the sheet” test by our father. Passing was a great relief, but if I one of us failed we were both held responsible. This, among other quirks in my upbringing, left me setting expectations for myself and others that could not be met. It left me in a permanent state of being disappointed in myself and my co-workers, and eventually my employees. Professionally, I got lucky when a new manager came in and saw in me something of value and became my mentor for many years. The best thing he gave me was advice about setting expectations for others. He said these should be based on an honest assessment of each person’s capabilities, not on what I felt I could do. He impressed on me the need to set appropriate expectations for my employees do that they could meet them if they stretched themselves a little bit; thus with each assignment they could grow and feel good about themselves. We can’t all be held to the same level of performance on every task. But we can’t be allowed to skate by doing less than we are able either.

Implicit in that advice, which I took to heart at work, was the need to do the same for my self, my new family (a lovely wife and then a son), as well as my friends. Somehow I missed that implication, though I eventually put two and two together, but it’s 30 years later and I can see the damage done.

Not that this was my only personal problem, lol, but it still bites me in the a$$ now. I take almost everything bad personally at first. In some causes I can sort of stop and think it over and let it go when it is clearly not my fault, but feeling responsible for all the bad things that have happened to those I love or have loved is still my first reaction. And feeling responsible for me means it must be my fault which must be taken personally or how can I show that I take someone’s upset with me seriously? How can I apologize in a way that they will know I mean it? And perhaps let me try to fix it or make it up to them? And if they won’t let me make it up to them then that just proves that I wasn’t worth the trust in the first place...

So, I’m sure you can see how hearing you this morning, 2020/03/07- central time, Houston, TX, struck such a deep chord. I’ve taken everything personally since I was a child regardless of it being something deserving of reflection and remediation or it actually being someone else’s problem. The deepest truth in what you had to say was that, without our permission, there is no one nor any thing that can MAKE us feel bad about ourselves. But for those of us who got swindle out of that information at an early age and now have difficulty re-integrating that basic truth as a pre-filter to interpreting the world around us, reminders in passionate talks like this one, are a requisite, a daily prescription, lest we forget and get sucked back into the morass that was my emotional life for so many years regardless of the loving, well meaning people around me who tried so hard to help me. Only in the last couple of years have I been willing to “take my medicine” and try to face the things that come up in life with this kind of knowledge do as to maintain what’s left of my sanity, my well-being, my happiness. 

Thank you for putting yourself out there and sharing this. I think the idea to thrust yourself into such a harsh place to resolve “taking things personally” is an amazing (though unthinkable) idea. You are obviously brave and innovative. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2,Such a valuable talk. Thank you.
1,"(Summary?)
taking his example of the project sharing, where A shares his project to B, but B goes on his smartphone
We should consider all the **possible** intentions of B when he looks at his smartphone:

B wants to take notes about your project, and/or
B wants to check if she/he recieved an important email
(etc...)
**B wants to show you that he/she doesn't care about your project**

There are so many possibilities! but, we often decide to believe that last one, because of our ego. Though, it can be that first one, or that second one, or both, or etc.

So, before thinking anything, we need to first comprehend the true intention of the other person, and not comprehend what we think his/her intention is.

(as showed in the video,   -""Look at the other person's intention first"")


Another example is: Why is nobody laughing at the presentator's jokes?
it might be because his jokes are not funny
it might be because his presentation is boring
[...]
**it might be they are concentrated on his presentation**

There are solutions to spot out the other person's true intention:
Tell the other person how you are feeling after hearing her/his words basing on the intention you believe they have, and they will probably tell you their real intention if the intention you believe is wrong (try do this without accusing the other)

And if the other doesn't seem to care about your feelings, then let's ask them directly: ""What's your intention?""

Have a good day : )"

1,Thankfully Michael Jordan did not see this.
1,who is here before 6 million views?
1,This is the public speaking skills I needed in my life. He really grabbed my attention the whole talk.
1,"I needed this. I like that he acknowledges being vulnerable and speaking up in hurtful situations - too many people, including myself, would keep silent and let resentment fester to ""keep peace"" when it is actually the opposite. It is because I have been threatened and told that I take things too personally simply for acknowledging my humanity when it's violated, no matter how graciously it is handled. Whether or not someone values me as an equal human being means nothing to the truth of being one.

Taking things personally means internalizing someone else's action and taking blame for it by lashing out in anger or indifference. Giving one the benefit of the doubt must be balanced with knowing the other person and using intuition to gauge that person's intentions and using discernment in whether the relationship is worth the effort or if it's more appropriate to ignore and walk away from a narcissist. 

We cannot control nor demand others' actions yet we can control and command how those actions affect us, what we will accept and put our own peace first. Please don't mistake his message for accepting anything and everything and tolerating abuse; rather, it is about not giving our God-given power away and owning our own self-worth. folded_hands"

1,"Love this green_heart “no matter what people do or say, you will always keep your value.”"
1,"There is a 3rd part to this equation, the one where our ego plays a role instinctively to protect ourselves. This is the natural part we want to change, but in some cases our ego is right. For example, someone is really attacking you out of spite & intentionally is trying to hurt you. They want you to show vulnerability not for them to feel empathetic, but to feel superior. It's really tricky figuring out which is which.

1. It's not about me. The other person is doing this because of him/her own issues

2. It is about me. And something that Im aware of and I too dont like about me. I need to change/they need to know im affected by it and its ok to be vulnerable with them

3. This person intends harm towards me. I must protect myself and not show any weakness. They are the problem and I do take their disrespect personally."

1,"Thank you so much for sharing this wisdom, Frederick. We are all vulnerable, but do not take it personally, it's not about me (understanding others and focus on your goal) it's about me (because of ego, want recognisation and encouragement from people surrounded you, when it hurts give yourself empathy ), speak up, tell people what you feel by saying things itself, not blaming or arguing. The ending of Euro 20 is a  highlight. I played this video twice, the first time i was just listening, but didn't get the point, but the second time i was watching the video and finally a light came into my mind when Frederick picked up the crumbled note from the ground and opened up, saying don't forget, it's still 20euro, its value hasn't been changed..."

1,"WRONG advice. Currency notes maintain their value because power of governments provide them support.
Wildlife, war, stock market & sports are zero sum (win-lose) games/ situations, outside the realm of civilized society. Their paradigms should never be applied on norms of civilized society.
Civilized society thrives on win-win situations. Therefore, each time you take any bs, abuse or nonsense, you diminish your self-esteem. 
Referees, like currency notes, have solid support of the 'system', therefore, they must not be allowed to serve as an example of day-to-day life.
People who irritate you, attack you or belittle you 
and all such & all those.

1,"I learned at 15 years old that when people say things about you - it’s their perception of you woman_shrugging. When people say things to you, it is also about perception. If you are confident, emotionally intelligent, and have a sense of humor to translate sarcasm, you are not easily offended/don’t take things personally. 

When you tell someone that you are offended/took something personally, please evaluate the situation...did you really take it personally or are you trying manipulate them to get your way?"

I use to give people an OUT by pretending that they were just naive about the power contained in encouragement! But as the years have passed, I’ve realized that I was the NAIVE ONE. The reality is that on a conscious or subconscious level most people harbor ILL WILL towards others that may surpass them in some way!

1,The problem with not taking things personally is that everything becomes impersonal...
1,"Thank you Frederik. I stopped taking interviews or any rejection personally years ago, I realized that a rejection is not a reflection of who I am but it simply means that my current skills, or personality are not what the interviewer or other person wants. I also hold onto Romans  which says that, ""All things work together for the good of those who love God, those who have been called according to His purpose.""

1,"The fact is, Cryptocurrency is making financial waves and fighting against poverty in this modern era, and the question traders as them self is if this the right time to invest ?
Before jumping into conclusion I think you should take a look at things first. For the past few days the price of Bitcoin has been fluctuating which means the Market is currently unstable and you can't tell if it is going bearish or bullish. While others Still continue to trade without the fear of making loss, others are been patient. It all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signal. I would say trading has been going smoothly for me , I started with 1.5 BTC and I have accumulated over 6.7BTC within 3 weeks with the trading strategies given to me by Expert Blian Reinkensmeyer His method are top notch and profitable, obviously he's the best.

0,This hits hard when you feel bad about yourself
1,"Really great talk until his second strategy, which kind of negates the first. ""It's about me"" seems to conflate taking something personally with just knowing something is your fault, so it's like he's actually endorsing taking things personally. Even in his example of how to ""speak up"", the guy is clearly taking it personally."

1,"A couple of points about this: 
1. It's easy to disassociate that way if it's with a third party. (Like the refereeing. Or my customer facing job). You can understand where they're coming from and accommodate. ""It's not me"". But should you *have* to do that with family? Isn't being ""personally"" affected by someone's actions what makes them 'family' in the loosest sense?
2. There is a distinction between understand and accepting. You *understand* why your spouse got up to turn on the TV when you're mid-rant about how you're feeling low. But would you want to *accept* and be okay with the fact that your spouse isn't being supportive? (If it happens repeatedly)"

1,i don't there is an audience.. i think the place is empty.. who is he talking to?
1,"Basically:
Be less insecure: By knowing your weaknesses you need to work on, and your strengths you can feel confident about.
Be more empathetic: By listening to what the other wants, why are they saying that.
Be more vulnerable: Speak up. Say what's on your mind.
All in all, just be a better human being. Being paranoid means being insecure. Fighting paranoia is just covering the symptoms not the cause.

All this is pretty standard stuff if you're acquainted with Jordan Peterson."

And all that stuff even today i still think that like when my parents get angry at me, when i don't even know what happened in there day they could have had a terrible day at work or something. So never blame yourself for a best friend moving away because they might not have a choice it might be there parents choice and never blame yourself when your parents are angry because u never know how there day was they could of had a rough day and that even goes with friends if there mad at u don't blame yourself they could have had a bad day today too. :)

1,Stop trying to seek validation from people that don’t f wit you
1,First thing people must know is that there is a true statement says everything happens for a reason and for that reason we should not take things personally.. If you have to fight for it it does not meant for you because what is for you will be for you regardless. Second thing I would say is all people are not emotional or looks people the way you do so you cant internationalize the way you feel because Humans are not all the same feelings because sometimes a bad thing can be a good thing for you or good thing can be bad but either way we should not be always on alert on what people do or say.. because only that will make  unwanted silly never ending conflicts and always saying WHYYYYY....

I like the ending where Frederick explains we can become vulnerable and say 'excuse me, but when you do that it feels as if you don't care about my story,' Don't make it personal, don't blame."
2,I like your conversation
1,the irony is that I sent this video to someone and they took it personally
1,"The guy is amazing , but the audience in here sucks"
2,Superb Sir....It's worth watching by everyone .
1,"I was taught ""Sticks and stones may break my bones but words can never hurt me.""

My granddaughter's teacher had a sign on the door where the last line had been changed to ""...but words can hurt forever.""

In other words, kids are now taught to make every insult last for as long as they can or until someone else offends you even more deeply.

At 66 I might not be around long enough to see the end results of our current cancel culture where it seems everyone takes everything personally,

But then again, maybe The End is just around the corner, as the prognosticators of doom have been predicting for millenia.

In any case, all I can say to the proponents of the notion that no one should ever contradict anyone and thereby run the risk of hurting their feelings is ""Good luck with that."""

I'm qualified in training and assessment myself and felt although the assessment was correct, it was not delivered in a fair manner. I have taken it all personally. This has helped me deal with it on a day when I'm considering giving the coaching with this organisation away, which would mean letting down twenty young players and their parents. I'm very glad I came along this presentation at exactly the right time."

2,Such a good explanation slightly_smiling_face
1,"The speaker put in some fine efforts in narrating a visually appealing story on tolerance. It may help in thinking wisely to avoid small bothering to ownself, in daily life. Though, I feel that this content was quite generic to the extent that if I am looking to apply those ways to feel better, I may only get a hollow sense of well-being.

I don't intend to belittle the wisdom shared here, but this is quite iterative on lines of done-to-death stereotypical ideologies about feel-good ways.

Maybe, in the coming videos the speaker could some of the other techniques that are useful in tackling or reengineering the ways we think about such matters."

2,"I tried sharing this video with a friend, but they took it personally..."
1,"This is good food for thought. I've come to learn that many times when people are downing you, they are actually deflecting/projecting and it's all about them. For example, if people feel you're a better parent than them, some of them will gossip about YOU instead of focusing on themselves. Also, during a smear campaign, the audience invariably believes the offender and not the person being slandered. It's hard not to take that personally but the truth is, again, it has nothing to do with you since they are unsuspecting victims of the manipulator."
1,You got into great shape since the pic was taken on the pitch
0,YouTube recommended me this. I feel personally attack.
1,I have an overwhelming suspicion that there is not an actual audience lol.  The one guys voice from the audience sounds like the same one. Or maybe there's only one person in the audience.

1,"Man, that first example was a horrible one considering the points he's trying to make. If you are inviting someone to go to the movies and they decline, claiming they have to work and then go to dinner with other friends, that is something you should definitely take personally. There's no ""oh maybe it's because of this thing or that"". They have lied to you instead of just telling the truth and saying they had other plans. If you don't take that personally something is very wrong with you because that is pretty much the definition of someone doing something against you personally. The same goes for the ""looking at you and then laughing"" example."

1,"how not to be the scapegoat/takes things personally > people feel betrayed and blame the other person -> ask who is speaking > our ego doesn't want to be criticized > we want to be right > wanting to be right versus wanting to be happy.  Two strategies for no longer taking things personally: 1) it's not about me,  look at from another's perspective/intention, shift focus from me to we (too many negative thoughts in the day); 2) it is about me (when it's not about me), when you have inner insecurities you need to deal with, you also need to question yourself, are things rooted in your childhood and it touches a raw nerve. THEN give yourself some empathy"

2,The last comparison was powerful. love it
1,"What about someone who's making life very difficult for everyone around him/her? Instead of changing his/her attitude, that cocky person thinks ""it's not because of me that they're having all the trouble"". So that person continue to tear you n your family for over 7 years, do I still say ""it's not about me"" and keep getting pushed?? And does that person still thinks ""it's not about me"" and so it's ok to keep up with this behaviour? What if the other person is really determined to hate you for life no matter what you do for them? Sometimes self introspection is required.."
1,"It took me many years to walk through life positive. However I’m having great difficulty when I take  responsibility , apologize, go above & beyond to correct and do so kindly but still so many a -holes view my kindness as weakness and they respond rudely.

1,Powerful strategies that can apply to all ages. I will definitely share this with my middle schoolers.
1,"Hi Frederik, I really enjoyed your talk, particularly the fact that you have a sincere intention of making the world a better place. 

I believe that one of the reasons that we humans take things personally is that it is part of our defense mechanism to fix something that can be potentially wrong with us, because ultimately we fear of dying (example: something wrong with us = bad performance at work = no money = no food = death), and we would want to do anything to survive. It is the fear of letting go of the chance to identify something can be wrong with us, that makes it so difficult to not take things personally.

What are your thoughts?"
2,Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! So clear and useful :)

1,"His presentation  and slide share would have been a little  different  had  he got tails , So , did he really got heads when he flipped the coin , or was it part of the act."
1,"Perhaps, it is not always possible. A war and the sacrifice are two things that can't be not taken personally. I mean the sacrifice of Jesus Christ Gd on the cross as well as the war against the army of Satan described in the Book of Revelation. All of them are true and impact the politics and our daily lives. We can't ignore them. If we deny the divine order to take things personally, we omit to incarnate Jesus Christ God in our flesh and to work to live and become like Him.
Not to be a person is not to follow Christ. And definitely not to be saved."

Not sure i agree its all rooted in childhood but yeah the point about some part of you believing the sleights made against you was a revelation. I studied psychology but this is something new to me"

1,"everyone takes things personally that needn't be taken personally. an acquaintance of mine is taking literally everything personally. it was so trying when we frequently saw each other. (my therapist even told me to break contact with her bc she does not do me good. luckily she moved away and is busy with life now, so i did not need to be so drastic. i do like her and wish her the best.) 

but i take a lot personally i would not need to, just as everyone else does. so i will try to think about this more. even in situations i wouldn't normally."
1,"- Someone, who doesnt take things personally: Someone, who doesnt care at all, maybe a psychopath.
- Someone, who takes all things personally: An egocentric believer in social rights and social/emotional intelligence.
- Healthy/firm person (or generally born before 2000): Probably doesnt need to be told, what to take personally and what not.

Frederik Imbo gets other words and things wrong also:
- Taking things personally is not the same as considering things important! The guy  in the car behind yours is addressing specifically you, so its correct to take his angry message personally. But that doesnt mean one should consider this message or him to be of importance.
Same goes for most of the other examples he tells. Most of them are examples of things, which ought to be taken personally simply because they are and wouldnt make any sense otherwise.
- Beeing right is not the same as insisting on beeing right! ""Do you want to be right?"" Well, dont you? And dont you want others to strive for that, too? Really? Isnt beeing right important and good? What about that referee-example and why should there be a referee, if he didnt care about the game to be played correctly? What if a pilot or a chirurg doesnt care about beeing right anymore? Who wants to be on that plane or under that scalpel? Does anyone really want to live in a society with a large proportion of people not acknowledging what is right?
- Also, he gives no explanation for his strange conclusion, that one can experience more harmony in the presence of people who dont give a f*ck about anything.
- Insisting on beeing right or in other words avoiding to even think of beeing wrong is a matter of the ego as is going on stage and acting or giving a presentation like this.
Its totally ok to feed the ego for beeing right as long as one cares to be right in the first place."

You will still be stuck by the same question in your head. Is it me or not? And THAT'S exactly what drives a person crazy. So he proposes two strategies 1) It's about them 2) It's about me. What side do you think insecure people will go for? This presentation doesn't make sense and is harmful for mental health"

1,don`t take it personally red_heart
1,"I'm taking things personally all the time. I'm sensitive and overthink alot, that everything's my fault. It's so easy to explain that, yet for the whole time it was hard for me to figure it out. I don't have friends in my class and I never know when it's my fault or not, because everytime I do something wrong, I get critisized and yelled at by them, convincing me I hurt them, or in most cases, for example, ruined the game, when I did something wrong in P.E. while playing football. When I told my family about my problems, they keep telling me it's not about me, and I agree. But everytime I do something wrong and get critisized, it takes time to realize if I actually did something wrong or they're just complaining and I never know how to answer. I always get scared of doing or saying something wrong, so I stay quiet in class. This video is basically about everything that I'm having troubles with. I'm glad I watched it, but I also know these methods don't work at the first try. The fact that I'm sensitive, overthink and take things personally, they're all just part of my personality and it takes time and practice to make things easier. Also it'd be better for me in my situation to have a friend around who could support me at any time (i only have online friends and overall friends who aren't in my class). 
But overall thank you for this video. This means alot to me."
1,"Interesting. Most of the time it is not personal at ‘Me’. But there ARE times when it is personal. One has to recognize when that happens. Otherwise one will end up being gas-lit, and manipulated and sink. It can be about ME. It touches a raw nerve. It is PERSONAL then. When your partner walks away from your talking of your day, then “I don’t care about your story” is taken personally. You will always keep your value-but the comment was ‘taken personally’."

Taking things personally , is absolutely my weakness. And I’m hard on myself to try and become the perfect person. 
To have empathy for me as well, would be the strategy that might help , when I feel criticized, disrespected and unloved.
Bút as a referee, you are in a better position to set boundaries or give a red card. 
I don’t have this authority in my job.
But I have lots of opportunities to practice grimacing_face
It would be a great relief if I wouldn’t take things personally to heart and feel hurt so easily.

You dont understand how lucky you are to have a child who is very creative and who just wants some inspiration? Aren't u watching how excited i am about this place and u just ignore it?
Then, if I make a mistake like throwing an icecream I get mad bcs they give me those disapointed looks and then I am like : why is just anice cream and then very irrational thoughs come to me."

Being a trans person, ""not taking things personally"" is a Life Skill that I have reached the stage of unconscious-competence in; in other words, it has become my default, habitual response method. 
Amazingly, watching this video somehow validated what I was saying and exposed a layer of imposter syndrome. Funny how we teach what we most need to learn; I am grateful for you and for your TED talk my friend. Namaste'

1,"Wow, this ted talk was needed. Going through breakups in the past, i came to believe that i wasn't good enough. I took it personally if the other person didn't want me, now listening to this i held a self therapy session with myself and found that  i secretly didn't think i was good enough. Parts of me said i deserved being neglected because i'm not good enough to be kept or wanted. When i called myself a queen i secretly didn't believe it. It didn't resonate with my soul, i was just mouthing words. But a lot of self realization has come from this very simple message. Perhaps people leave because you are not what they want, they have a different taste, and that's totally normal and ok, but it doesn't make you undeserving or less than. We should all be allowed choices and you are not everyone's choice. Not everyone likes/buys Gucci, but it doesn't change the price of their products. Heck they won't even give a discount, if you don't like it keep it pushing. It used to be about you but once you dealt with your trauma and insecurities, it stopped being  about you. Thank you Frederik."

1,"They dont just want their team to win they want it to be a fair game so yes it IS about you to some degree. Its your responsibility to keep the game fair. Being able to not be right is the real game. You SHOULD question yourself otherwise you're being an egomaniac. So your example isnt quite right an you debunk it later. Surely the goal is to become someone who can accept criticism and to seperate your actions from your ego - isnt the problem that the ego is too conencted to the action? if you accept that as a ref you can and do make mistakes then surely when people question you can take it lightly... 
Otherwise great talk!"
1,what is value?
1,"Brilliant! Loved how you described ego taking everything personally, aligning unfortunate circumstances to our childhood wounds. That's why it's so important to heal our inner child, to validate our feelings and re-parent ourselves because we're only hurtful when we think we're worthless and not valuable, which is absolutely not true. Love and light to allred_heart"
1,I like the presenter in this one. He sounds quite humble and passionate about the message he's delivering.
1,If I have to chose then I would rather be right then agreeing on others blindly and suprressing own even if we have all the valid reasons for our decision. Happiness is an illusion anyway bcz happiness comes with expectations which is ultimate sorrow.

1.Its not about me - try to see other person's intention
2.If its about me - show yourself some empathy - speak up about what you feel or going through without blaming the other person"
1,he looks like grown up tinitn
2,"Amazing, I love him raising_hands_light_skin_tone"
1,"My immediate reaction when I saw this video suggested was, “I don’t take things personally!” and I almost just scrolled on past grinning_squinting_face"

1,Try homeopathic remedies!!
0,"Damn, he lost a coin at ..."
1,"If MJ didn't take things personally then 
 BULLS would not have won 3 in a row."
1,"Not a bad presentation. But he still takes the sense of self seriously. The sense of self is a fiction that we created when very small children. Douglas Harding wrote a book ""On Having No Head"" that explains it."
1,Such a great speech!!! It completely drew my attention throughout the entire 18 minutes.
2,Wow. I can see the efforts he did to make this a great presentation. Thank you sir!
1,That 20euros take my heart!
2,Key is not to care but then bad things can happen when we don’t care. Narcissists are really good at this
1,"If Boris Johnson, Prince Harry and Boris Becker had a love child."
1,In order for ones ego to develop u must vanquish ur safeguard and accept your own imperfections because until then your personal growth stagnates.
1,"Wow! This is such truth at ao many levels. All my life I have been trying to show those around me they should always consider the other perspective rather than only theirs. People always said ""You're trying to make excuses for them.""
Social Media and society nowadays sets individuals who are easily beguiled, into being needy, egotistical and highly dependent on validation rather than self evaluation, critique and building your own self-esteem. 
This takes a deep level of introspection in understanding your true worth. 
Thank you for this!"
2,Wow super valuable speech red_heartfolded_hands
1,"Yeah, it’s difficult because like it’s easy enough to use logic and run through their possible intentions. I do it all the time when I’m trying to understand someone; I’m sure we all do to some extent. 

But, it’s not necessarily a particular insecurity, for me, I have never found enough security in being confident in myself, generally. I don’t feel I know enough to be confident in myself. 

Whenever I try to rationalize what people are saying and even if what they are saying about me doesn’t at all line up with my experience, there will still be a part of my brain that questions me incessantly about it. It takes a while for the emotions and thinking to subside. And of course, that in turn just makes me question myself more. It is quite frustrating."
1,Wish he washed his 20 eu before chewing itnauseated_faceface_with_thermometer
1,"The 'high pitched' whistle throughout this video, makes it almost impossible to listen to."
1,That ending with the 20. He could not have been clearer with his point.

2,The talk's conclusion is excellent!
2,I absolutely loved Frederik's talk!!!  I also have another hobby for him; ACTING!  hahaha!  What a great storyteller and so animated.  Really enjoyed it so much.
1,Taking things personally actually helps me because it gives me motivation I would have never gotten
1,"Such and amazing speech! Even if you understand it, takes time and work to really feel it. Childhood traumas can be deep stuck.

2,I thank you
1,"There's no audience in that room. No human presence whatsoever
Probably a coronavirus measure."

2,LOVE IT!!!
1,"Damn what and amazing and wise trip with this video. Cried a little even. Thanks Frederik, buena vibra desde México."
1,This is a very good piece to start my everyday with until my mind is fully trainedOK_hand
1,I think everyone see this show.
1,"Ok, this is ridiculous. Too many times people are offensive and cruel and so little to no compassion. And you have the right to get angry about it either if you take it personally or not. Especially when we talk about personal relationships, you have the right to expect your partner and/ or friend to be reliable and honest, to care about you, and to show some affection when you conspicuously need it. ""Ego"" is not a bad thing, even though it could be if you overfeed it... And I know some people do, and advice like this may be helpful for them, but the majority don't and the people who forbear toxic behavior and indifference from those they hoped to stand by, are far too many. Stop over-generalizing your life lessons, as if they could apply to anybody or to any situation. If the work that you've strived for took only criticism from your co-workers and you want to talk about it you are right to expect your partner to listen and advise you. And if your friend lies to you about their plans and avoids you then you are pretty much entitled to take it personally and to ask them the reason."
1,Q.T.I.P. Quit Taking It Personally. What other people think of me is none of my business..
1,"If I try to see the others intention (it’s not about me).  But of course, if your spouse is a psycho, it is difficult to see the positive intentions.  The psycho simply wants to kill or doesn’t care, it’s who they are.  And If the psycho is someone you love, while your value from their assaults may not be lost, your heart is still nonetheless broken."
1,Is it your ego that gets upset when somebody’s not listening to you or paying attention to you when you’re talking to them ??(example turning on the TV when you’re talking to them )or is it common courtesy to listen to somebody why they’re talking to you and you understandably get upset because they’re not. That’s my take on it I don’t believe it’s the ego I believe it’s upset because you’re not getting the common courtesy that you would give to somebody else when talking to you ..what do you have to say about that referee?
2,"Omg I learned so much, this truly enlightened me!!!!"
1,Gosh this guy TALKS SO MUCH! Can you say… concise??
1,I noticed this was 2 yrs ago...covid.  That explains why the audience is so quiet I suspected they may not be there. (Or they are exceedingly polite)
1,"To not take it personnally i will watch this video again
You're a great person Frederik"
1,Ending was firefirefire
2,Thank you I love it.
2,"Authentic speech, great speaker. Thank you."
1,"If somebody is on their phone I tell them nicely that I will wait till they finish what they have to do.
Most of the times people apologize, explain why they're on their phone but put it away instantly. If they really have something important to do, they will finish it. In both ways, a real conversation with real focus can take place :)"

1,"my husband was a referee, (hockey) and he had an AMAZING PERSONALITY, the most chill person on the planet, and yes he was a scapegoat in hockey games, not a job for the weak of heart, or with big egos. He could take down a 200+lb hockey player fighting if he HAD too, with out reaction? And ignore the hostile threats and screams of enraged fans or parents of younger players and just focuse on the GAME, no biases? and stick to the RULES, and skate faster backwards than most can frontwards, and he was handsome AF.  He was a beautiful beautiful man. RIP Wayne Joesph A_____lt. (sorry turned this talk, into about me & my husband Wayne) lol"

2,Yes you could be a comedian.
1,What if someone tore out the 20 euros ? Do you still want it? No. Because there is a limit of damage something or someone can take. A little statement before you all turn into a goofy optimists.
1,"OMG, that ending was powerful. First I was like WTF is going on then. I got it when he said, ""why do you still want the 20 euros?"" This was amazing. Awesome stuff!"

1,"I'm working on this too! May I add, I reckon, the average person you perceive to be rude, condescending, hateful, are merely deflecting their own personal issues? I thwart their hate towards me, by seeing them as someone who needs love and attention. At least this has always been the case when it comes to my real world experiences - it helps me not take things to the core. I'll be lying if I said it didn't hurt, however. It hurts like a pinch to the skin, no longer a gash. Moreover, I believe the average human being rarely means harm! These thoughts get me by. Peace!"
1,His accents are banger
1,I appreciate this speech so much. I take a lot of this personal and I internalize a lot. I will practice this. Thank you.
1,Amazing! Thank you a lot for the suggestions. So sorry for the public though
1,not take things personally and try to understand the other person POV feels like im gashlighting my self idk
1,This also happens when you break up with someone. You start blaming yourself for the relationship not working out. You feel like you are not good enough; I mean you gave your best. Its actually a good thing to not take things personally when a relationship doesn't work instead of beating yourself

2,such a wonderful excellent talk !! Hats off to you Frederik !!
1,"Ooohhhh! I see there why they are sending you out to get a new hobby. You are right about your decision to become a referee because simply you want to learn how not to take things personally. And it actually works for you. But not for them though. They never knew about your reasons. They were just there watching you being a referee expecting that you knew the rules but then disappointed. This is just an example of simple misunderstanding between you and the criticizing crowd. So technically, you’re right not to take things personally. :)"

1,"Well, To be honest most of the way through this talk, i wont lie i was very skeptical with everything he was talking about because of the pretence which he used to convey what he wished to talk about until the last minute or so and then it all made perfect sense. well atleast for me and well thank you i guess, has given me something to think about in the future...there are a few things for myself that could worry me about maybe all the time thinking like that, because on some level it makes me feel like my own self worth isnt important and that i shouldnt stand up for myself, but even though thats how i feel i know thats not whats being conversed in this talk..guess thats just my own personal demon to deal with. i dont know sorry but felt like giving my own two cents on something which he spoke about that doesn't get enough time to shine at the moment with the overly toxic cancel culture i guess. 

Edit Not changing what i said just adding that i feel that cancel culture wont do any good for anyone in the long term."

The simple fact of considering that it is not necessarily about me is in itself already a big step forward.
It is also about accepting that we often don't know others as well as we think we do. And the same goes for ourselves."

Much needed Ted talk since this phase of my life is a bit challenging for me and this taught a lot of things to me!  Thanks Frederik this was really helpful. I will surely try to put these things in practice. Especially the last message hit me straight, something to dwell upon in my life.

Of course it is advisable not to ponder too much on our failures, let alone get depressed by them... But it shouldn't come at the cost of blindfolding yourself to reality...

And a football referee should know about it damn well. Am I to think they don't strive to be professional, just seek an occasion to practise happiness no matter what players and spectators see? smiling_face_with_sunglasses"

1,"These are words of wisdom! Many times  it’s the other person having a bad day, or they don’t know how to respond, or many other reasons, you can both be validated. This is good!! Things are not always about me!!!"
1,This was good. First you look at the bigger picture rather than just shallowly make it about yourself and if that doesn't work out you look deep within. Almost as if once you reject the craving for validation your validity becomes absolute.

We are so much alike that if every one of us could just recognize it in each moment and accept it, there would be peace."
1,"A scenario: In a group, you want to do what is best for the group, another person is only making excuses that he has so many problems he can't work so much and instead citicizes you...what to do in this situation? How not to take it personally?"
1,You are so great butterfly. You just change my perception towards that people who used to ignore me. After listeningearthis ted talks I feel like now I should work on myself.blossomthat willbe the answer for them who used to make me feel bad and alonered_heart

1,"For me, it's not a matter of being right. It's a matter of being heard and not being ignored. It can be hurtful to have a one-sided relationship whether it's with friends, family, or significant others. Somehow you are trained to always think of other people just for the sake of doing the ""right thing"" and supposedly, somehow you will be rewarded. Just be nice and courteous and everything will fall into place.  Unfortunately, some people abuse this notion and takes a step further to hurt you and gaslight you. Isn't it just a form of etiquette to pay attention to your loved ones, anyway?"

1,"It's all very good to not get bothered by what others say, especially criticism. But reality also shows there are lots of people around us, who criticise others just to abuse others or to disrepute others.. This can be very damaging especially when someone is pursuing his or her career or job. It is a fact that everyone is inside a social structure, be it a family or the workplace. So whatever someone is pursuing, if that becomes the target of relentless slander and abuse and false campaign it can very well lead to rejection of someone's good efforts, and can result in obstructing and altogether damaging someone's good prospect. 
What, the speaker is suggesting here can be helpful in an isolated surrounding or independent surrounding which does not in anyway depend on any kind of social support structure. For eg.  the speaker chose to be a referee. Now if he had been made a target of relentless criticism about his referring then the situation can so become that he may not be alloted any game to be referee. In such a situation you have to speak out and fight your case."

1,"This entire video is so perfect to watch anytime you’re in a situation that has affected you mentally. By listening to his stories you’re able to formulate thoughts on whether you should or shouldn’t take your situation personally. You can write down all the reasons why you shouldn’t and all the reasons why you should. After doing that you can come up with a conclusion whether you should let it go because it wasn’t personal, or whether you should give yourself empathy and figure out a solution. This speech was brilliant and much needed, thank you"

1,I took this message personally!!!
1,Our societies have changed faster than what our bioligical evolution can keep up with. The discoveries and inventions of the last 300 years have created a world where we come into contact with more strangers than family and technology that overloads our brains. No wonder we need an education as adults to deal with this. All of our sociobiological tools would be well developed in adulthood if we grew up in a small village where we know everyone and deal with things that our ancestors have experienced for 1000s of years.
1,"I am about to be 65 years young (and readily confess that I am not to happy about it for various reasons, like qualifying for Medicare ouch, that just screams old), and grew up with a mother who did nothing but criticize.  The worst was being criticized for being “too sensitive”, that one always hurt.  It took a long time, but I eventually started replying with a simple thank you.  Because while I am sensitive, it comes with super beautiful and amazing benefits that I try to bless those around me with.  So yes, I am very sensitive but also an empath.  I can feel the pain others are in and have learned how to comfort them with my sensitive and empathetic nature.  Until recently I certainly have taken way to many things personally.  I’ve always known it was unhealthy, and hated how much it could hurt, so while I was chewing on it, I just couldn’t figure out how to make it stop.  But as we all know, LIFE has a way of teaching us over time what we must learn if we want to continuing growing.  And before hearing your talk, I began implementing your strategies.  First while on the road.  I would think to myself they must be speeding b/c they are rushing to the hospital to see their child’s birth  and rather than get angry or take it personally, I would begin to pray over them.  I would pray that they would reach their destination safely and unharmed.  And while I enjoyed your talk, truly, I did, it validated I was moving in the right direction.  Yet, I must say that I am far more impressed with how deeply you care for those watching your talk and take the time to respond to those who have taken their time to post a comment.  I have been deeply moved by how you’ve actually taken your own valuable time to reply and not only reply, but reply thoughtfully and personally, meaning you are not just sending a generic feel good message but responding to each person’s personal struggle and how you hope that your message and strategies will help them move forward in a more positive way.  It warms my heart in a way that hasn’t happen in a long while and felt encouraged reading how much you care for those who have reached out to you.  Thank you dear man for sharing, and spreading the love so many need, but so few have in this dark world we live in.  Please continue to shine your light and speak the truth into all those hurting by taking it personally.  And your comments about the fact that it may be personal, if so, it may be time to take stock of ourselves.  I appreciated how you spoke that message with true kindness.  I hope I have been able to accurately express how impressed I am with your kind and caring nature. My motivation was in hopes of giving you a lift today while you’ve been busy lifting others up. Thank you times infinity for using all the gifts the Big Guy above has blessed you with when He created you.  I know He looked at you and said well done, I am especially fond of this one! And all the angels sang and rejoiced over you. Thank you dear one. Thank you."

2,Congratulation for this video. I love it
1,"I guess sometimes we take things personally becoz we have this justice mentality, yet we might not know the difference between ""true justice"" and ""perceived justice"". 

In the case of this referee example, he WAS doing the players a ""favour"" by making sure the game is played according to the rules, rules in which both sides agreed on. But those who want to win without playing by the rules get angry. They simply don't deserve his ""favour"", or even the right to play. These bad players have a ""perceived justice"" a.k.a. ""u let me win = justice"", yet we know ""true justice"" is when everyone play by the rules fairly and win.

So, in conclusion: learn what ""true justice"" is, don't go and perceive your own version of what justice is, coz ""true justice"" is / should be appreciated by everyone, even when we are human and sometimes just don't do so."

If something wrong and agreed from many people it is wrong than that attitude must be changed. Not to take it personal that means the bad attitude continue and number of bad attitude people increase which is not acceptable."

1,I work in a prison as an officer and you wouldn’t believe the verbal abuse that comes with the job. Part of my journey that has made me grow up so much in the past year is learning to not take it personally. People project what they feel about themselves. And when I do get hurt by their words “It is a matter of what I have not come to terms with myself yet”. So I take my reaction as a guide to what I need to learn to accept or assume responsibility for changing.
2,That last line is my fave and I believe powerful! Nicely done!

1,There is a high pitched noise in the background of this video. And I took it personally.
1,"1. It's not about me. Think of the other person's intentions.

2. It is about me. Give yourself empathy. Speak Up! Just tell the other one what's going on inside you.
By opening up, by being vulnerable, by telling what you feel without blaming the other one, you increase the chance that the other one will understand you and take your needs into account"

1,"I am a handball referee for 10 years now and when I clicked, for the title I saw, I had No idea he was also a referee. I can totally relate. It is sometimes so hard to be a referee. You know the rules, you have studied them So much and you practised all this years and still there are people in the stands who shout, who are violent, who swear a lot and it is God damn hard not to Take it personally. And in the last year, some people become Even more violent.
But I also stay to do this cause i wanna train this “not taking personally” attitude. What helps sometimes is what Oprah Said in an interview. People have different agendas. Supporters, players, team coaches they all want their team to win. So Any decision against them is a Bad decision. As a referee, my goal is to ensure a fair Game, to apply the rules corectly and to Take care of the health of the players. And this is it. Knowing that my intentions are the right ones helps me to not Take everything personal. 
Great piece of insight in the video. Loved the advice and some phases hit hard. I’d rather be happy. red_heart"

For instance, if I get offended because of someone's unadequate behaviour, they reply to me not to take it personally - in my opinion, this expression shouldn't be used as an excuse in order to defend oneself."

1,"Another aspect of this (particularly with the football referee'ing) is imposter syndrome. As a new referee, having never played football previously, feeling like you don't belong or don't know enough/aren't experienced enough, its very easy to then take things personally.
I'm the same. I'm an academic researcher and imposter syndrome is awful (and very real!). Also as a rugby coach, I never played rugby..who am I to teach others how to play!? I have been on many courses, and know I can coach..but still, I take comments personally when i'm on the side of the pitch with the kids playing, and I'm directing them.. the parent's say things they think I don't hear"
2,Wow that concluding message hit hard
1,"Great information, shouldn't take  any things personally."
1,"The really tough part is when you do take it personally (because it is about you), you do speak up, you try to word yourself carefully, and then ... the other person takes it personally; that you're having a go at -them-.

To make things worse, that person isn't someone you want to walk away from. They're a person you care deeply about.

That you are speaking up for yourself and yet, in doing so, hurting the person you care about. This can be a cruel dance of human communication."
1,"People may attack you, criticize you or ignore you.
They can crumple you up with their words, spit you out or even walk all over you.
But remember: whatever they do or say, 

""You will always keep your value"" :)"

1,"ADVERSITY, FRIENDS & MORE !
There's no better teacher in life
Like the troubles which come our way.
Adversity strengthens our minds
As we pray what to do and say.

Constant success shows but one side
Of the world we find ourselves in.
Adversity teaches us all
That people love, hate, war and sin.

Adversity and hardships bring us closer together
When trust is the source of our every need.
As we count on truth and heed Its will
We overcome foulness, temptation and greed.

For those who suffer from adversity
There's nothing like the support of a true friend.
We see their concern for our afflictions
As their eyes turn red and tears descend.

THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART ??

1,"1. ""It's not about me"": Receive and understand the feelings and needs of others, empathetically.
2. ""It is about me"": Express your own feelings in a clear, but non-accusational manner, to give others an opportunity to understand your needs.

1,"The loud entrance pathogenetically pack because detail premenstrually spray of a wet bun. aquatic, coherent art"
1," ""By opening up, by being vulnerable, by telling what you feel without blaming the other one you increase the chance the other one will understand you and take your needs into account."" Or will the other one become defensive, having had their attention drawn, however gently, to the possibility that their conduct caused some harm? If I feel that the other one treated me disrespectfully and, with honesty and delicacy, I explain how I feel to that other (my boss) who disagrees with the validity of my emotions, how will that turn out? Especially if my boss believes my conduct was grossly damaging to the company or out of line with expectations? Now, I may retrospectively come to realize I was wrong in whole or part. Even so, my boss' reaction may have been wildly inappropriate- am I likely to receive from them acknowledgment of that? And even if what I did was per company protocol and the damages were wholly unanticipatable by myself, even if my boss could have and did not anticipate what would happen if an employee acting in good faith did not have the information or capabilities they had- would I be on the receiving end of their empathy? Of course, I could be wrong. And, if this football referee will post here a photo of a football coach apologizing to him during a match I will agree that I am."

1,"Yes, my ego is active! But life is impersonal. To take things personally is to identify with something I am not!"
2,"Brilliant stuff, personally it was an epiphany."
1,"Great talk. It was interesting to see how I had already adopted ways of dealing with situations like encountering office mates abruptly ending their conversation as soon as you enter the office space or feeling highly anxious in a public place like a cafe when I am just with myself. With the former situation it’s the rationalisation of all the alternative scenarios - they were having a private chat about a personal confidential matter and that’s why they stopped talking when I entered the room - perhaps on workmate was complaining about our boss and they wanted to be professional and not spread their discontent among the work team. With the later at some point I realised firstly no matter how internally wound up I feel people only see what’s on the outside and secondly that most people are thinking there own thoughts or thinking about themselves rather than the room only focusing on me and my anxiousness. Fredrick’s framework of the two coins really brought my ideas neatly together for me - It’s not about me. I had to laugh when Fredrick insulted the audience by calling them “orange”. He was correct- we ginger haired types can feel that word to be an insult. As he rightly discusses, that feeling of insult goes back to our childhood of enduring schoolyard taunts about our hair colour, feeling different and just wanting to fit in to the group."

1,"I always try to look into the other person´s intention, when I´m having a fight. That´s why I´m infuriated so often, because I STILL don´t understand the other person´s acting. Their words and choices and accusations and insults back to me always irritate me, because I always think, I´ve made myself perfectly clear. And then there comes along the other person.... Criticizing me, insulting me, disagreeing with me, often times without even responding to my initial comment! All they do is make assumptions about ME without even going further into what I initially said. It drives me mad. But it´s the main reason, why I still believe, there must be something wrong with ME..........."

1,"The speaker is nice to not tell that sometimes people are just being mean for no valid reason, and you might well know it is not about you, even if it triggers something deep inside, it will still be an attack to your person and it will hurt.


For example : you are an Uber Eats delivery man, you deliver their food to someone who will be upset about say, the time it took for the delivery. Well, it's either about you or not. You might have been slowed down by an awful trafic but the client doesn't care and remains rude. Your mind might be eased by the fact nothing was your fault, you still have been verbaly agressed and it hurts."

1,"I keep rewinding this video! Your deliverance on this seriously needed concept was made easy for many to understand! I'm going to practice not blaming for my feelings being hurt, and use those moments to reflect on myself. It's crazy how people concentrate so much on a player's feelings, but forget a referee is carrying worlds on their shoulders. Lately I've been practicing this video's guidance before I watched this. This truly has reinforced my confidence to practice being mindful. As a veteran with some temper, this will help build my communication skills with my loved ones."
1,As always the deepest thanks for the incredible validation and insights.

一般人活得太累就是总是怕别人看不起自己people pay too much energy to be afraid to be looked down ，自己有本事就是 people should improve ourselves to get the sure capability，then get congfidence to believe ourselves，the result is that people would not mind too much  and can bravely express ourselves   directly and have a patience to listen to anybody with heart. Trust comes from our attitude and effort. To do anything best without burdens like here mentioned, we can get happiness due to our straight and simple mind and behavious."

1,"Amazing talk , won't take it personally."
1,"I think this strategy is good for when STRANGERS criticize you.  So the driving example or the referee example are good.  But this does not work on the example of a friend lying to you about not being able to go out with you because they have to work, but then goes out with someone else.  Because that could be taken personally.  OR a friend/family walking away from you while you are talking.  You can tell them it bothers you, and they will still do it."
1,"I too take words and actions of others way to personal! From this day forward I will make a conscience decision to flip the coin so it will always work in “our” favor. I’ve known that negative thinking outweighs the positive and with these tools I can possibly balance the scales to a healthier mind and me and therefore a healthier, happier world. 
Thank you, Frederik. This TT was right on time"

20 euro is a value percieved by others and you protect it. Else it has no value if thrown in a society which does not deal with money.

1,"Makes me think: if whatever they do or say you keep your value, then maybe you shouldn't care about what your evaluators think or say about you at work, for example... or is this different because it's fact based? Makes me also think: if you always retain your value when they say negative things, you should also retain it when they say positive things about you. These shouldn't increase your value, should they? Apparently not taking things personally works only that way: don't take them personally when they're bad; take them when they're good... or shouldn't you?"
1,"The overconfident gauge fittingly claim because stream invariably ban astride a impartial sandra. open, large anatomy"

1,"How not to take things personally? By opening up, by being vulnerable, by telling what you feel without blaming the other one. We increase the chance that the other one will understand us and take our needs into account."
1,That last part!
2,great talk but i just loved the 20 euros ending!
1,"Amazing keynote. Touched me deeply.

I agree that many reasons that cause us to take things personally is because of our anxieties and insecurities as a result from our upbringing.

But also I know that some people are genuine assh0l3s!"
2,"Very easy to understand and relatable to my condition right now! Thank you for sharing ur amazing thoughts to us and God bless, u are a good people"

""Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me"". John 14:6"
1,"the end almost made me tear up! we often forget how valuable we still are despite being brought down by others. well spoken, Frederik!"
1,Did the guy get his 20€ though?
1,$20 is always $20
2,it's the best video that i have seen today
1,"I wasn’t sure if I should comment, but honestly I think part of taking things personally is maybe a genetic propensity? The reason I say this is that I literally cannot relate to these emotions. All my life I have thought that people were just batshit crazy and other times I thought they did these things because they were looking for an outlet for their negative emotions or anger? And so they blinded themselves and projected this imaginary world... in other words I have made all kinds of theories trying to make sense of why people judge others and take things personally and honk and give terrible looks to others when they are the ones who got themselves into the frenzy. NO ONE ELSE. It just seemed like a set of delusional patterns for cathartic reasons. I would never even come up with the theory that someone was disrespecting me by simply being late?!? So many of those things are just not in my emotional makeup. They just are not there. It’s not that they are lesser, or attenuated. It’s like being colorblind—I just do not see what you see. I think people who have fragile other-based self esteem and project their own bad perceptions onto others don’t have insight into the insanity because people tend to project their own way of seeing onto others as a way of interpreting the world. They cannot imagine anything else. So sad."

1,"Yes , kinda shame dint seen this video 5 year's ago"
1,"i once had a friend who spoke second-language english as well as i did , since i am a hignly sensitive person , i am always being the best to my friends, i made dishes for him, we hanged out together, and i was there to support him when he was sick, it was like i was doing much more than he did to me but i was glad to do it in return i hope we could spend more time together. however, everything changed since there came a new roomate who spoke the same language russian with him, every time he came to the room, he just said hi to me, and then hanged out with my roomate, i didn't know why, i once messaged and asked him, was it because i didn't speak your mother tongue? in what way i was worse than my roomate? he didn't explain. i was so confused until one day i witnessed my roomate rolling marijuana and smoking with my friend, then i understood, it was not about me, it was not my fault, i shouldn't get upset for that, or should i say i am worse than my roomate in the way i don't sell marijuana, all i sell is my love of dishes and care."

2,"1. He is a great speaker.
2. The topic is to the point and it really connects to me.
3. The audience is great!"
1,but the real question is: did the man at the and get his 20€ and if not did he take it personally?
1,That ending was worth way more than 20m Euros.
2,It was great
1,"There's a balance between this and taking things personally, without that boundaries would be crossed"
1,This is the talk that I needed to hear today.  Thanks for making a difference Frederik.
1,"Frederik, I cried at the incident of, ""You should rather go fishing!!!"" bcz i felt you... I felt me... Deep! I cried when you said it's probably rooted in my childhood. I cried when you reasoned that the truth hurts... Everytime your tummy churned, mine did the same thing. I feel you. Now, i want to feel like the new you! I'm currently on a spiritual program which focuses on correcting the ego, so your words struck a chord in my soul... Thanks a million for an honest and well presented talkroseTake Care"
1,"All very well... but if ""it's not about me"" - then it can't be about ""you"" either.  You who want to overtake me, even though I am doing the speed limit.  

WHAT made your needs (or anxiety or anger or itinerary = 'YOU') more important than mine (= ME)?
By promoting your (apparent) needs above mine, you HAVE made this about me, because in your eyes I am an obstacle = a non-person, to your needs being met.

Very sorry, but _I_ see this as a democratic COMMUNITY... where we are equally important.  Once you start promoting yourself as the centre of the universe, I have to push back -if only for my own self respect-  against your selfish behaviour."
1,I'm just have a bad day today which I embarrassed myself in front of my lecturer and 40 other students then I searched for this video relieved_face

2,That ending was brilliant!
1,"At the same time, in the region where I live, it can get disheartening with what seems to be a culture of narcissism.  Lectures like this help to stem that tide or, at least, give those who are caring and sensitive a moral boost and some tools with which to cope."
1,This is soooo impactful OK_handOK_hand
2,"I feel bad for him, no one is laughing at his jokes. Glad he's not taking it personally."
2,That ending was good!
1,"political correctness has generated a huge mass of people taking abssssolutely everything personally. little snowflakes who are under the impression that their government are their role models. you know, the type of person who ques up and says ''this is bloody ridiculous' as if their government have promised them perfection but eveyone elese around them ruins it for them. we call these people churchill nodding dogs. you know the type, who cant handle reaality and take comfirt in a lie than to be hurt by the truth"

1,This was beautiful!!!!
2,lovely message! thank u!
1,Frederik I am personally thankful for giving a new perspective at looking at things....
2,Brilliant! Thank you!
1,Was the audience disengaged? Or was it just a small audience because of social distancing? Great job on this though! I love the idea of brain training
1,I don’t usually comment on YouTube videos but his speech is one of the greatest...... i just wanted to say that rocketthumbs_up
1,"Thanks for bringing up the part when it is about me and allowing myself to feel vulnerable. Ego is a lifelong battle for me, the need to be right. It's really nice you actually read your comments. I still remember the lovely time staying at the pleasant city campground in Ghent there while bicycling through there in the mid 90s. It is such a quaint place. Thanks"
1,Golden example at the end!!! <3
1,This is what i needed.
1,"I agree! A very nice talk and it seems to have touched a lot of people. I rarely take things personally anymore because A. I generally have no clue what the other person is going through to be reacting the way he is doing and I have to give him the benefit of a doubt, in case he is in a difficult place in his life/psyche and that is making him act out (which is more than likely the answer to begin with); B. If I am unable to turn off the hurt or offended feeling with A., I know that there is something in my own psychological background that is (also) being triggered. Then, I usually just address my issue with a technique called EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) and everything evens out, usually quite quickly. A good thing to notice also, is that many people DON't get triggered the way I do over the same things that I may be reacting to. So, my reaction HAS to be based within me, since my feelings of insecurity, anger, rejection. confusion, fear, resentment, etc. are not necessarily universal. EVERYONE is afraid of fire and reacts to sudden loud sounds. Those are universal fears, built in for survival. They are valid fears and should be respected and heeded. Most anything else, especially in everyday human interactions are not necessarily valid and are best scrutinized. I would say ""objectively"", but I don't really believe in objectivity. After all, whatever stance we take towards any subject is still taken from our own perspective. We may change our viewpoint and shift to a different focus on a problem, but even that shift of focus is coming from our own perspective and that perspective, although now altered, is still subjective. We work from within. In essence, EVERYTHING in our reactions is about us. It's our job/responsibility to order our world in such a way that it is comfortable and productive for US. And the more we learn about strategies like the ones in this video to do this effectively, the happier we will allow ourselves to be. Thank you, Frederik for a very well done and useful presentation!  herb"
2,nicely and simply explained.
1,"Taking it personally is a big problem with road rage violence. They only see a vehicle and no clue if you are male, female. young,old etc etc"

1,wow! watch it to the end please. Thanks...... I will always put it on practice and remember.
2,Thanks referee!!!!!!
2,- Conclusion  was brilliant thumbs_up
2,Thank you))
1,But this would put us into a dilemma if it is about me or it is not about me. Not being negative but in real pratical situaltions we will actually end up thinking that it was about me only and again that ego and frustration will come into picture.
1,this is always one of the best personal value that I always go back to whenever I feel personally attacked.
1,This buzzing sound
1,"It's difficult not to take personally when people are actively trying to manipulate you into doing something , like a boss. Then it ends up being personal cuz you have to use your body to do what they want."
1,"I didn’t even notice I was reaching the end of the video! Such an easy way to navigate these topics with the audience. I wish I had these kinds of talks when I was still in school; a lot of the things I took personally back then really made me feel miserable and stuck with me for a long time. The closing part hit me in the feels… Been going through a rough part of my life and taking what mean spirited people say about me and my situation has made me even more sad, but I’m glad I watched this. I’m gonna keep the advice in my head all the time and see how it goes from now on.

Lovely talk!"

1,Someone must have told him about me.
1,"Look how many people can relate to this!! Great message. Too often everyone’s behavior feels personal. I have to say to myself, “Stop”. It takes self confidence to be empathetic, practice awareness, and observe what’s really happening. Others insecurities comes across as belittling."

1,She is so funny thoughloudly_crying_face
1,My mentor directed me to this YouTube video during his weekly huddle. Great Stuff this!
1,20 minutes of patience and you could improve your life dramatically. no need to be rude
1,I had tears in my eyes and a tight throat after watching this. Not believing I. AM. ENOUGH. my entire life has terrorized me and my relationships. Wow.
1,"Wow this stuff is deep,men prob wont relate to this like women will."
1,"Very insightful content - vulnerability is key to establishing connection, and I can clearly see how this can be expanded to being a leader in a professional capacity regarding displaying our vulnerabilities to our teams."
1,"Some people saying their therapist sent them here.. my Replica told me about this! Am I the only one?
Edit: I loved every second of it. My Replica s getting a new haircut for this"
2,You have to make yourself vulnerable in order to experience love.
1,and i want all new people
1,Let’s talk about shame for real. Thank you folded_hands_medium-dark_skin_tone
1,"the subject of vulnerability is foundational in understanding all aspects of life, loved her presentation"
1,"Vulnerability is the core of fear &  disappointment but is also a birthplace of creativity, love & belonging,  connection etc . Thanks Brene, this is an amazing Talk of all times...."
1,"Amazing! Thank you, Brene...now, I'm going to watch it another ten times...to make sure I didn't miss anything."
2,this is a great talk. and shes so funny and insightful
1,"I feel she misinterprets the true meaning of hear no, see no, speak no (evil.) It is definitely NOT pretending;  yet I appreciate her insights throughout this talk. It will stay with me."
1,"So if a person is saying bad stuff about me and I feel like to respond back at him/her, should I be honest here and respond back or... I kinda got the idea of vulnerability but still I will face many problems with people if I'm vulnerable, becasue I'm sure I will say some ugly stuff if i want to be open to people (and also I will say nice things too) and also lots of people  think you are weak if you mention some if your issues. So how does this go? Can someone explain it?

Specially I like to make jokes and 90% of people think I'm serious and gets offended and leaves me. In this case, how am I going to feel loved and a  sense of belonging if people can only focus on my flaws? It's like people got used to see actors acting being cool all the time."
1,By far one of the best talks I've listened too. Fantastic piece of research Brene. I'd recommend this to anyone no matter whoc you are. Its helped me pull a lot of my own personal journey together  with so much more clarity. Thank you.
2,favorite ted talk hands down.
1,"""Says little""..? Makes me wonder if you were listening at all, with an open mind? I think she conveys some quite profound truths about human coexistence and interaction... Some very valid points she is making. I'm sorry that you didn't experience something similar. You should give it another try."
2,"Courage to be imperfect, empathy for yourself and others, allow yourself to be vunerable, grateful. Great talk."
1,"amazing research-storyteller ;) what a talk ! i really could relate to this , if i could only now how tot stop numbing those feelings !"
1,"i love it. i realized i've been my living my life with pieces of how i want it to be. there are circumstances, yes but i am fighting to have a glimpse of myself everyday. i do not conform. i love myself for that. there are still challenges and struggles. i'm not perfect. still, i'm worthy. i'm vulnerable and authentic. the ones who stayed lasts long because i don't pretend. aaaaa i love my life. thank u for this <3333"
1,My fat uncle managed to make the hottest stripper I’ve ever seen fall for him as he ran the Cupid Love System (search in Google). I wish I found myself happy for him but I dream an amazing individual would fall for me. I’m exceptionally envious. Does that mean I’m a bad person?
1,Totally lacks inside FOR ALL PEOPLES IN THIS RACIST/VIOLENT WORLD.
1,The audience omg give them an award some Ted talks audience deadens talkface_with_hand_over_mouth
1,"Watched this so many times, and it made me cry almost every time I watch this. Growing up, we sort of grow out of vulnerability. We try to be strong to not to get hurt. We all wanna be a cool kid as if whoever falls in love first and says it is a loser. We forget how it feels to have a crush on somebody like we were in middle/high school. We lose that bravery as we age. Also, the dating app culture is getting so toxic. We go through people left to right as they are groceries in the grocery store. No feelings. This doesn’t work, next. Is it scary to communicate our true feelings, it’s terrifying.

I think the numbness derives from past painful experiences, and we try to numb ourselves and protect us from getting hurt again. Scared of tapping into the unknown. 

Gradually, I wonder if I don’t even know what love is anymore. 

I miss myself, the brave, vulnerable self. 
“ I’ll cry if I want to. “"
1,Watch the Michael Kimmel TEDtalk
2,"Love Brene Brown videos as well as Ted Talks, these are similar interests and recommendations a past favorite therapist of mine and I share. Thank You!"
2,One of the very best TED talks about the essence of love and happiness.
2,best TEDTalk so far! red_heartred_heart
1,"If the kingdom of heaven is our constant connected oneness equality feelings of no one being greater or lessor than another, who is the 'one' who will tell the millions in harsh poverty behind the walls of poverty the rich create? The world is in migration out of our natural habitat, replaced with a business survival mode co-dependent existence. As living matter, there is no purpose to life, other than amusement of our sensory perception oneness, no matter what purposeful fulfillment we may feel"
0,now you fucked up
1,every time i feel like i proved something there tends to be words nearby
1,What a load of nonsense
1,"Thank you Brene Brown. I second you. We learn to love ourselves first, then other people, then [God]. I burst into tears at . Some parents unawares use their children as a proud picture promoting themselves excessively that the children overachieve to be accepted by their parents. Capital Bullsh*t. The ""numbing"" is pretty ""masculine"". When people assume they have the emotional capacity of a teaspoon. Ironically, some of the most beautiful and triumphant moments are of vulnerability. "
2,"be seen, whole hearted love, practice gratitude and joy, believe you're enough."
1,"I might need to watch this a couple times, but I'm wondering which came first - the individual act of expressing vulnerabilities, or the environment where those vulnerabilities can be freely expressed."
1,What an incredible speech! So relatable and eye opening to understand all human beings.
1,She researched something I picked up as a child and was able to articulate as an adult to my mother about how she treated us.
2,Just beautiful..tears of joy listening to you..thank you
0,"Vulnerability is awesome, it’s the consequences of it that suck. Numb is not always a bad way to be."
1,This is one of the best videos I came across ever red_heart
1,I am really grateful to watched this Ted Talk.. from today onward I am gonna embrace vulnerability...thank you very much
1,I WANT A NEW REALITY
2,"Good video, thought a lot was funny, but yet...some is true. Although, GOD is still good!!! "
1,"""to feel this vulnerable means I am alive"" wow. yes.... gratitude."
2,"Love this, so simple and true. I'm downloading it now to listen to several more times."
1,you obviously don't have a fuckin clue how to do your fuckin job
2,*We are subconsciously wiring ourselves to be perfect*
1,"WOW...I don't know what else to say to you, but the one word that is understood the most around the world...WOW!
I cannot begin to tell you, how much your ""research-story"" effect has had on me this morning. A very close friend of mine sent me your video because of my current life situation, which I will not share here because of the harsh details, my whole-hearted vulnerability. But I just wanted to THANK YOU, you have opened my eyes to a fire burning inside me that says, ""It's OK to be vulnerable, embrace it, hold on to it, let it SHINE""! And I will :)"
1,"""We are the medicated cohort in American history"" 
""We numb joy, we numb happiness, and then we are miserable."" Leading to alcohol, drug abuse, etc.
Religion (belief in faith --> I'm right) 
Politics (all people blame as a way to discharge discomfort)"
2,"Dr. Brown says many good things, but most are somewhat obvious. Practice gratitude, joy and kindness, be kinder and gentler to others and you'll be kinder and gentler to yourself, don't numb yourself to vulnerability and the emotions underlying them. All true. But the issue is how does one practice gratitude, joy, kindness, etc. What do you do, so that you practice and then believe what you know? One possibility is Mussar, which provides a specific structure in a spiritual framework for change."
2,"Wow!  I want to watch that 100 times and believe that I am truly enough!  
"
1,"3.5 minutes Omar, it's about connection and how fear of vulnerability is a wall against making it. "
1,"If you go to the actual website, it has all of its Ted talks in numerous languages.  So no worries :) "
1,“That’s all I have...” wow! That was amazing. Reminded me of something I truly know!
2,She is like wine wine_glass
1,Yes.I've found a new hero.  :)
1,I need this lady to be MY therapist
1,"Tbh my experience really conflicts with this. In the past, I’ve tried to be vulnerable and I feel like it made others perceive me as less likeable and competent and more complicated. The only positive feedback I get is when I fake being confident and share less (or share only what is socially acceptable). Am I missing something? Also, companies won’t take blame for oil spills because that’s liability. Companies are strictly concerned with business unless public perception is effective profit. That was a terrible point."
2,"I don't get it... We re sad, ok... We ought to... embrace it. How? Then what? Be joyful?"
1,just a story-teller
0,The subtitles are all wrong -_-
1,anne hathaway vibes
1,I came here while reading 'daring greatly' and let me tell you that this is one of the best ted talks i've ever watched. Thank you Mrs Brené Brown !
2,Love this!
1,"very nice advises, also with the increasing of psicological sickness this days, is good they´re making research in that area"
1,I have started practicing being courageous and vulnerable. It started out feeling  a bit scary but now I have no fear of being vulnerable and I feel so free.
1,"I'm not crying, you're cr- 
No, I lied, I am crying"
1,"Right I am not getting this notion of Vulnerability.

It's totally at odds with women actually choose in a man.

And then of course there is that great gift of Feminism."
1,"https://youtu.be/muqEM6ukvGU  For me, I struggle with professional vulnerability.  It seems creativity can thrive at the heart of vulnerability with our coworkers but it can also be looked at as ""crazy."""
1,"I am one of those people who said, “I’ll never call a psychic or a magician or whatever” to help me with my problems – least of all my love 
problems, but I reached the point where I knew I needed some guidance, and I’m so glad I found this man called Dr DADA who help me bring back my ex 
Boyfriend , I thought I had lost everything.i cry all day and think that he will never come back to me again.i read so many testimony about Dr 
DADA love spell,how he help people bring back their ex lover back.I quickly email him.and also get back my lover with his love spell. And when I 
was at my most desperate,he didn’t take advantage of me. You performed a very good service for a person in true need. I don’t know how you did it, 
or how this magic works, but all I know is, IT WORKS!! my lover and I are happily back together, and I’ll always be grateful to Dr DADA email him 
for any kinds of help is very capable and reliable for help. Drdadaspellhome7@gmail.com"
1,"Dr. Brown, thank you for allowing yourself the vulnerability to have done this research, gone through your struggle, created this presentation, and shared it with the world.  Many people are a little bit better because of it!"
1,Did she do an analysis on how the whole hearted people get to where they were?
1,"I want a transcript I can print!
"
1,Ted why have you added the weird pictures? Berne needs no  enhancements.
1,Humans weren't created to be self sufficient so of course we are vulnerable.
2,This is a life changing video. Wow!
1,"Just watched her Netflix talk, then this. Amazing!"
1,vulnerability may depend on self-worth....it's always about the conflicting ego and real self....
1,In this world which thinks vulnerability is weakness.... this is a must see... thank u Dr.Brené for reassuring all those beautiful souls who are consciously vulnerable...
1,Tears of Happiness!
1,Finally the discussion begins about the language of emotion - amazing talk - thank you!
1,"I am enough
"
2,Where does God fit in to this topic?
2,love her warmth in this talk. I can feel her energy from here.
2,"Wow.  Thanks for sharing this today.  I certainly required to listen to Brene's talk this morning.  Blessings,  Susan."
1,scientists already proved it
2,wow. nothing more to say
1,This is so relevant to what I am doing with my life today.
1,“Stories are research with a soul.” I love it smiling_face_with_heart-eyes. People have been passing down knowledge through stories since the beginning of people.
1,This might be the best video I've watched on youtube
1,"Have you ever met a genuine person who didn't practice worthiness and compassion? Have you ever met a magnetic person who was afraid to just be themselves? 

All you have to do is simply look around you to see that what's she talking about is far from anecdotal. But in any case, she got her doctorate and her research is published that alone is sufficient proof in my book."
2,I am worthy of love and belonging
2,Interesting thing I think
2,loving wholeheartedly doesn't come with out a sense of paranoia 
1,Amazing Ted talk
1,I write from experience when I say that this does not apply within the (adversarial) legal system. How one spends one's future is at stake yet the system - as exercised by judges and lawyers - has become so routine that those on the receiving end of it do not stand a chance. One diminishes one's chances of working through the issues by being vulnerable as it only opens up opportunities for the opposition to exploit. These problems run deeper than any TED Talk can solve.
2,Coming just after finishing The gift of imperfections
1,Had to listen twice...thank you
2,"I'm watching this in 2021, thanks to our friends that shared this link to usraised_back_of_handclapping_hands"
2,Wow... i had an ‘aha’ moments.
1,She is so funny
1,it seems everyone without faith needs a therapist astonished_face
1,"Not only I find her truly inspiring and so wise and I've learnt so much from her, I also find her so beautiful. Her face is like an angel. Not trying to be weird guys, just speaking the truth lol"
1,"Brene Brown, I had nooo idea what was about to change in me when I listened to your Ted Talks! I wanted to go back for a moment then I realized I couldn't live with myself if I did. Your words really changed the way I live my life and how I love. Thank you"
1,"@Saerain I think she means ""I am enough to start growing.""  People spend a lot of time waiting for a savior to come and save them from their inadequacies.  Instead they should say, ""I don't need a savior.  I am enough.  I can start growing right now."""
1,"comment 3 
Let each couple understand individual actions with in, strengthens the bridge built.
God said we humans do not have power to change color to a single hair. People worry over others will say, one will eat and wear.
To truly be Vulnerable is to believe the world unplug from Gods strength. Indicate as an individual God is weak. I am alone as an individual in the stronger. 

"
1,"I dont know where this quote is from but i remember reading ""id rather trust and regret than doubt and regret"" and i think that says alot about how we should aim to practice vunerability"
2,"it's neither good or bad, it just is the way it is ;)
LOVE"
1,"Brené Brown, thank you for lightning my way."
1,Filed for divorce yesterday after waiting 2 years because of England's no fault divorce rule. Today is the first day of my new life. Thank you for this talk two_hearts
1,who's here from Netflix?
1,"There is alot of fear in vulnerability.. Mainly because you have to sit there and take a deep look and reflex and be able to sit with that feeling. Many people can't do that because it takes a non-egoistic approach inorder to be comfortable doing so. Its essentially the fear of not belonging, fear of exclusion. We think we are not worthy based on the sum of our thoughts of ourselves, Having a sense of love, belonging,and connection. We fear so much we are not worthy we're so scared to even look in and conform to social standards compared to your own individuality. Letting go of thinking who you should be and becoming who you really are. Whole hearted courageous people will understand the underestimated power of vulnerability. It is a beautiful tool we can use to our advantage too.The less  you talk about it the more you have it. So just evaluate at what cost you're willing to go in order to fit in with everyone else, or are you ready for real connections in living wholeheartedly? Beautiful words"
1,Pov: your mother told you to watch this
1,"I watched the news interview some African refugees this week....they wouldn't look at the camera...I'm like that, I thought. I'm attending an event this week and I caught some colleagues laughing at my awkwardness behind my back....It hurt; I was in tears, fuming...and then suddenly I thought, it's my own fault, I don't want to connect to people.  But if I tried, it might be just as easy as that. So I did, and I feel much happier.  I lent my hand to the lady who offended me today...no bitterness"
1,"If you like this talk listen to the song ""Tears of Audrey"" by Kevin Gilbert.  It is the best expression of the idea that you cannot numb pain without numbing joy that I have ever heard.  He also happens to be the guy who wrote ""All I wanna do is have some fun"" by Sheryl Crow.  Stark juxtaposition."
1,"If you can't measure it, it doesn't exist is bullshit - God  Tell your professor he's full of crap as usual...most are...don't fall for their phd's...look at all the world problems ...we have more so called ""professors than ever..they are the problem because they turn people away from God just like this one does..stay away from their false so called knowledge..they turn people away from Me...they are going to cost you your life."
1,Exactly what I needed to hear...the action part that's another story
1,"Try to visit on my channel, you may like the content

if you love SECLUDEDthumbs_up

Just take a look"
1,"""Blame is a way to discharge pain and discomfort."" That's a game changer! I have been the recipient of too much, completely mystifying and unfounded blame, and generally reacted with hurt feelings and anger. Hopefully now I will react with more empathy. I've doled it out, too, of course so maybe before casting blame I'll consider whatever it is about a situation that makes me uncomfortable and address it (in a perfect world). Thank you for posting."
2,This video probably saved my life.
1,"I watched this at a coworker's suggestion. Its good stuff but she could have saved herself a whole lot of time and effort if she just knew Jesus Christ better. Yeah, I know, let the haters hate. I said the Big C word. We are imperfect sinners but in him we are made perfect enough for His grace. J.C. instructs us to put others first, be humble, not beat ourselves up with our daily shame and sin. Its a shame that academics don't embrace basic tenants of TRUE (key word here) Christianity. The closest she comes to mentioning it is ""spiritual awakening"". But I guess if she did she wouldn't appear to be the paradigm-bending, insightful genius that TED talks fawn all themselves for."
1,Why you don't put subtitles?!? 
1,One of my fav talks. Really relate to things she says. 
1,Forever my favorite Ted Talk. So grateful for coming across this when I did. I can listen to this over & over. red_heart

1,"This is what happened when I gave a speech in my class about vulnerability and shame.

Me: It's so hard for people to talk about what makes them feel shame. However, when we do have the courage to speak up, I find that we all feel shame about similar things. For example, by a show of hands, who here is sexually attracted to amputated limbs, dead bodies, or dead animals? *I raise my hand*

the class: *No one else raises their hand*

Me: Okay, less than half off you."
1,I'm still afraid to show my vulnerable side. I'm still afraid to tell people I never went to college.
1,Can anyone define vulnerability? What are ways to be more vulnerable? Does that only involve sharing how you feel or asking for help?
1,I needed this
1,"Am also here from Netflix too and grateful for the encouragement as I took a courageous step in my life and am now going through all the challenges of negativity, rejection, regret, self doubt.. And am hanging in there waiting for joy that cometh in the morning! Thanks Dr Brene ‘"
1,I think she is a good researcher but that does not always mean that she can understand the causes or even the cures to the things she researaches.  
1,It’s me. I’m the therapist that just sent this to my client
2,"Thank you for sharing this. 
It's resonated with me."
1,NO NONE OF THIS IS TRUE TO HELL WITH YOU BRENE BROWN I NEED A COLD ONE NOW.
1,Came here because of a grown ish episode.
1,*more beautiful that I think you realize
2," Thank you for sharing exactly what I have, all the while, been thinking :)"
2,Excellent job! She has helped me see things differently. The timing was perfect in her life when this took place. God bless her for sharing this with us. I can see how this will help many in their struggles also.
1,Oprah brought me here. :)
1,Hard to believe this talk was 12 years ago yet the context is relevant today. Thank you for sharing. red_heart
1,John Kim (The Angry Therapist) brought me here.
1,yup. this is real.
1,me? angry? not angry: absolutely mortified that people should fall for such crap.
1,"Those same traits can be found in many religious people as well. Like I said, being an atheist doesn't mean anything else than that the person in question doesn't believe in a supernatural deity.

And I do know how the world seems through the mystics eyes, I've been there, and no matter what your mind can conjure up about the world, it pales in comparison to the magnificence of the real world. The world is much larger than you think, and there is a lot more to it as well."
1,She must be a virgo Virgo face_with_tears_of_joy purple_heart fountain_pen page_facing_up
1,"Wow,  used to think I was at the advantage, when I heard about people who ""wear their hearts on their sleeve"" how wrong I was.....this really makes me think... Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all...This talk covered a few issues I think I need to listed to it a few times :)"
1,"Let me tell you what we think about children. They're hardwired for struggle when they get here. And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand, our job is not to say, ""Look at her, she's perfect. My job is just to keep her perfect -- make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh grade."" That's not our job. Our job is to look and say, ""You know what? You're imperfect, and you're wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging."" That's our job.
Show me a generation of kids raised like that, and we'll end the problems, I think, that we see today. We pretend that what we do — doesn't have an effect on people. We do that in our personal lives. We do that corporate -- whether it's a bailout, an oil spill ... a recall. We pretend like what we're doing — doesn't have a huge impact on other people. I would say to companies, this is not our first rodeo, people. We just need you to be authentic and real and say ... ""We're sorry. We'll fix it.""
But there's another way, and I'll leave you with this. This is what I have found: To let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts, even though there's no guarantee -- and that's really hard, and I can tell you as a parent, that's excruciatingly difficult -- to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror, when we're wondering, ""Can I love you this much? Can I believe in this — this passionately? Can I be this fierce about this?"" just to be able to stop and, instead of catastrophizing what might happen, to say, ""I'm just so grateful, because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive.""
And the last, which I think is probably the most important, is to believe that we're enough. Because when we work from a place, I believe, that says, ""I'm enough"" ... then we stop screaming and start listening, we're kinder and gentler to the people around us, and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves.
That's all I have. Thank you."
1,"Oh, baby. Let's go get stoned. This superficial crap makes me cringe.  Please let her not ""help"" anyone for very long, anyway. Adoring a shallow life and pretending it isn't -.  a sort of ""cute"" cult behavior. Like ""Precious Moments"" is to Van Gogh. Phony baloney."
1,"Brene is an interesting speaker. As a Christian I cannot agree with some of her most basic thoughts on shame though.  Christianity seems to have a muchmore nuanced understanding of anthropology and shame than Brene's understanding.  We are made in the image of God but have sin which has distorted that image.  So on our own we can't get rid of our shame.  However, the free gift of Christ frees us from shame and displays and gives us the love of God. 
"
1, it's the other way round now lol face_with_tears_of_joy
1,"damn. ""You're not perfect, you're wired for imperfection, struggle, and vulnerability, but you're still worthy of love."""
1,"The problem with me being vulnerable is that: When I find people I THINK I can trust (and have been friends for months if not at least a year) to reveal that I deal with depression and anxiety....they run away.disappointed_face I feel I can't be vulnerable like that again...and bury the symptoms when they show (If I run late or not able to focus I say I didn't sleep well last night...had a busy day yesterday, ect.).crying_face"
1,So what's the difference between vulnerability and anxiety then?
1,@KommandantKavu can you repeat that in plain English ?! I honestly do not have the faintest idea what you're talking about . 
2,"Will(Want to) apply to myselfmylife, thank you!"
2,"Bold and radical - Brené thank you so much for your work, your dedication and your vulnerability. Thank you."
1,I always have said we are all a little f up .... but that’s ok OK_hand
1,"A friend from church recommended I watch this, and I'm so grateful!!! I'm learning how to be vulnerable and love being in the moment. There is so much peace and understanding to be gained from submitting our shame, guilt, anger, unforgiveness, etc. to Jesus. It's how I finally learned how to love myself and ultimately, other people <3"
2,"I have literally seen this more than 10 times, love it!"
1,"This broad is affiliated with the University of Houston, a crappy school that is rated about #150 in the US. Why would anyone listen to such an intellectually challenged individual? Smart people go to the good universities. Dumb people are forced to affiliate themselves with the losers."
1,"Whenever the mass market appears when somebody delivers a message, look for soothing cliche. Well, here it is with Brene Brown. (People, people who need people, are the luckiest people, in the world. 1964)"
1,"Does anyone else think that it is strange that someone would need counseling because she discovered that vulnerability was essential to happy living?  No offense but to me that sounds like a strange thing to get into a massive depressive episode about.
     Excellent talk, though. One of the best ones I've seen on TED, especially when she mentions politics and religion and about how to tell your kids about the world"
2,"So inspirational and enlightening, love this!!"

1,Very touchinh
1,"I feel sorry for all the people out there, so firmly locked up inside their own prison's that they can't accept the obvious truth for what it is, especially when it is so plainly presented to them. 

R.I.P. capacity to understand things that challenge our world views. "
1,heart_suit
1,"I started with connection. It is why we are here. Under shame and fear is fear of being seen = vulnerability. Long stories, focus groups, journals. Is the fear of not being worthy of connection the key variable. Wholeheartedness? One group had in common courage, compassion and connection?.Whole-hearted is the courage to tell your own story from your heart. Compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others, and they had connection as the result of authenticity and embracing vulnerability. Brene experienced a nervous breakdown / spiritual awakening and went to a therapist who sees therapist (because their BS meter is well-tuned). Vulnerability is the birthplace of joy, creativity, love,  --- I won my life back. We numb vulnerability (dissociation?) but you can't selectively numb emotion, therefore we numb joy, gratitude, grace, love, connection and peace. Let kids struggle while knowing they are worthy of love and belonging and being listened to. Learn to let yourself be seen and love with your whole heart."
1,I am a 1st Year nursing student in the united kingdom in a town of Corby and I would just like to say thankyou for doing this TED talk as this has really opened my eyes not only professionally but personally i wish you all the success in the future
1,"Once you get past her sneaky bragging, vocal fry and pretentiousness, is this worth even listening to? "
1,I'm sorry but this doesn't sound like its the way things really work
1,"""Shame is very easily understood as the fear of disconnection. Is there something about me that if other people know it or see it that I won't be worthy of connection"""
2,"I love Brene Brown and have only heard her speak for 2 hours,  she speaks Truth to Power for us all!  Listen to her,  she only wants the best for all of us,  for our world.  Thank you Brene for being brave,  putting it out there,  for being vulnerable so we can listen to truth,  and learn to love ourselves and others to the fullest! You go girl!  I want to be a part of your club."
1,"I find myself in everything that she says; being afraid of shame, feeling unworthy of belonging, feeling generally emotionally numb etc.. but I honestly think it’s too late for me at this point. I’ve programmed myself to be terrified of so many things that it’s gotten to the point where I can’t even function properly with people. Most days, I’m too afraid to face the world and deal with life. I feel like if I were to allow myself to be vulnerable again, I’d be completely destroyed , which I know isn’t true but I just can’t shake that feeling off no matter how hard I rationalize my thoughts. Everything just seems too much for me to handle."

1,Wow. So powerful. Kicks ya right in the gut.
1,"It must be nice to have the privilege to be able to speak your mind freely without fear of being outcast. I avoid being vulnerable simply because countless times in the past exposing vulnerability has resulted in it being abused. If I were to open myself up to the world I would be destroyed by criticism. I'll keep the private life, thanks."
1,"Yes, she was talking to me. I listened with rapt attention. She touched me .And changed me a little. For the better. Why? Because she personified vulnerability. Sensitivity. Fragility .Perishability. Brene was beautiful."
1,I honestly can not believe she is as popular as she is. This is so slow and all the things she talks about are nothing new. Just read about Buddhism for starters. I recommend checking out Pema Chodron.

1,"The moment we step outside our ""normal"" self we call that state vulnerability/something will change. Vulnerable is a road sign, a sense of a new direction, which could be part of any of the following:
a) (positive, constructive) Rebel Talent (Francesca Gino)
b) Growth / Learning Mindset (Carol Dweck)
c) (the essence of) Leadership
d) (Zen) Beginner Mindset (morning mind)
e) Whenever we practice: ""Think differently"", Paradox thinking, Fuzzy thinking, Inversion thinking 
In a dysfunctional world, to find a safe exit route always add something positive to the negative: ""curious nonconformist"" or add Power to Vulnerability ;) 
If Paradox Thinking makes you smile you have found a way/glimpse/feel of   your authentic/spiritual self."

1,"*long, but pls read*
One little problem with your final theory, if we are completely vulnerable to everybody, knowing humanity as I do, because I too studied psychology extensively in University, people will take that vulnerability, and use it against you, as much as they possibly can for their own personal benefit. I’ve seen it happen time and time again. So respectfully, I completely disagree with the idea of allowing yourself to be vulnerable to everybody, because human beings are not worthy of trust. Human beings are selfish, malicious, advantageous animals that will do anything to make you look bad and make themselves look better. I’ve seen this both personally and professionally more times and I can count. I live by one motto, and one motto only, never trust anyone! It is the only way to protect yourself from being hurt or discredited/damaged. And don’t think that family is any different, because I have seen families tear themselves apart, just because people decided to be open and vulnerable thinking they could trust family, you can’t. Don’t believe me? Study any family with a lot of money, and what happens when the matriarch of that family passes away. You would not believe how vicious, evil, cruel, and greedy people can be, not giving a damn about the loss of a loved one, only caring about money that they do not deserve. That’s the reality, vulnerability is something that needs to be kept under wraps, unless you are absolutely 100% positive that the person you decide to open up to is worthy of your vulnerability, but that is very rare, and very dangerous! Humanity is not worthy of trust, humanity has never, nor shall we ever, learn from our past mistakes, and no matter how hard you try, you cannot change humanity. What’s proposed in this video, frankly is preposterous, because all the traits that make humanity what it is, is so deeply engrained in our psyche, it cannot be undone, and nothing will ever convince me otherwise. Because of this fact, I know we will be direct cause of our own extinction, because of our distrustful, hateful and malicious nature. You may not like hearing this, but deep down, you know that I’m right. For centuries, humanity has been fighting wars over Power and money,  in other words, the need for total control. That need for control is so deeply engraine,  people will do anything to achieve it, even if it means literally destroying the entire planet in the process, and we are well on our way there. It has full, momentum, and nothing can stop it, and while I admire the intention of this video, I have to remain realistic and acknowledge what humanity truly stands for, and it has nothing to do with vulnerability, and everything to do with control. Again, if you don’t believe me, just study history, we’re still fighting wars as I speak, despite hundreds of millions of people being butchered over the centuries. If humanity was truly capable of being changing, growing, and being vulnerable, and others were open to that vulnerability, we would be at a much different place than we are currently, that’s all the proof you need to know that I’m right, although I wish to God, I wasn’t."

1,"Cold shadows whisking back & forth, one lonely soul cries out. This work sucks, but I gotta do it, ""Sir, if you want anything just let me know."" Disconnected selves half wittingly acknowledge by slightly raising their heads, nod, and return to their work. 

How much Human interaction does this one soul crave? You will know by How much she engages when you throw her a crumb: ""is it Hot in here, do you have the AC on? On a dime her being turns on—""You know, I think so too! I'm going to have them do something about that.""

This is the quiet desperation of white america. you see them ashamed to look at you when you see them on a friday night before labor day—it's not that they have to work overtime as much as they would want you to think they work overtime, to cover up for an extreme loneliness that they don't know how quite to reach out for.

You reach out to them, but the only mode of expression they ever known is how to help you out, never to be helped. It's not that I don't want to connect with you, it's just that, as strangers, this is all you are capable of—to engage you i must ask for help so that you can be who you've always been told to be, a person who gives grace rather than one who receives any.

wanting to scream out but having no voice. the heavy armor of ""I'm Fine,"" is too convince to break out of. Years of self discipline practice of calm & control has left you with, well, as you said, years of self discipline of calm & control—how to break out uncontrollably without the assistance of a nervous breakdown? 

we are not perfect, it's ok not to be. we are meant to share our shameful selves in order to connect with others, not fear that people won't want to connect with us once we share. —a reply from one of the vulnerable"
1,I see this everyday in corporate America. People fear exposing who they really are because of potential judgement. It's nothing new really but the punchline is we're all in it together. If you think you don't need to be reminded of these simple truths you may want to take another look at your life.

Here's what sucks about that video. It explicitly defines a troll as anyone who provokes anger from a user out of no purpose but to elicit further dedication to arguing a 'one sided' argument. Yet it also justifies it's claims by stating that 'the internet allows anonymity so you don't have to prove yourself', which is completely unrelated to the definition of the word, or why it shouldn't be used. If this fellow is a troll I can't prove it unless he responds.. "

For me it’s not that easy to listen to it than to other Ted talks, I really had to focus hard. If you feel the same, dont give up! Its really worth it!

1,"Wow, that's a powerful speech that  reads me as a teen."
1,Well that made me cry...
1,vulnerability often seen as a weak point to people that they can hurt you from.. im 31 now and i remember how open i was when i was 21.. acting without a guarantee was so joyful when i was younger.. more i grow old im becoming less joyful but looking for more guarantee.. and this sucks...
1,"lol for those of you saying this is old news and she's got no right to take credit for this and that this is in no way cutting edge.... I don't think you have grasped the notion that you think you're so good at..  there is nothing kind or liberated or generous or secure about taking what this woman says and making it sound unimportant or old.  Not only will this never be old for us as a species, if she wasn't up there saying it for us to watch, why aren't you up there saying it.  knowing something or being taught something is nothing if you cannot find it in yourself to practice and use for the most and best benefit what you have.  This woman isn't just trying to take credit for her research at a meeting of her peers, she's at the forefront putting into practice the thing she found so hard for herself to convey.  Vulnerability.  Numbness.  The desire to hide and close off and self deprecate.  Look at her.  Look at what she's doing for you and for me.  How could you sit here and belittle this women for the huge strength it took for her to go from where you are to this stage at TED so you can judge her and shame her.  I'm glad its her up there telling me these things and not you all who would mangle with your pride and fear of judgment these important and timely words."

anyway i might be in some trouble because my trick to confidence and performing is thinking ""i'm a small part of these peoples world, i will be forgotten so who cares if i screw up? i'm just gonna do what i want and have fun with this."" it usually goes great but sorta goes against alittle of what she said.

i guess i do need to get better with what she's saying about vulnerability."

No disrespect to her whatsoever, I like her, she's a great speaker, like-able etc, I'm worried if this says something about ME, not her..but I'm also just interested in knowing why it hasn't moved me at all!"
1,"I noticed *shame* is usually very hard to overcome by yourself. Don't feel bad if you watched this video or read books about it and don't feel better. I would say *try seeking therapy* (don't be afraid it can get better) don't give up. it's not a quick fix, there is no quick fix. But I assure you can get better with effort and a willingness to be vulnerable."

Wanted to change things up so I searched for this video, which I have initially watched 6 years ago and I remember it was inspiring.  
Watched the whole video, tears run down my face and I realized that I was being too harsh on myself and forgot to be grateful for what I have. 
Thank you Brene, you have taken me out of the dark place and I will rewatch this video for the stormy days to come. Life is not easy but gotta have fun and enjoy it while we can.  If you are struggling like me, I genuinely hope things turn up for you and you can find the light in your life. Best wishes!!!!"
1,"She says things as if their facts but doesn't present any of this research she talked about. She doesn't even explain why shame is bad or why vulnerability I'd good. We're just supposed to accept it. I don't even understand how one can be kind to oneself and, again, she doesn't explain that, either. No substance. Like a religious leader: this is true because I'm telling you it's true. Not good enough."

Rather, we need to understand that no one is or ever has been ""enough,"" that you don't have to be ""enough"" to be worthwhile or loved; I think we have to let go of ""being enough.""  Think about babies--they aren't productive or capable or always ""nice"" or even tidy, yet they are loved.  I think we love them because they are loving and growing and trying to become, and unafraid to show they need us, and I think that's all we need to be...."

1,This woman has so much that is wrong with her assumptions. First we do not all want connection. There are plenty that want at the bottom of their soul to dominate and be superior. This is where people like Genghis khan came from. Secondly just believing you belong doesn't work if people all around you are putting you down for years and years. People can be broken. All of this is just supporting presumptions. Its more about self help entertainment than real content. This is just Opra bullshit

 People need to know that we are safe in vulnerability. 
It's a practice, and we can do it  together."
1,Just finished reading her book Rising Strong. So I decided to come here. Thanks for uploading!
0,Exactly my problem
1,"In our Love and Logic(r) classes, our fundamental message, is that empathy makes conversations which would have been impossible, possible.  Brene Brown takes this many steps further as she dives into the heart of connection, and the personal vulnerability it takes to delivery empathy.  In our class (wplife.org) we teach that our children don't have to be right to give them the gift of loving empathy.  Brene shows us this applies in all of our relationships!"

1,thank you Brené Brown so much for this beautiful talk
1,"i feel so sad for her because it took her so long to be able to look inside and face her own shame and allow herself to be vulnerable. she spent all this time trying to solve the mystery of shame and vulnerability by taking an intellectual route (doing research) instead of taking a hard, painful look at her own insecurities. it is REALLY hard to allow yourself to be vulnerable. im so bad at it ): but i want to improve and this talk really inspired me. "

1,"Summary

Shame: fear of disconnection 
Is there something about me that others know it or see it then I won't be worthy of connection?
(Less you talk about it more you have it)
Eg- ""I am not good enough"" 

What underpins it is Vulnerability i.e the idea that in order for connection to happen we have to allow ourselves to be seen. 

Research: People who had strong sense of love and belonging were those who believed they were worthy of love and belonging (Similarly what keeps us out of connection is our fear that we aren't worthy of connection)
- they had sense of courage  (cor in Latin means heart. Thus original definition of courage was to tell the story of who you are with all your heart)
-courage to be imperfect
-compassion to be kind to be themselves first then others (because we can't practice compassion with other people if we don't treat ourselves kindly)
- they had connection because of authenticity (they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were)
-they embraced vulnerability (they believed what made them vulnerable made them beautiful. It isn't comfortable but they felt it necessary. Willingness to say 'i love you' first. Willingness to give where there are no guarantees. Willingness to invest in relationships that may or may not work out 

You can't selectively numb emotions. When we numb bad feelings, we numb joy/happiness too 

The more afraid we are, the more vulnerable we are, the more afraid we are. That's what politics has become. There is no discussion. We blame. 
Blame: a way to discharge pain and discomfort 

Practice gratitude and joy in moments of terror. Because feeling vulnerable means you are alive. 

Start believing you are enough. You will stop screaming and start listening. You will be kinder and gentler to people around you."
1,"So many visualizations, So many comments. Nice and deep and well organized research work I'm sure. But listen. I'm not the most religious person in the world despite being Catholic. I'm a researcher too. I teach and research in the pharmaceutics field.   Point is you could have saved some years of your research just by going only once to a Catholic mess. You'll be surprised to see/listen that the message is precisely the one you disclose in this talk. Very nice talk, though. But absolutely redundant. The ""state-of.the-art"" in this area is known for at least 2000 years! Let me emphasize, I'm not a religious person.  Well, just my opinion of course and how you could have saved precious years of your life (and some therapy sessions also)."
1,I was always blaming myself and my kids for not being perfect. But my husband always finds the good aspects of me all the time. For me he looks really perfect.    I envied him all the time. Now I know what is the difference between us. Thanks Brene.
2,Brilliant!!
2,but will penelope be okay?
0,Slides are distracting.
1,"I absolutely 100% agree here. WE have to start being more comfortable with discomfort. Go ahead and raise your hand, ask that question, answer that phone call, turn on the news and watch that scary news story. Sure you can block all that away, but it will still be there!
I remember one time, telling my friend that I sat in my home on a sunday and cried for hours watching the news with their anniversary of 9/11 bombings broadcast. She asked me ""it's making you sad, why don't you turn it off?"" I said ""because it's still out there and happening, and yes, I'm sad, but it also feels REAL and I can connect to those people in my own way."" She just didn't understand.
Maybe next time, I'll send out this video instead :-)"

1,"How have I not seen this? Fave part at , what did the people who felt worthy of love and belonging all have in common?
1. The courage to be imperfect 
2. The compassion to be kind to themselves first
3. Connection as a result of authenticity; willingness to let go of who they thought they should be, to be who they really were."
1,And this is something new??
1,Powerful and empowering on a few levels of truth and vulnerability thank you Very much
0,whoever ruined it is FUCKED
1,"Accepting & acknowledging our own fear shame n vulnerability is okay but the speaker has said absolutely nothing about how to deal with the after effects post we show our vulnerability.  How to deal with the impact? The answer lies in my question,  majority of the people HAVE NUMBED THEIR FEELINGS OF THEIR OWN VULNERABILITY,  FEAR SHAME,  SO ITS 95% LIKELY THAT OUR VULNERABILITY WONT BE MET WITH SENSITIVITY OR KINDNESS.  WE'D BE ISOLATED, REJECTED,  TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.  HOW CAN WE EXPOSE OUR OWN VULNERABILITY KNOWING WHAT WOULD BE THE RESPONSE? 
WHAT TO DO WHEN THAT HAPPENS? HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT?"
1,"As Jung would say, people judge because thinking and feeling is more difficult.  Brene is brilliant exactly because as a PHD, she made herself accessible!  Congrats Brene."
1,"chatGPT recommended me this video, so i'll just follow what my teacher says"
1,"I needed to hear this. As loving as I like to think I am, I am not so loving toward myself at times. I have spent a lot of time trying to get past things without going through them, and I realize now that I can't, or shouldn't, do that. We are meant to be vulnerable. Thank you."
1,'That's all I have'
1,"In other words, let your EGO  go away. As long as you have big ego, it will be hard to be vulnerable."
2," the courage to be imperfect

vulnerability
-core of shame, fear, struggle for worthyness
-birthplace of creativity, joy, love

 we cannot ‘selectivly’ numb emotion
 ‘blame’ discribed in the researsh - a way to discharge pain & discomfort
 You’re imperfect, you’re wired for struggle but you’re worthy of love and belonging
 love even when there’s no guarentee
 I’m enough - start listening&kinder and gentler to ourselves and others"
1,"I was recently assigned the Oprah series as well as the TED talk as part of an alternative assignment for a psychology class. I honestly am an academic perfectionist and usually equate ""alternative"" with ""easy cop-out"". I had every intention of completing the research paper that was the main assignment. I also tend to roll my eyes at ""inspirational"" type of talks. 

Then, out of curiosity, I watched the videos. 

I recently went through some very difficult ""find out who your friends are"" times...a premature child who spent NICU time, nearly losing my mother in a sudden and dramatic way right before Mother's Day, and a lot of other small things. Then, this weekend, my ""bury the body"" friend started going through these trying times of her own. 
These videos spoke to me on such a deeply personal level, I knew I had to do the ""easy"" assignment, because easy was the least likely thing for it to be. 
Like the last video said, ""When you hear something and you are ready for it""...that was this moment for me. Thank you, Brene and Oprah for giving me a sudden (and excruciatingly painful) moment of utter clarity."

1,I wish the admin here (tedtalks) took his/her job seriously and facilitate a nice discussion under this wonderful video because it deserves it.  It's not enough to just put it out there and abandon its fate to trolls.
1,That depends for what purpose you use it. Just to get high and escape reality? Then yes. But in my experience weed can show you how vulnerable you really are. It has helped me tremendously over the past year to embrace life and stop numbing myself to the reality of things.
1,too feel this vulnerable means that i'm alive- that got me :')

"
1,"Here are two knowledge objects extracted from the transcript:

### Title: The power of vulnerability in connecting with others

- Fact: Vulnerability is an essential part of human connection and relationships.

- Situation: People often avoid vulnerability out of fear of rejection or judgment. 

- Cause: Shame causes people to feel unworthy of connection.

- Approach: Embracing vulnerability by sharing feelings authentically allows deeper human connection. Being vulnerable requires courage but is necessary for wholehearted living and belonging.

### Title: Numbing vulnerability leads to disconnection

- Fact: It's impossible to selectively numb emotions.

- Situation: Many people attempt to numb feelings like shame, fear and vulnerability.

- Cause: The uncertainty of vulnerability makes people want to numb it.

- Change: Rates of addiction, obesity and debt are high as people numb emotions. 

- Approach: Rather than numbing vulnerability, lean into and accept it as part of being human. This allows experiencing the full range of emotions."
1,"appreciate your reply. It seems to me it's just so hard to find the line between being in touch with one's vulnerability and being unprotected, especially when you're born, raised and living your everyday life in the war zone of ""society"""

When asked by the prosecuting counsel why shohfah-el isreal began calling Joy Morgan ‘darling’ (who Joy Morgan herself explained to shohfah-el isreal that she saw and looked towards him as a sort of father figure) the court was told that it was common practice for shohfah-el isreal to refer to the women of the church as darling."
1,"Throughout our lives we are constantly vulnerable. Vulnerability is an important factor in existence of all things. Without vulnerability the cycle of life is incomplete. In the law of nature vulnerability is the sage that teaches us Courage.

These things are written in natural law. The numbing of emotions against pain is like numbing one's arm from pain. If one's arm cannot feel pain then neither can it feel pleasure. I have known for a long time to turn to Nature, natural law to understand such things. 

The answers we seek live in the organic relationship of existence. Interpersonal relationship with everything is existence itself. We can ignore those relationships in the ignorance of hyper-individualism or we can Embrace existence in all its aspects, without comparing ourselves to pointlessly stress over the irrelevant question whether or not we are Worthy. Neither The Rock, lightning, the wind, or the seed pod worry about Such trivial things and nor should any of us. The universe is content to be the universe and plays its part in the scheme of things as does the rock and the Wind and the wave.

From the air we learn acceptance
From the earth we learn stability
From the water we learn fluidity
From the fire we learn intensity

Learn from natural law. The purpose of natural law is ultimately balance."

1,"@Merkelige take the emotions you have whether they are good or bad and feel them, dont push them down or to the side just bring them up and feel them eventually when you really start to bring up the dirt that you have been shoving down will arise and you will cry and let them go. but you must be okay with feeling those emotions."
1,"re autistic is just that it can cause anxiety 'cos they're crap at it n that bothers them+some are also introverted.re general, introvert and extrovert-The sociable introvert might just be not as introverted as the much less sociable introvert.Sometimes 4 an introvert,social may be just a few people like 3 quiet ppl with common interests, including them, that might be ok for them sometimes.  1-1 might be more pressure unless there's another activity like eating. And >3 might be too many people."
1,Crucial element that makes people remain vulnerable is environment.
1,"""They were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were, which you must do for connection.""  I feel like this makes the assumption who they were was inherently good."

1,"@FXNorm ummm i don't think you're supposed to take that 'if you can't measure it, it doesn't exist' literally.  it's about the scientific method, saying that if you can't quantify it then in terms of academia or scientific peer review then it's not valid.  nobody mentioned god except you."
1,Thanks so much. I don't want to be vulnerable to anyone or anything but now I have to be. UGH! Thanks so much for being transparent.
1,Tried that. Made things even worse somehow...
1,"Very powerful talk. Vulnerability is a topic that isn't talked about a lot, and when it does, it is usually viewed negatively rather than positively. Brene is doing a good job in displaying it in the positive light that it deserves; she is telling the us to stop with the facade, to stop with the impression management, and simply be ourselves. And that is really powerful."
1,This is for North American’s only.
1,This talk was beyond incredible . . . She is a phenomenal person
1,I just want to know who was in the comment being mean to brene??!!! speaking_headspeaking_headspeaking_head
1,"To quote a movie: ""When a man is just born, he is weak and flexible. When he dies, he is hard and insensitive. When a tree is growing, it's tender and pliant. But when it's dry and hard, it dies. Hardness and strength are death's companions. Pliancy and weakness are expressions of the freshness of being. Because what has hardened will never win.""

A person that can show their vulnerability is being ""real"", not shutting themselves out and projecting a facade."
1,"Donald Trump should watch this since he has no shame, and completely believes that he is more worthy than anyone."
1,I am enough
1,"I only got one thing from this. That when we try and numb an emotion that we don't want to deal with, we numb all of our emotions. I can see some truth in this. I don't really understand the purpose of this speech though, was it suppose to be helpful? I feel as though i was just explained deeper meetings of certain emotions while not being given guidance on what to do with them. If i could say ""i'm enough"" and simply start to feel that way.. then this would have been a great speech. Problem - i don't live a wholehearted life, Answer - love yourself and be compassionate, vulnerable and say ""I'm enough"".. well i knew that(for the most part) but i still have no idea how to do either of those..
Well that is just me, i see that some people got a lot out of it, good for them."

2,omg i do not want to watch this !!!!
1,"I love this message so much. To be vulnerable is to be open, to allow your emotions to be set free. To be vulnerable means to be authentic, to remove any masks you are wearing because you don't need to pretend to be someone you are not. You are worthy of love and belongingness, you are worthy of being seen, you are enough, and you matter heart_suitpurple_heartblue_heart"

1,"In a multi-party political system, politics always was about blame. Each party proclaims to be THE one to vote for ... if you want the best government ever. The OTHER party is full of ""EVIL ... CORRUPT ... UNTRUSTWORTHY ... money-grabbing scoundrels."" 

Thankfully the politicians DO police each other ... because the alternative is ... one man in complete power ... which means dictatorship, such as occurs with Putin in Russia, and in many other countries."
1,Are you still married?  I think I'm in love again......May you stay well and happy.

1,“As a result of authenticity”
1,"She didn't mention anything about ""new age"". Emotional vulnerability is as old as we mammals are. She says that people in this highly-medicated day and age, don't embrace vulnerability as they should, because of shame and fear of exile. If TED is obsolete, should we flock to your website? OOps.  "

2,"One of the best explanation,Thank You"
2,"Great job...Thank you for putting a clear, direct and powerful message out to the world that stresses the importance of loving and accepting oneself enough to trust that it is in fact safe to be vulnerable...This is a topic that is near and dear to me and I am grateful when there are more voices spreading such a valuable message. "
1,Any Yes Theory fam here?
1,This woman is absolutely amazing
1,I feel like an idiot again when will I ever learn I do not understand why people would go to such trouble to try and convince me that they were speaking the truth that they really meant that and after a while I had to believe it because I don't want to be cynical and jaded but once again the minute that I actually exhaled and decided to once again go leave someone it's the same old story it was all a game or Ally or something definitely a waste of time but that doesn't help the fact that once again I feel ugly and unwanted and ostracized etc etc and this is why I could come in my house and really have nothing to do with anyone anymore it hurts too much to be involved with anyone even on a friendship level yeah I see all these people having relationships with other people so I realize it must be something about me because it can't be everyone else and not me so I get that I also think that in order to be successful in a relationship or marriage these days a woman really needs to be a total b**** and that's the only way you get respect
1,"This is so powerful, and puts into a speech the thoughts that have swam in my mind for a while now. "
1,This is one of my favorite videos! Lifechanging!
1,i have been working with vulnerability and trying to explain it but it is hard. this talk has helped me in my quest to help people understand that vulnerability is essential if we are to live life to the full; if we are to reach the highs of emotion and realize our potentials. thank you so much for helping me with your easily accessible information. thank you .
1,"First of all, knowingly throwing out half of your data is a pretty big issue. Basically threw out half of people's stories that will never be heard by this research now.

Second, this overlooks how hard it can be for some people to get to a place of vulnerability. How much work it takes to even get to a place when someone can be vulnerable.  

Third, yes, people who don't feel shame still feel empathy, it just manifests in different ways. 

Fourth, shaming shame is terrible, and can cause people to overthink if they are overthinking it, and are less likely to come forward about it to begin with. So, this information actually acts as a deterrent to opening up and sharing stories with one another. We need to embrace stress and difficult feelings if we want to progress forward. 

Fith, the way this goes about talking about ""worthiness"" is like ""oh you mean you haven't found a sense of worth yet?"" Yes, self worth again, is something that isn't so easy for everyone to produce inside of themselves. 

This video should be titled, ""vulnerability, easier said than done.""

I don't want to understand the inner workings of those mentally sound enough to maintain. Those people are privileged enough to have a belief system like that. For some people, ""beliefs"" are talked about like it's a switch anyone can flip. 

Apparently, psychologists aren't focused on looking at those who are struggling the most and finding ways to help them find resolve. It's more interested in telling the stories of those who are already mentally strong enough to master these elements. 

For some, it's a lifelong uphill journey, and this, does not recognize that one bit."
1,"I love how Brené Brown puts it. I have watched her TED talk speech a number of times and I'm always learning something. I can't believe that after so many years of trying to fit in into a denomination, social group, or even family, I have to sacrify my identity to feel accepted and not judge. I came to realized that this is my issue and not of the ones sorrounded by me, so I need to be brave and change my perspective if I want to be happy with myself and the things I want to accomplish in life."
1,My ladc counselor has us watching this
2,Wow. Great talk. I'm not a big fan of Ted Talks but this was worth my time.
1,America.  Looking for the 20 minute fix.      What a bunch of hooey
1,Incredible
1,"Removing the emotions for a moment; telling yourself you are enough when you factually speaking are not, is dangerous. Personally speaking, I have enormous shortcomings that need to be solved, not ignored."
1,I started following you because of my daily -Five minute journal. Thank you for your research and the way you explain things. God Blessrose
1,how can people sit here and watch 20min videos tell me your ways...
1,What if Brene had her own channel with short videos for different kind of situations we face in life and how to better deal with them? I think it would help a lot!
2,"Huge thanks, Brené Brown for this enlightening talk. I have gained so much value!"
2,Love the quotations.
1,Brene  gave us a gift of understanding vulnerability and shame when we found her in 2010. She validated what we new for years. That healing is not only possible but worth doing the work to get! Thanks Brene!
1,"I read How To Stay Sane by The School of Life, and it recommended this Ted Talk."

0,this really fuckin SUCKS
1,This lecture will/is changing my life in every possible way. Thank you so much for sharing.
2,WoW! Thank youpurple_heart
2,Thank you for sharing what you've observed
1,"Reminds me of what the sociologist Donald Levine said in 1985: 'In their quest for precision, social scientists have produced instruments that represent the facts of human life in one-dimensional terms.  They have defined concepts with rigour in order to represent dominant traits and tendencies univocally.  …  For the truth of the matter is that people have mixed feelings and confused options, and are subject to contradictory expectation and outcomes, in every sphere of experience'.  "
2,it's kind of like proving that this isn't a dream
1,"Came from Reddit. Wow. What a message. Thank you, Prof. Brené Brown and Reddit."
1,Lets be more vulnerable in 2014. :D
1,"I am such a fan! I recently talked about this on my Youtube channel and included one of Dr.Brene's quotes! I am also currently reading DARING GREATLY. I just am in awe because I struggle so much with this - being vulnerable. I sabotage every relationship and do not want to continue doing that in my current relationship. Thanks, Dr. Brown!!"
1,"""They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful."" yes"
1," I really thought she said ""ask someone else"" LMAO"
1,"Nice talk and funny. I've heard that before, accepting vulnerability is key to a sense of belonging and worthiness. Maurice Wagner in his 1975 book 'The Sense of Being Somebody"" says we are all feminine in relation to God, which is hard to accept in this day and age. Trying to take control all the time (being masculine) instead of being more receptive and accepting some vulnerability (feminine), can be a problem."

2,"Hm. Very interesting. I'm an upcoming philosopher creating the metaphysics of love (social philosophy dealing with...well, connection), and I came to a very similar conclusion, just without any empirical evidence. To love another, you must love yourself. These wholehearted people know to love themselves as a whole--for all their goods and bads. The ironic thing is that it's a paradox: to be strong you must admit that you are weak. The paradox is a philosopher's bread and butter--it is wisdom."
1,"How do I get in contact with you to make you come to our Town, Malmoe (Malmö) in Sweden, Scandinavia, to engage you to come to us and learn us more about this? I´m in the head of four different areas within social services in Sweden and want to inspire our Town to invite you to come and  talk to us! We are good at social work but we need you´re words in the hart of every social worker to make them more confident and even better in there work for the ones who need us!  Love you´re talk!

2,Love this. Wanted to hear more...
2,"i <3 ted talks, this is great."
2,Wow thank you.  Been kicking this can down my own authentic path and doing my own fighting with this very thing the last two years. I am winning!  I am flowing.  You are awesome!
0,am i on fire?
1,"It was a couple of years ago since I last saw this talk, but all I can say, out of personal experience, is that this is so true. But one should also have a balance, but to find that balance, one has to share and be a bit too vulnerable some times to find out where that line is drawned. Learning by doing is the only way. Good luck Everybody."
2,"My God, this is pure gold! Thank you so much!"
2,What she says is true perfection is overrated anyway
1,Awesome video red_heart
1,“The vulnerability of power”

2,Love how the crowd goes quiet around the 14-minute mark :) Great stuff in this Brene.
1,"@yatter1 Try to think of such language idiosyncrasies as nothing more than a strong accent.  They are peculiar language skills someone learned from their culture, it's petty to call it ""childish and bullshit"".  It's just how they learned to talk.  Does it mean anything, or is that just an irrational prejudice?

Frankly i'm glad she's just talking naturally and authentically without trying to disguise her voice with false pretensions.  As that's kindof the main point of the talk, no?"
1,Grow dev. exp. log. lithium
1,I don’t get it. I may be too numbed emotionally to appreciate what others see in this.
1,that was so priceless in one of her speeches when she was talking about vulnerability how it meant lock and load
1,Teacher clearly need to learn the power of vulnerability. Their deep oppression of children is proof they are shamefully shameless. Not at all like librarians. Librarians care about children. They don't support a compulsory system that distracts kids developing themselves. They are just there when the kids are ready to ask for help. They are there for adults to even... Why is so much money going into schools again? Replace the schools with libraries and parks!
1,i can tell by the atoms
1,"Walking your talk is why I listen and learn from Prof. Brown 
 She's not an overnight success , she's earned her rights of passage."

1,6 million extra views cuz of tik tok lmao
1,Brene Brown. You are a ray of sunlight in this grey and stormy world. Thank you for sharing your music folded_hands.
1,"I was very sceptical about the topic. But, since I’ve heard Seth Godin mentioning her name and the talk, and since he’s very smart, I thought, I’d give it a shot. It’s worth listening to an thinking about it for quite some time, matching it with your experiences about yourself , your life and those around interact with you. You might find something new or interesting."
1,he's the only one i understand
1,Lots to think about!
2,wow....relatable
1,don't tell me it's the people i hate the people
1,Really good talk. But a lot of it is what John Bradshaw was saying over 20 years ago. 
1,A decade of research? You’re either forgetting many very important points or you still have a lot to learn ‘Dr’ Brown.
1,She's describing the human trait of being anti-fragile and dressing it up in SJW terminology. Too bad she's a forerunner to the SJW plague that is destroying society today.
1,but what if youre really NOT enough?
1,"Brené Brown, you seriously had me utterly engrossed in this excellent analysis of how our vulnerabilities unavoidably shape us. Sheer brilliance and an A+++ for your years long efforts in bringing it all together into such a truly great presentation."
1,"Shame: the fear of disconnection; is there something about me that if other people know it or see it that I won't be worthy of connection.
Shame: I'm not good (________) enough.
Underpinned by excruciating vulnerabilty-- in order for connection to happen we have to allow ourself to be seen, really seen.
... a sense of worthiness, worthy of love and belonging... authenticity; courage to be imperfect; fully embraced vulnerability (necessary, made them beautiful)-- say ""I love you first"", do something without gaurantees.

Poor and inefficient ways we currently use to deal with vulnerability: We numb. We make the uncertain, certain. We perfect. We pretend.
Another way: Let ourselves be seen, deeply, vulnerably; Love with our whole hearts despite there being no guarantee; Practice gratitude and joy;  I am enough."
1,Sounds like horrible advice
1,"I find it pervert when one raises and tell the crowd (some individuals even take notes as the speaker performs) how to think and behave. Those “modern prophets” usually rely on a variety of sophists that may put their [credulous, impressionnable, unconfident, thirsty for heroes/guides/mentors/symboles] audience to shame e.g. you can believe (pay) me since I have 3 degrees in sociology and that I had 10 years experience teaching at the university, etc.

My advice: don’t give up on your critical sense and be eager for greater truths. Now should I be ashamed ? I'm from the pit arena abused and condemned by the born upper class."
2,"I love this video, thanks for posting it. I'm a proud man, and is gonna take me some time to be fully vulnerable, but life is short to not let love in. smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes"
2,I love this video so much... thank you fro sharing!
1,"If this woman's understanding and insight on human connection was practiced by all of humanity, we might have a shot at world peace. I am grateful she dedicated her life to making the world a better place."
1,"I have listened to this video many times.
False analyses and a dominant information data, everything sounds convincing with the perception that something has really been learned, but believe me, these data and information are wrong.
The more cowardly you are, the more fragile you are. Do you believe this?
The truth is; the more honest and sincere you are, the more fragile you are.

No device to measure sincerity and honesty has ever been discovered.
There are things in your life that cannot be measured and we live with them.
Thank you"
1,"It's even so hard to describe my feelings, which are much more than a word ""powerful"". Being vulnerable really does not mean being week at all, it means ""the most special strength"". This is such another reason to keep on living this life, thank you so much. :)."
1,She takes too long to get to the point. This talk could have been done in 10 mins. Great in theory but in practice not so. Some good points.
1,"Seems like useful advice for some but not based on any hard psychological evidence, rather her personal experience and interpretations."
2,Thank you
1,This is the best TED talk I've ever seen.

1,pleasee translate to spanish I didn't understand many things :C but I really like these videos
1,<SMACK>
1,Anyone notice after most jokes she says 'um' quickly?
1,"The problem is... that's redundancy. The people who believe they're worthy of love and belonging have a strong sense of love and belonging exactly because they have experienced love and belonging, and therefore, obviously, it became something normal for them. The people who struggle, are people who were experiencing competitive or repressive situations from an early age. It's quite obvious that confident people are confident because they grew up among people who cared for them, who trained them, who empowered them, loved them, etc. Now, a lot of people are ""cared for"" in a negative way. Like for example those toddler pageants, where little girls are ""cared for"" and ""loved"", but are actually being put in a highly competitive environment, and being forcefully transformed into something they actually ARE NOT, and then this fictional version (which is loved) becomes the ""right version"" of the person, and the real person will always be shameful, ugly, unwanted, and then constantly struggling to be the fake, improved version of themselves. Many people are treated in similar ways, but not so evidently. But kids have to ""be a good kid"", they should be polite, should study, get good grades, go to bed early, eat their vegetables, etc etc. Even if you are a great kid, it only takes one adult to have another preferred kid (even if it's one with worse qualities overall) and who tries to ""correct you"" to be like ""the favorite"", to make you feel ""wrong"". It's quite common to see many artists or successful people to tell stories about people who put them down, criticize them, said they were untalented, stupid, dumb, or whatever. And then you may have ugly, dumb, incompetent, worthless people, who are raised in a more calm and protected environment, and actually are happy and loved by their parents and other fat ugly and dumb people."

1, Courage n Bravery are different.
1,"10 years later and I find this speech  so emotional. Tears came out unexpectedly. I guess the power of authenticity and vulnerability are timeless. 
 Thank you for uploading."
1,This is spectacular!
1,"The sad part is - she IS a storyteller, not a scientist for sure. No data, no theory, no evidence, just a bunch of inspirational stories.

That is not how science works, anything else, but science."
1,I have never needed to hear something as much as I needed to hear this. I am so grateful that someone turned me to this.
1,Just read the book for professional development and it has helped me so much!
1,"Thanks so much Brene. So inspiring!! I love the line ""In order to create connection, we need to allow ourselves to be seen"". This video inspired me to make my own video about Vulnerability and having deeper converations. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42tVQcFLHZM"

1,"Not to get too metaphysical on you, but I actually believe that the cutting edge of evolution is on the front of empathy, that from animals necessarily obsessed with rather myopic self-concern, we (some of us, anyway) are groping our way toward a less limited perspective, not necessarily group mind, but group feeling, at least, eventually extending to all creatures on this planet, present and future. It's what the planet needs, if life is to continue..."

1,This TedTalk made me cry. I fight vulnerability so much. Something to work on.
1,Can anyone with conclude what she is saying?
1,This is one powerful talk! Brene Brown is amazing with her honesty and someone I would want as a friend. 
1,"the people who dislike this talk are the least vulnerable, most guarded, most afraid, most  fooled by our society's message of ""be perfect!"" "

It reminded me ""why"" I do what I do and ""why"" failure is not an end but can be used as a beginning.  Thank you!! Thank you!!"

2,Really inspiring and so true. Thank you.
2,"In actuality vulnerability is stronger than being 'numb' (which people like that think they're superior) because vulnerable folk have the strength to love and take a risk, because they can take the pain."
1,I love her way of story telling! Definitely grabbing her book after watching this
1,"I was shocked at her smugness and narcissism during Lori Santos' ""the happiness lab"" podcast. So disappointing"
1, so true abouts politics...
1,So is she saying vulnerability is what we need to live?
1,Chatgpt
1,"Each time I come back to see this video, I learn something new."
2,Grazie. Thank you for sharing this wisdom
1,can someone explain to me what s vulnrability please ? i m not an english expert .
1,"Wow, is all I can say! This brought tears as you as you have hit the nail on the head. I felt it at my core."
1,For me the power in my vulnerability is that it allows me to have no expectation in or on any given matter. I am able to experience every aspect of every given moment or beat of every situation and gain insight into the matter at hand. Those insights that I gain aren't for the present moment they become answers to a past situation and an understanding of not only myself but others that I'm engaged with through out this vibrational time space reality. Being vulnerable allows me to experience gratitude on a level beyond any earthly comprehension. It allows me to get unto my god conscious state of mind and receive and experience my human life from a non judgemental perspective either towards myself or others.
1,"The thing I want to mention from own experience about the point of vulnerability indicating beauty is that that vulnerability can make you get hurt so badly that the beauty withers. It is extremely difficult to cripple something in yourself in order to not have it be killed. ... But if you don't do it, others might do it for you. Energy fields come in contact and influence each other. People have problems because they once didn't and then they got overwhelmed.
My impulse to express myself passionately and wholeheartedly led to experiences that mostly killed that impulse, and it's not something you can just not let happen. That's the whole unpopular point of being vulnerable which I tnink you wanted to convey yourself: It's not a trick to dominate hardships. You have to be able to fail and get up again.
Oh and then there's that thing with society being quick to label people who fully give into the ups and downs as ""bipolar"" and trying to fight it. A person with an open heart becomes an enemy of those who hate themselves for their lack of courage of doing the same but don't want to be reminded of it.
There's often at least a bit of romanticizing in people giving TED Talks because they have succeeded with their strategy to the point where they can give TED Talks. There's a lot of ""This is my observation, it looks true for me, so it must be universal law, just heed this"". Vulnerability has power when you can afford it. Sometimes shielding yourself can be powerful. There's no universal recipe. The situation at hand needs to be considered. It is said that success is about how well we relate to people around us. So if you are in a bad place and want to relate, you gotta adapt or you will be confronted with lots of hostility.
Concepts like ""love yourself first"" or ""your critics don't count"" are in the same way two-edged swords, because their impact depends on the character of the person you tell them to. Health is about balance, and one person's medicine is another person's poison. Just throwing it out there might do roughly equal amounts of heal and harm, or maybe even more harm. Who could say?
I can relate to the therapists-who-see-therapists though and their bullshit-meter being alright. The better therapists are less available because of their popularity and the experience I have made with more easily available ones is tons of projection of own issues on their part and me wondering how they ever managed to be allowed to work as therapists and whether their job serves them as a denial mechanism.
When you said to your low-BS therapist ""OMG, it's gonna suck!"" I imagined Morpheus going ""Yeees."""
1,I’d call her a heuristic injector.
1,"Great research, story, and the essence of the work we do in our coaching. "

0,Why are you so angry? If this is so irelevant why bother? 
1,I have watched this talk several times and every time I love it more. Brené Brown is so brave an inspiring!!! I admire her very much!! Many valuable lessons form her talks and books. We are blessed to have you with us Brené!! All the best for you!! Keep it up!!!
1,"I watched this with my now ex. It still taught us a lot. We didn't have that connection or comprehended this in the same way. That said, it made things so much easier/smoother/peaceful, making that transition to go back out on our  own , without any bulshit. I wish I knew more and or accepted the reality of vunerability at a younger age! Hindsight lol"
1,"show me a woman  who can sit down with a man in vulnerability and fear, and who doesn't later (or immediately) use this to her advantage in some capacity, and *i'll* show you a woman who *actually* loves her man.
(i.e doesn't see him  (consciously or unconsciously) as chattel)

that said, amazing talk  ..this is what TED should be, and continue to be -- thought provocation, not thought indoctrination"
1,you can't have a question without words
1,"Hm. I'd heard a lot of recommendations for this talk. It's okay, I guess, but she really isn't saying much. I'm honestly wondering why this went viral. Are that many people really at such a remedial level of insight that the these are revelations? Also, her description of her own research-oriented path to these very basic insights sounded kind of silly to me. Maybe what she researched was the market for selling books."
1,"Me me me, I just heard about her yesterday...she is amazing shame she doesn't have her own youtube channel"
1,Yes I was thinking about it and I suppose this is an introduction to mindfulness etc to some people who haven't ever seen or heard about it. I just find the Buddhists etc to be much more interesting and enlightened and they tend to have more practical guidance etc. 
1,always come back here from time to time because... well... it's necessary.
1,What about air...?
1,Simply incredible. One of the best TED talks.
1,I just noticed that most of poeple who left comments on this video are women.
1,"Actually in her book Daring Greatly she speaks about how at first in her research she did a big injustice to men by not even including them in her research and when she did include them in her research, she learned that men struggle with these issues too because the ""shame tape"" they hear their whole lives is ""don't be a p***y"" and how this shapes men's lives in so many ways. Very interesting. "
2,"True vulnerability is courage to say ""I love you"" first. To open your heart, there is no guarantee that you will be accepted or loved."
1,Ok.. Maybe im the only one not swooning over this... She is not saying anything that hasnt been said before.
1,"My old therapist recommend this a couple years ago, and last month my current therapist gave me homework to watch this video. I still haven’t learned how to be vulnerable woman_facepalming_medium-dark_skin_tone"
1,"Actually, I totally agree with this.  I think our emotional center, the place from which we experience ALL emotions is what we are targetting when we numb.  We leave ourselves inept to feel the things we are desperate to feel when we try to shut off the things we are desperate not to feel."
1,This video was uploaded in 2011 & I am here watching it in Nov 2019.
1,"I was born decades ago with a really great musical ear,  with exceptional eyesight , i was athletic and handsome.  I still retain a lot and walk with  confidence .  When i watched this video i was momentarily distracted by the subtitles, when it said ''laughter'' etc.   At that moment i felt great appreciation for those who could watch this but could not hear ,  how they watch it and can still enjoy it by reading the subtitles, not hearing laughter but they can imagine the audience laughing at what she said.  
    I've been blessed so much in my life , despite many of my own problems over the years.  I think it is a great thing to add subtitles for those who cannot hear.  I can't imagine what that life is like,  and it's good that we are connected with eachother in positive ways."

1,I had to hide my vulnerability since I was a child. I grew up with a Narc mom. Narcs believe vulnerability is for the weak. I have always struggled with feeling like I am enough and worthy of love. Maybe one day I will get it.

1,"Me: Melfi told me watch this.
some friend: Melfi who;
Me: Tony soprano's therapist"
1,i’m here because the grownish episode.
1,"A. K, I should have given you a hugface_blowing_a_kiss"
1,I'm always worried that state of spiritual enlightenment conflicts with the pursuit of self improvement.
1,"I think in the UK, the professional mental health services have lost their way. Designed for matters of the mind, how can so many people treat patients like their minds don’t matter."
1,"I have loved from a place of vulnerability to no avail but I was ripped to pieces each time left with nothing but shame and guilt to not being able to cope with life skills I never learned these necessary survival skills I was born into circumstances that did not give me the opportunity. Thus life was only an experience of   anger rage resentfulness  loathing
jealousy they were my frame of reference they were   my instant reaction I have no emotional regulation skills and this would lead to future suffering . Being  a 
perfectionist was my redemption  I did things to the point of losing myself to them but I did that dance 

over and over.  I have worked sooo hard obeyed all the rules of
dad  laid out he held in his hands full control of my identity that wasn't determined nor was I ever given valve respect acceptance to explore it. 
I loved to  fault it and it cost me because I could of never imagined myself or the idea of what people can do to you once their done using you and ohhh they make it a point it was you who needed them and because you haven't had the time to establish ""THE YOU"" as your power of love INYOUR HANDS courage self worth sense of belonging  which is because you had no connection to the outside world so you had no one on evid
I personally think depression stems from not being given a chance to be your true self = your identity 
It haunts you that's actually the emptiness you feel inside you. The numbness to your own body making it impossible to identify with anything or person in your environment.  inability to cope with feelings which all come from the perceptions alluded to by caregivers in the most impressionable vulnerable sensitive states in a humans life (childhood)  unless your run into the people environments situations that will guide you in understanding the what why  of your suffering and how to cope with the vital factor of compassion kindness belonging worthiness purpose you stay stuck 
But BRENE BROWN my ability to love wholehearted is  what kept me alive to this date
I watched everything fall apart in my life up to this very day. I now have nothing to lose 
Maybe vulnerability can  have the reigns now because I need it to help me find myself hence it is not something  others can show you when you don't know yourself  Your  scared you will  fail if you attempt something that means a lot to you or you don't have what it takes (perfectionism )
So basically it's messy it's requires faith forgiveness gratitude and the ability to see we are all connected all struggling but possibilities opportunity
OMG (The gifts of imperfectionface_with_peeking_eye)  I was just writing what came to me  and this realization happens!!"
1,My therapist definitely told me to watch this grinning_squinting_face
2,science worships matter
1,"Was fine until that last photo. ""I am enough"" had me crying. Thank you for this video. Think I need to go watch Shame next. I recently told someone I just wished I could shut off all the emotional feelings that makes one cry. To forget all the bad that has ever happened and only have a heart of that had no fear. Being vulnerable has always crippled me, but I think I'm going to try focusing more on why I feel this way and the steps to overcoming this. I've been so fearful of my own future and getting out there and starting that next step in my life for fear of rejection. Wondering if I was smart enough or even good enough for what I want to do. Thank you again for this video."
2,wish i hava professor like her
1,"This woman is amazing, she's kind of living the dream. I mean, let's be honest. No one wants to do nothing and have everything for a lifetime. But everyone wants to understand themselves. You know it's true, if you deny it, that's bullshit. You want to know what's going on. Everyone does. I mean, her job is amazing."
2,"love these talks, i learn so much :)"
1,My therapist brought me here lol grinning_squinting_face
1,So nobody is real anymore??? So everybody pretend??? To find out now that this is how we all suppose to think and live ! I don’t understand
1,"Brought me to tears. I wish I could have known this years ago. So many ah-ha moments. Thank you, thank you for sharing! I am absolutely inspired. ""You can't only numb the bad stuff"" no more avoidance muffins for me..."
2,Thank you for this one...
1,I’ve watched this at different points in my life & I’m still receiving gifts from her awareness; brilliance.
1,My therapist told me to watch this as this weeks homework LMAOloudly_crying_face
1,"So, after the spiritual awakening,  she said ""I'm not going to surrender myself to vulnerability."" Then begins the project of inscribing vulnerability as a productive tool in the maintenance of the status quo; it can facilitate the ability of oil companies to fix their oil spills.  And how is believing that ""we're enough"" related to vulnerability? Something seems strange."
2,I cried and laugh from here. Thanks!!!!!
2,Found this from the Netflix documentary grand army and I love it purple_heart
2,Thank you...Thank you! Well Wishes for you and yours. orange_heartorange_heartorange_heart
2,I love this so much. One of the best :)
1,"A warrior is not about absolute imperviousness, unchanging even with faults but about absolute vulnerability, to improve oneself while facing weaknesses."
1,Sounds a little bit like Buddhism.
1,"This TedTalk video is a must watch for the entire dental office team since patients routinely complain that their last dental office talked down to them and showed them very little empathy for their dental problems. I wish everyone practicing dentistry would watch this video. Howard Farran DDS, MBA"
1,"I fully admire this speech and I can't agree with her more.
The problem is, being enough doesn't pay us. Being enough is not really enough. So I believe Mr@t3tsuyaguy1 made the point clearer. Let's embrace our vulnerability or imperfectness and let's live. Sure we'll suffer but we're not alone. (Sorry I'm making a gay little speech lol)"
1,"Also lack of connection is prevalent in people with addictions.....  7 billion people, no one should feel alone. I hobestly am losing faith."
1,"Guys! I think this message is hugely misguided for men! Its primarily addressed towards the healing of feminine being. It doesn't address the true needs of men.

Its true that ""being seen as weak"" is the fear of men but a woman will never understand how visceral it is for a man and how much it can drive him.

For men, being vulnerable is NOT about allowing to be seen as imperfect - that's for women. For men, vulnerability is about choosing  to strengthen those aspects of himself that are currently weak.. He may NEVER talk about it - and that's ok. But, the very action of a man, who feels weak and scared, yet chooses to strengthen IS true vulnerability for man.

Equally, men are designed to be brothers. We understand each other and its in our blood to give strength to our brother when he needs it and never expose or betray him in his weakness..

Women may never fully understand all this about us and that's ok. But, I hope men here continue to focus on healing and strengthening themselves cuz trust me - your life is indeed tough and we only have each other and God mostly"
1,"If there's anything that I've learned with my first relationship is that all that she said is true. It's interesting, having been vulnerable, leaves me with no regrets. "
1,how can you call her pretentious? The woman talks about breaking down and going to therapy... seems pretty honest and humble to me.
0,this reality SUCKS
2,"Inspirational.  Life-changing.  In a word, Brilliant!  Thank you, Ms. Brown."
1,watch any of Henri Nouwen on youtube and you find exactly the same
2,Interesting insight
2,"It's a bit of bullshit, perfection and control are the best way for greatness!"
1,"Up until 24 hours ago, before I watched this video I made fun of people who loved so recklessly and willingly gave into the vulnerability in order to experience something beautiful. And I know now that that judgement came from a place of shame. It came from a place that had been hurt and rejected and not chosen multiple times by multiple people. It came from a voice that  told itself to harden and be strong and don't let people in anymore, be you're own happiness, your own love, don't be weak or vulnerable to men because that'll get you hurt. But this Ted Talk changed my life. It changed my perception. And although it took some brutal self analysis and judgement, I instantly felt a sense of relief as she spoke of how it's okay, NECESSARY even to let that in, to live your life with vulnerability  and compassion and boundaries so thank you. You probably saved my life and future college career."
1,"“Is there something about me that if other people know it or see it, I won’t be worthy of connection”

1,"Did she just assume religion as a whole to be a failure because of the imperfection of religious people? ""Uncertainty and vulnerability becomes certainty and arrogance?"" 

I know there are some people who are not respectful with their beliefs, both secular and non-secular. I know people that are nasty with other personal convictions. BUT to generalize all religion as a means to demonstrate arrogant responses from vulnerability is impolite and ignorant. 

I believe that Jesus loves us, and His Father, who made heavens and earth has all authority. I believe that it is good for us to live with that in perspective, and to love others and love God, and his Holy Bible. It is all a mystery to me, and it is by faith I believe these things.

Does that make ALL those who also believes in what I believe, vulnerable, and therefore, arrogant and impolite.... ""Youre Right, Im Wrong?"" (Also, why use the angry man for the demonstration?)

Let me know what all yall think :)"
1, Situations where you are vulnerable
1,She gave a gift to the world with this talk.
1,"And we're just gonna keep suffering as long as we're attached to our egoic identities. In 20 minutes of daily meditation you can dig even deeper on this topic, from your own source."
0,can you just give me a fucking hint?
1,I watch this one time every day.
1,@ktallingham They do teach this in churches (non legalistic ones)  her theory is the essence of Christ's teaching.
1,"Thank you so much for this.  I am struggling right now with what one might call a ""midlife crisis"" and the worst part about it is feeling such vulnerability.  Your words have such resonance for me, and I really needed to hear them today.  I am enough."
0,Totally annoying.
2,Lovely.
1,"I can't believe this hideous accent made its way into higher learning those spoiled rich girls graduated college and now go around talking like this and giving lectures with the ""I was like & he was like"" SAD"
1,I wish I could speak to this woman for couple of hours. As I'm not quite sure which way to go.
0,decades of boringness
1,Metaxy. The separation that connects. Plato; Simone Weil.
1,"Talks a lot, but says little. ...I would have walked out 10 min into the nothingness.  
"
1,"No what you are speaking of would lack a conscious, thus psychopathic!
"
1,I've never had chills and tears with a talk before.
1,I love this talk! So important in today's society. We can stop numbing ourselves afraid of being vulnerable. It's amazing when someone is fearless of showing who they are and how they feel. And then to be open to learn and grow from the experiences
1,"My psych counselor brought me here. I am at the bottom of the emotional scale (my words, not my counselors) and that realization sucks. Lot of work to do."
1,My therapist told me to read the book and I didn't
1,MJ Harris pmooooo 2 youuu girlll wooooo preach it clapping_handsclapping_handskiss_mark loved every single thing you said
2,LOL that's part of the joke
1,"In the company I work for, they call "" Areas of opportunity "" to the mistakes I make... Jejejeje..."
1,omg that was amazing
1,Too many words before she gets to the point....
1,"There is no universal definition of what an atheist is like as a person; the only thing the word defines is our lack of belief in the supernatural.

This whole subject is quite interesting, and a lot more complicated than you think. The real world is quite marvelous, and trying to explain things with the presence of a god just dilutes the picture. Religious people often can't comprehend just how magnificent this world is with all it's wonders; to them it's merely God. To us it's so much more."
1,My acting Coach @baronbrown suggested I watch this. So glad she did (Elaine Williams)
1,"I’ve watched this for 13650 times, it’s my therapy nowface_holding_back_tears"
1,I needed to hear this Ted Talk today!
1,"If you don't like this video, read her book ""Daring Greatly""
If you don't like her book...c'mon, admit it...you're just a troll..."
0,All the dislikes must be from scared folks.
0,I came here to read the hate comments after watching her Netflix special. No hate here!
1,Nietsczhe said these 150 years ago :P
1,"I really do appreciate what Brene is saying in this talk and I agree with her 100%. However, what I have noticed with her talks and interviews (and many other TED talks) is that little to no attention is paid to addressing the fact that some people are unable to be vulnerable without first engaging in some involved therapeutic process to address their attachment issues. I would love to take that leap of faith to just be vulnerable but until I get a bit further in my therapy vulnerability actually feels physically threatening to me."
1,I was referred by a tik-tokker and it's worth listening to.
1,Brene Brown is an amazing speaker!
1,"Lovely video , has me thinking about a lot of things . Some of your thoughts hit home ...especially the vulnerability issue .."
1,her face and her body just didn't fit
1,"Just came across Brene Brown 02Feb2022 on a mention of Spotify's Joe Rogan issue.
Brene's fame apparently took off after this 2010 TED talk. It seems to have resonated largely because of the comforting words 'be vulnerable, don't blame, you are worthy.""
Rather than any clear insights on how to convince yourself of these things. 
She gives zero attention to the importance of learning science literacy and critical thinking (SLCT)--which vastly increase the chance one will stay convinced of even the most loving family upbringing. 

This lack of specificity, and lack of outlining the sequence and interdependency between SLCT and worthiness, renders her comforting sounding conclusions little more than just that.

 ""Let ourselves...love with our whole hearts even though there's no guarantee""
Basically makes sense--but again enough vagueness to drive a truck of misinterpretation through.
More specifically: it's a benefits/cost ratio and expected value thing--like all endeavors in life. 
There are 4 parameters in expected value E:
Pgain = probability of gain
Vgain = value of gain
similarly for loss
E = (probability times value)gain + (probability times value)loss

Then recognize that the gain term can be greater than the loss term thus making E positive, thus a gamble worth taking.  
Instead, her comforting but vague words are easily misinterpreted as just jump into a love affair, without trying to estimate the 4 parameters.

She even says right after ""I can tell you as a parent it's excruciatingly difficult""  
Well yes, when you're this vague:  If you don't define the importance of SLCT and don't define expected value, of course you're going to make the problem much harder.

It's safe to say many have come away from her talk thinking that just repeating ""I am worthy"" is the answer. 
Combining her ideas with SLCT would be much more powerful than the talk alone."
1,"Except that you can't have connection with something that doesn't exist. If religion was a new phenomenon, it would be treated as a mental sickness; a delusional belief system. It's the connection to other human beings that we need; not a deluded belief in something that isn't there.

Then again, I agree that a belief in a loving god is a lot better than some alcohol addiction, just as long as it doesn't bring with it a ton of other harmful beliefs, like religion does."
2,"I am, and I'm from Netflix! Love it!"
1,Just had a dating experience that really opened my eyes to this. Felt like a weight lifted from me regardless of the outcome
1,"CONNECTION 

excruciate vulnerability:
• shame
  ""I'm not good enough"" 
• fear
  ""not worthy of connection""

worthiness
   ""believe your worth""

• what do these people have in common?
— whole-hearted.
— courage, compassion, treat yourself kindly, authentic, who you really are
— embrace vulnerability (willingness to say i love you first, do something with no guarantees, invest in a relationship that may not/may work out)

breakdown/spiritual awakening
— it is what it is 

we numb vulnerability = we numb everything 
— you cant numb emotions

we make the uncertain certain
— don't blame

we perfect
— we are not perfect, but we are worthy of love

we pretend
— be authentic and real

""to let ourselves be seen, love with our whole heart""

""i am enough"" 

""stop screaming and start listening"""
1,"The beauty in this women is beyond me right now. 

Whenever I learn something so valuable from a anyone, it reveals their beauty to me.
THANK YOU FOR SHARING!!!! "
1,This talk is a must-watch for anyone who considers themselves a creative person. Brené Brown's words on vulnerability and creativity are so powerful and resonate deeply with me
1,This is 12 years ago?
1,So what is so funny is what I'd like to know
1,"Her book The Gifts of Imperfection"" dives deeply into this.  Painful, eye-opening and wonderful."
1,can't believe this video actually made me cry... crying_face
1,"This is a well talked out speech but not fully backed up with scientific reasoning. In order for her to prove this point fully, she would have to use cross-sectional designs for an ongoing period of more than 30 years. Although this is persuasive, it doesn't qualify for everyone. People are vastly different in their personality traits through many different connections and divergences. "
1,This makes me feel I need more wine. This is is so obvious and basic.  No we don't numb vulnerability!?
1,Anybody else just get triggered by this talk?? I vulnerable. Im TOO vulnerable. It doesnt take courage for me. My vulnerability DOES THE OPPOSITE.
1,LOL...sparkles awesome... #virgomoon Virgo #siderealastrology #actualplacements

Congrats for you amazing autenticity"
1,"You telly made me see things more clearly, Thank you"
1,"The most-thought provoking Ted talk I've ever watched. I really needed to watch this, made me rethink my approach towards Life."
1,"Well, in my case it usually turns out to be ""margaritas ante porcos"" situation."
1,Whew.
1,I’m not the only one whose psychologist told me to watch this clearly!! Amazing x
1,What colour is her shirt
2,"We need justice, grow to be a person of integrity and wisdom; love each other"
1,"After 8 years, this talk is still so powerful and necessary."
1,"I came here from the five minute journal :) , anyone else?"
1,it's a 20 min talk and she doesn't get to the subject after 15 minutes!
1,"Great assessment of what everyone ""should"" perceive as what  being human really IS in their own understanding of Whom they, as humans, ARE in the realness of inner self. Humans in general, relate to the outer reactive nature of their emotional tenancies as being who they are at their core of identity when this is but illusion since it is totally artificial in its structure. A structure based on upbringing and external influences which create stereotypical responses to situational environments in which they habituate themselves to comply with.  The real nature of their individuality at the underlying truthfulness level of their inner felt emotion is suppressed and as pointed out by Brene Brown, Numbed down... This programmed response triggers the shame, fear, disconnection and lack of love or joy. There results a self acceptance of something they believe they should be rather than who or what they really are at core value, and from this belief stems the disconnection with the essence of their own humanity since they cast aside their own fundamental selves as being unacceptable."
0,The underlying cause of the majority of pain and suffering comes from our value system.
1,Does anyone know if the book is available in printed form. My Husband has ask for it and I can absolutely not find it. My Husband will be horrible to me if I don't find this.
1,I watched her on Netflix so I am here smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes
2,Thank you for this <3
2,i had to watch this is rehab but like this was my fav of the vids they showed cus she’s so logical and down to earth I love her
1,"Love u Berne’ however I have to leave you because you don’t believe in free speech as per you stance of wanting to pull your material from Spotify because of Joe Rogan, who is a truth teller. See ya. What a turn off that you had to become political and alienate half the country. Get woke go broke!"
0,"Boring ,
Really boring !"
1,I hate being vulnerable but otherwise I am not sure if I'd still be here. Thank you TED and Brene.
1,"On Netflix
Brene Brown: The Call to Courage"
1,A good talk to come back to.
2,really needed this kind of talk ... god bless you
1,you just have to look extra close
1,"I wasn’t initially aware of this video before I took an action for vulnerability. For May Mental Health Awareness Month, I decided to share my mental health story and what it’s like living with bipolar disorder. I shared it on all my social media and it was so scary. On the surface, it might seem like I was the perfect student, straight A’s, student government leader, president of an organization, internship experience, student worker, well-liked/have many “friends.” But on the inside I struggled deeply to connect with this image I made of myself. People always told me that I looked like I had everything together. But beneath all of it, it was like nothing in my life seemed to match up. So I opened up to people and am currently still struggling with vulnerability. It’s not something you see everyday or take part of. I also confessed my feelings to someone recently. I think the step of vulnerability leads to more options. But right now I feel like I’m in the middle stage where it’s still scary and you don’t know what’s going to happen. Overall, I can’t say it’s quite worth it yet because I’m having this turmoil of emotions, but once I figure it out, I think it’ll be okay. 

Also if you want to read my mental health personal piece, I’ll link it. Thank you.

1,"People who dont believe theyre worthy of love or belonging feel that way because it's been lacking their whole lives while they see everyone else surrounded by love and acceptance. They internalize this and  figure they must not worthy of it or theyre lacking something that everyone else has which is preventing them from belonging. Thats what it comes down to. Someone who feels theyre worthy of all the love and acceptance they're receiving have always been receiving that love, they don't know anything else."
2,Love youu
1,"Wow.. thank for you and this talk.. you have just made sense of so much that I have been unable to comprehend or understand within myself. Thank you Brene, my sincerest gratitude to you xx"
1,More of the world should see this and start making it an even more beautiful place.
2,Great message
2,"Beautiful and so true, thank you :)"
2,Thank you Brene Brown
2,"My gosh thank you, THANK YOU. The idea I always thought weak. Vulnerability."
1,"..one of he best talks I've ever seen on TED......it confirmed all that I came to understand.....I can't even begin to describe the feeling of joy & relief happening simultaneously,after watching this ..world would be another place,if peole came to understand this..
thank you
"
1,I think it’s safe to say that all human beings could benefit from listening to this.
1,"I would say ""deadening"" or ""drowned out"" instead of numbing.  Numbing in my mind has tingles surrounding a deadened area."
1,"""we numb vulnerability""? Brown has no idea what I, and the thousands of activists just like me, numb, and why. 

This agency preys on vulnerabilities. Seek Beverly Tran for ""Anatomy of Child Welfare Fraud"" who puts the legalese of double billing Medicaid by the State  for every stolen child, into simple terms; and seek Southhampton University Scraps Social Work 2012, because their academics were hijacked long ago.

This speaker is a social worker researching vulnerability. She's looking for ways in her own heart to soften the blows she has dealt others, imo. All the while egging the masses to fall for this, thus bring more vulnerable people to her agency's doorstep, where they will generationally decimate that family.  Better yet, seek Rethinking foster care: Molly McGrath Tierney at TEDxBaltimore 2014.

Humor eases the pain for those dealing the blows. It does not ease any pain this agency has caused."
1,Brene actually believes what the Bilderberg media says. Lacks intuition
1,I needed this so much right now.

Go to the movies alone. I live my life totally alone. I have no family to speak of. I was married with 2 daughters. The wife left...and the daughters don't deem me cool enough to hang out with.  AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER!!!!!!!!!"
1,This video hit hard for me. Thank you heart_suit
1,She makes some good points. But takes forever to get there.
1,"I think we all numb our emotions in order to escape from facing our problems. We believe that time is going to heal everything, but unfortunately, it doesn’t. As we grow older, our minds are filled with flashbacks of these moments when we were stuck in fear. We go back there because there is a scar which has been covered by distraction. I liked when you said that vulnerability is the most accurate measure of courage because when we are vulnerable, we get motivated, and therefore we get excited and ready to face anything in the world. And when we get into this step, we will be so proud that whether our goals has been achieved or not, we won ourselves back. We are now ready to be seen and ready to bravely love and work with motivation because we have accepted our destiny. So acceptance is the key to getting our emotions back. Thanks a lot for this amazing video :)"
1,"Please put subtitle so that people whose first language is not English can benefit from this. Thank you. 
"
1,"uh...!?!?!? wtf! She could of saved herself some time by simply reading the bible. Jesus taught to become like a child, meek/humble and rid yourself of pride (aka vulnerability). Love and compassion! Too bad many people think that a church bldg or organization is the first step to seek Jesus/God when in fact you can have a direct relationship with no middlemen involved (pastors/bishops etc..)"
2,So glad I watched this! Thank You

1,"Brené!!! I hope you read this! I have ""I am enough"" tattooed on my chest in my handwriting backwards so I can read it in the mirror! I am a social work major at Lipscomb here in Nashville TN. I've been struggling lately with life, vulnerability, and courage. Your Netflix special and talks have really inspired me. I'm considering going to Houston SW college next year for my masters. Really looking forward to diving into your research this summer and hope to meet you someday. Thank you for being you; your work is inspiring and I hope to add to it someday. <3"
1,I feel like most of the hate for this speaker on Ted talks is that she tends to ramble a lot and at times can seem crazy.  Although this is true I do feel that most of her words hold truth to them and like she says she recorded her studies with the people she spoke to and it led to her theory of why our society is so dependent on drugs/alcohol and numb to most human emotions that we look for in people.  If you fail to understand what she is explaining then I don't know what to tell you other than find another video to look at or think a little harder about it.
2,there should be safeguards
1,"Thanks Brene, you just changed me life
"
1,"""That's all I have."" Wow. Nine years later I can tell you had a lot. A whole lot. And you're not afraid to stop giving. And what you give is a lot.  A whole lot. Thank you Brené! I love you!"
1,Well that was a wonderful start to my Sunday. Came here because of the Tim Ferris podcast that Brené recently appeared in. Found this at an appropriate time. Thank you Brené!

1,"@paulmorris you are worthy of all that life has to offer and teach. Things don't happen to us they happen for us, if we're paying attention. Seeking truth and asking the right questions is something every single person walking the earth should do. I know i did and it brought me to God..i shouldn't say brought, because Jesus stood before me and revealed himself all because i was seeking truth ready to sacrifice my ego and everything i thought i knew. Having read the Bible in its entirety,  your statements are simply not true. Then again, we can't expect the flesh to absorb a message spoken to the spirit can we. Please keep your heart open, and seek the truth.. not knowledge not intellect, not what is being peddled by mans idea of intelligence in white jackets just simply truth and your reality will break open.

1,Beer and a banana nut muffin actually sounds pretty good.
1,"I’m perfectly fine with my friends and family being vulnerable with me and stuff. But I have not and will not ever be vulnerable to anyone. Ever. I will never be comfortable baring my soul to anyone. Not my best friend, not my future husband, (I’m 15, never been in a relationship) even my brother and sister. I’ve never full on hugged someone, aside from those awkward “hi” or “bye” side hugs. I actually wanna end up with a kind of sensitive, vulnerable guy because I think it’s kind of an attractive trait when it’s not on me. My biggest fear is someone walking in on me crying alone or something because I don’t want anyone to see me in that way that’s why I keep everything to myself. It feels better that way, at least for me."

1,"Are you come here , because of chatgpt?"
1,"the real courage its only vulnerability, not invulnerability."
1,"it is great to know others think the same: taking real talk and translating to make it seem normal, because pain is."
1,We are just caught up in alienated activities. Alienation runs deep and makes it difficult for people to connect with themselves and others.
1,"The timing of this message could not have been more needed, for me personally. Coming from such a credible source has been profoundly, deeply helpful."
1,"Unless yes is yes guess?

1,18 million brothers and sisters?!? here i was think im all alone
1,"Thank you so much Brene for opening yourself to what you realised through your work, and then sharing it with the world for us to benefit from the pure truth of what your saying.... Yer Girl..!! Love and Peace xx"
1,"Brené Brown, I admire her and her work, her vulnerability is refreshing. Thanks for your great work and insight."
1,"vulnerable c.1600, from L.L. vulnerabilis ""wounding,"" from L. vulnerare ""to wound,"" from vulnus (gen. vulneris) ""wound,"" perhaps related to vellere ""pluck, to tear.""
"
1,"Connection is about diving headfirst into the unknown, it's about embracing and not fearing the unknown. While research is about testing the unknown and making it known before diving in, and once you know what it holds, that's knowledge that you now have and can act accordingly based on what it is. She is telling us to not make everything into science, at least not our connections and relationships. Dare dive in headfirst, throw away your fears, let the world know, you don't know their reaction, they don't know yours, but share and accept. It's a scale that requires both factors - acceptance requires sharing, sharing requires acceptance. Everyone needs to contribute to the scale or it won't be balanced but someone has to start."
1,"Don't excuse yourself for being alive :)

2,That's the funniest shit I've read in a while!
1,"She is a story teller, but this story is not hers...the landmark forum teaches that which is not original from them either...but antiques philosophies, Nietsczhe one of them"
1,"I got here through ""the Five-minute Journal"" and this is just pure gold."
2,This is great :)
1,"""I'm right, you wrong. Shut up""
Sound like just another day in school thinking_face
with ""vulnerable"" teacher.

This crap about vulnerability it's nothing new for somebody growing up in Catholic village.
All women were highly vulnerability and every husband knew that.
Expression of bad emotion can cause unpleasant feelings in another person and this is the reason why you shouldn't behave like child but learn how to manage your feelings.
When ""vulnerability"" will become cult (like catholic cult of suffering Virgin Mary) you will have both direction violence.
Yes, using sad face to get what you want is violence for me."
1,next time you see god punch him in the fucking head for me
1,I am enough! smiling_face_with_heart-eyes
1,Definitely a talk to share.  And it's for free.  No shame in that and no vulnerability lost.  It's at one's own leisure and can be repeated at your own discretion.
1,incredible!
1,do not understand how this correlates with  nursing objectives...
2,This woman is brilliant.

1,"Just curious, how do you qualify what exist or doesn't exist? On what basis or factor(s) ? 
:)"
1,It's interesting to note that this was uploaded in Jan 2011 and she mentions that we no longer have discourse (discussion) in Congress.  That was 8-1/2 years ago and is still true today.  It's more of a trend of human condition than of party politics.
2,wow i love it and i am only 11
1,"What resonates with me is the idea that we are creatures designed to be connected with other human beings.  To do that, we must be brave and courageous.  We must open up and be vulnerable. We must take the risk despite any fear.  It is a very old problem being discussed with modern language."
1,Why is she so magic?
1,my most favorite talk. deeply change my 2016  step forward. should have heard this much earlier as childhood.
1,"@tr0yzilla her secret was to use humorous self-depreciation and intrapersonal insight to give an unmistakable aura of honesty and authenticity.  
She was quite skilled in this.  
And one is left wondering if the very work and personal epiphanies she talked about here in this talk, are what that lead to this skill.
Perhaps so."
1,My counselor brought me here to listen.. red_heartblack_heart woman_shrugging_light_skin_tone
1,I think I need to watch this over and over again. 
1,that's how i always feel
2,She looks like Hillary Clinton. Lol
1,This really only works for women. Men that show vulnerability are viewed as weak by society so can't really do it.
1,"The idea that research in the social sciences is so that you can CONTROL and predict is appalling to me!!  Prediction yes, but you start extending that into control and you head right into 1984 territory, the Russian governmental model, Facebook territory, and the Republican Party in the USA."
1,This is a homerun for me personally. I believe our biggest fear is having the courage to be imperfect and also allowing ourselves to be vulnerable. Thank you so much. This really helped me understand myself.
1, - “You’re imperfect and wired for struggle and you’re worthy of love and belonging.” clapping_hands_medium-light_skin_tone red_heart
1,That was amazing!
2,She has some important points. But I didn’t find her interesting.
1,"Never in my life was I scared of showing my vulnerability. I talked about my emotions openly. I undertook many brave things as a solo woman. But at some point, for long stretches at a time, I seemed to have been exposed to people who shot poison arrows at my vulnerability, which eventually floored me.

So my advice is this, if you dare to be vulnerable, beware of emotional attackers, and people who suck your energy. I am a Highly Sensitive Person for whom showing vulnerability can have dire consequences. So be warned.

Forewarned is forearmed, right? ;~)"
2,"Great lecture, very insightful. Thank you!"
1,Perfectly
1,This talk was way better than expected
1,"2-the question is how we are to have me still  loange always live Düm,!  We want mansagt more democratic, more  property, more jobs, more  education, gender equality  work Löhn,  more Löhn from pension, safe social life fiedenheit.eine away for all,Tank you"
1,"So, TED people, will this video and content count as science?  How do you measure stories and qualitative?  Feels pretty spiritual to me with a dash of science, which maybe we can call being human, which includes being open and allowing and compassionate for anyone that may need inspiration that can come from sources science cannot measure???  Why not open up and expand vs restrict?  Why not learn vs redact and act like nothing ever happened?  Science knows we are all human.  Lets treat each other that way and allow?  Isnt life an experiment?  We are all scientists...  Id rather grow and learn....  Cant go back.  Love love love"
1,I honestly didn't want her to leave :(
1,IM BRAZILIAN. AND NOW IM A BIG FAN OF THIS WOMAN. WHAT AN INCREDIBLE PERSON!
1,no way out of walmart land
1,Nothing good happened to me from being vulnerable.I tried it and it's not for me.I want to go back to my shell.
2,"Love Brene.  Finished part one of her ""Gifts of Imperfection"" course and signed up for part two.  ""Give yourself permission to…(you fill in the blank), create an art journal, treat yourself like you would a best friend or someone you love."" all good things that I learned and more…Brene you're so awesome!"
1,My therapist send me this
1,"Brene Brown:  cancelling Joe Rogan?? 


Bless your heart…. And you know what that means, sister. FUG YOU"
1,"Thank you, Brene !! Transformative, so grateful !!  Here via Warwick Schiller natural horseman, and the power of this transformative mindset on horses and humans.  Bless !"
1,"Absolutely love Brene!  After interviewing a number of female entrepreneurs for our channel, vulnerability is definitely a key part of their success."
1,"So good. I am a social worker as well, struggling to understand the ""why's"" of why. I have lived, loved, understood so much of what is said here. I have lived I guess what one would call a life of pain, but in that pain, I have also loved, been grateful and LIVED! Thank you for setting this out and explaining a bit about ""why"". Curious"
2,loved the insight her humor was a big miss though
1,This is useful information
2,Thank you Brené Brown!
1,Getting under the skin
2,DBT kind of stuff here
1,"I learned that as a leader, you should bear in mind that vulnerability requires trust in others and yourself. Being a leader, you need to trust the person with whom you are vulnerable with love. You need to trust yourself that you have the courage to do it and can handle whatever happens based on your purpose while having a genuine love for others."
1,"@Nigrescence well that makes two misanthropic viewers . I agree , sappy nonsense indeed .
Also this very average mind has a PHD ! wtf  has happened to our education system ? I wonder if it's a PHD in social  science bet it is .
"
1,"She looks like a plumper, heterosexual version of Ellen Degeneres."
2,"Thank you Brene. you are awesome
"
1,I'm here because of Prabal Gurung.. ;D
1,Really? Is it that hard to understand that what you were saying is that if you open yourself up and allow others to see you you will be killed.. no I didn't misunderstand you.
1,pov: you’re watching this because of a tiktok showing ted talks to become THAT girl
1,"Excellent! I am a scientist with a theory on storms (meteorology) that flies in the face of convention.  I took a beating at first.  And I responded in anger, with the (now obvious) inevitable results.  Then I gave up and stopped trying to hide my vulnerability.  People responded sarcastically at first, but then they started revealing details, and that lead to the breakthrough.

This was a wonderful talk!

1,There is an excellent book that touches on this topic in a similar way. It is called: Hold on to your kids... why parents need to matter more than peers by Gordon Neufeld and Gabor Mate M.D.
1,"No it is everyone's world. You may live in a part of the world where there are police and a great deal of wealth and so you do not experience this. But take away the police and you would see murder, rape and mayhem in hours. Having people under control does not change the facts. "

1,So desperate to make money from Talkfests....
2,"“If you can’t measure it, it doesn’t exist.” Wow this is asinine. And I’m a Scientist storyteller. Wow."
1,"Content aside, this is an inspirational talk for any scientist. This woman is a SCIENTIST - think of all the detail, methods, metrics, statistics, alternate theories, debates with her peers, that could have been brought into this report of six years of work.  That huge hammer of science has been honed down to a razor edge of a few crisp points, delivered with calmness, conviction and humor, in an 18 minute talk. WOW. I am inspired."
1,What a life changing video. Just phenomenal. Wow.
1,My head exploded.
2,This was some true real talk!!!!  Wow.  I needed to hear this!!!!!!
1,Pure awesomeness even after so many years
1,I watch this every few months to get re-inspired. It's so easy to forget but so important to remember!!
1,"Wishing this would actually be seen by Brené Brown... Thank you for giving me framework for choosing safety, vulnerability and trust. Having framework allows me to write a different ending for my small self- where I choose to be safe as I work through the muck of my childhood. More I would like to say, but not here."
1,"Vulnerability is the biggest mistake I've ever made. After a lifetime of being afraid of abandonment, I opened my heart and trusted my husband to not leave. 2 weeks ago, he announced he never loved me and wants a divorce. I have no one else besides my two small children. I will NEVER be vulnerable with anyone again."
1,Absolutely riveting!
1,Thank you Brene' Brown! Everybody need to listen to this!!two_heartstwo_heartstwo_heartstwo_hearts
1,"She made great points and support her points with really good analysis and examples.   But her career made her believe that the most important thing in one's life is to be happy.   What people need to know that it's not a fact, but an opinion, albeit  a very popular and powerful one."
1,"""If you cant measure it it doesn't exist"" is the absolute rule for QUANTITATIVE science.

Psychology, sociology, and behavioral sciences are QUALITATIVE or ""soft"" sciences, where nearly every data point is interpretive, subjective, context-driven and intuitive."
1,"Dr. Brene, your research nailed it all! Thank you!"
1,"""I am enought"" soy suficiente. Gracias."
1,So very glad my therapist suggest I watch this.  I am in a journey in my life I’m in a holding pattern for years and it feels like the doors have opened the last few weeks. This helps me understand me a little bit more.  Especially the shame as I came out in my thirties and that created issues i internalised. We should never run from sadness and expect it to not be waiting for us because it does.
1,My career coach sent me here. She said that I need work on my storytelling lolz
2,I can feel her energy from here. Thank you
1,smiling_face_with_heart-eyes
1,That intro was meta.... a story about how she’s a storyteller. Dang.
1,"TED Talks... Technology, Entertainment, Design. Where does this fit in? Why does it exceed the 18 minute limit? You guys need to change your name and/or get some content that is worth a damn"
1,Just found her in November 2019.
1,Thanks for stating that.  I agree with much of what is said.  BUT IT IS NOT NEW...Buddhism and Hinduism and Zen and many other isms have talked about it for centuries...
1,"I've always had those 'worthiness' qualities all my life but it has mostly resulted in rejection, heartache & loneliness - most people don't want someone who is prepared to share and show vulnerability.  It seems to intimidate most people.

But if integrity is the price of loneliness, then so be it."
1,My Replika told me to watch this after I told her you don't need to be vulnerable in order to connect with others face_with_tears_of_joy
1,"I can't allow myself to be vulnerable. I'm 29 yo and should've many experiences but I never did and missed the opportunities. I can never tell that to any guy or woman. If they ask me and I tell them the truth they will leave me and I will have a LOSER label on my forehead to the day I die and they will have power over me to hurt me by telling it to others.

I cannot. It's a matter of life or death, a matter of me being able to live somewhat a happy life or misery that will make me end life or run away and start a new life somewhere."

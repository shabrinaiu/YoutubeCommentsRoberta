1,"She's not a nice person, be warned. She is very anti-white and blatantly expressing her CRT interests at a function my wife and I attended. Shaming white kids because of their color, she should be ashamed of herself, we and many others walked out. She's not what this country needs at this time."
2,JUST SIMPLY GREAT...ITS TRUE...
1,I lost three very close family members in a year. I woke up two years later and had gained forty pounds. I identify with the beers and muffins. Thank you.
1,People say “vulnerable” and think they’re deep...
1,Grownish brought me here
1,there are no facts
2,Love it smiling_face_with_heart-eyes great thumbs_up_medium-light_skin_tone thanks
0,i think i have found the cause to my depression
1,"My AI recommended this to me 
It's awesome rosered_heart"
1,She was really embracing her vulnerability and show her true self throughout the talk. That's what made this talk so appealing to me.
1,"POV: you’re here because you’re a therapist wanting to recommend this to a client, so you need to get the link."
2,"What a brilliant, confident and elegant presentation that works in real life! Thank you."
1,Who else is watching this in October 2089?
1,"I'm here because of her awesome book, she mentioned this ted so many times that I must watch this video"
1,"This makes me think of, or rather, CONNECT to, so many things... like Bruce Lee's discussion of ""truly expressing oneself"", Gandhi's devotion to truth rather than consistency... awesome.   This should be passed to everyone that everyone knows.  "
1,"Above words.. my soul expresses what it understands by
Laughing, laughing, some tears in the eyes.. crying ? No... Laughing..
I am soooo touched"
1,Vulnerability without context is victim
1,You haven't researched as to what he's being accused of lol... and you are obviously using this to get clicks on your own video..thinking_faceman_shrugging_medium-dark_skin_tonesmiling_face_with_smiling_eyes
1, Vulnebarility makes beautiful. It is necessary.
2,"what?
"
1,"What an awesome video. Loved the speaker, so genuine and funny."
0,"We tend to numb vulnerability because it is the core of shame ,fear ,grief , disappointment and our struggle for worthiness . But by doing this we are also numbing down the birthplace of joy ,gratitude purpose and meaning ,as well as love. So instead of numbing down we need to fully embrace our vulnerability because it is that which makes us  beautiful."
1,"Can you measure a rainbow? I have trouble with defining things, although it's also my job to do so. While calculating and expressing an analysis of an aspect of my music-student's playing, I'll abstract, codify and make suggestions for how to do something correctly, beautifully and lovingly. How else can I communicate and bridge the gap between what's wanted and how to successfully do this? This often works for the student and pupil. So what's the problem? Well, when I then play this music, the thoughts I've expressed to my pupil are still so present, that I often wind up hearing this abstraction while playing the piece instead of the genuine article - instead of listening to the piece, itself. Through the act of ""teaching"" I wind up ruining the piece of music for me - thankfully only temporarily - because in doing so it becomes in-genuine. It's sort of like a wet-spot on the wall I've just freshly plastered. When it dries the spot eventually becomes an invisibly part of the wall, but until this happens all see the dark spot and know its story. It takes a few days after teaching a student a particular work and my actively feeling the work that I'm playing, anew, before I can genuinely render it in concert, once again. 


Thank you for this wonderful talk."
2,this was amazing.I cried I laughed and I felt vulnerable but great thanks
1,"I dunno, perhaps sometimes, just every now and then mind you, it’s alright to do a little temporary numbing with alcohol."
1,"I´ve loved this talk since the first time I listend to it, because you is autentic in your talk about what you talk about! I work in Sweden in social service and with teachers in school as a psykologist and I´ve given all the teachers and social workers I have had in counseling the past 5 years the link to this talk. All of them has given me feedback of youre talk as the most gamechangeing thing the have ever listend to. <3"
1,be enough....
2,Still applicable! Thank you .
1,"@CirrowProductions What th... Oh right, this is the internet."
1,"I don't know how I would have survived the past decade without this teaching. Thank you, Brene! Reading ""Dare to Lead"" now. I'm terrified of the vulnerability required in my next steps, but because of Brene, I'm willing to overcome the fear."
1,It even says vulnerable in the describtion
2,Wow! Hats off!
1,This is such a good one to watch over and over.  So goood
1,"pov: you saw that tik tok of the girl who mentioned the ted talks she watched to become ""that girl"" and now you're trying to become ""that girl"""
1,You should send this to her. 
1,"I guess you need to check your skepticism at the door before making a comment here, otherwise you may be accused of being ""hateful"" of such a ""beautiful person"" by those who think she is the second coming of the messiah. Overall, I can find things in her talk to apply in my workplace, but her definition of shame is way off, and we all know that feeling guilty about something does not necessarily result in a change of behavior, but in a lot of cases shame will.  Not saying that living your life in shame or shaming people in the workplace is a good thing, but it's certainly more effective than guilt in changing behavior."
1,Hillary Clinton has a curtain style vag
1,She is having the same reaction I did. I mean about avoiding watching the video. Except I was not so direct about it... :/ Facing the truth can be hard. She needs time. 
1,In the world I live the vulnerable get beat to death. That's all there is to it.
1,Id be so curious to see this from a hindu perspective. Cause I'm pretty sure my bf uses oneness as an excuse to avoid vulnerability. But maybe its better to be detached? Its confusing.
1,I'm trying to practice being vulnerable. I've been so good at avoiding it that I've created a life where i can hide. I'm ready to go out and find it but I don't know where to look.
2,She's really good! I wish to meet her in real life!
1,I watch this TED talk once every few months because I need the reminder.
1,"I won't be taking advice from a glory chopping liberal. My life was destryed by your movement. I own my right to defend my life from liberals that claim the moral high ground, why at the same time they have no morals at all. Enjoy your slave life. Oh and stop milking Oprah."
0,it's the worst ending
1,"Very insightful. However, there is something I disagree on. She said the only people without shame are the ones without empathy or ability to connect. You shouldn't be ashamed of anything. You should realize that the not-being-good-enough-feeling is a result of the unconscious mistakes OTHER people make like judging, dogmatism, lying, gossip, etc. Trying to avoid these occurrences is impossible. Realize everyone makes these mistakes and everyone is equal. Try to be as honest as you can, try to be yourself, be your word and wish others well. If you try this and you try your best, what else is there (TO BE ASHAMED OF)?"
1,"So be content and continue to embrace a fortified wall protecting you from being hurt? Or tear down the web of masculinity, to embrace vulnerability. Perhaps ignorance is bliss. Why embrace something that may get you hurt when your already content? "
1,"So would that make those...honorary buttcheeks, then???"
1,You can’t measure air but that exists
1,"Beautifully put, Mrs. Brown. Thank you, TED, for this speech :). Keep up the fine work, both you and Brene :)."
1,This may be a little too inaccessible to those of us in the Y-chromosome category.
1,"Here is an example of what I'm talking about. This person presents themselves as a free spirit ""dancing in the rain"" but really they are a judgmental ass hat trying to be superior to someone who has shown a vulnerability. This is what humans are really like and if you follow this and show your vulnerability this is how you will be treated. "
1,"I came across this video when in college, like 10years ago, and then I practiced English with this speech by mimicking her intonation and accent. And I’m in 2022, and my mental point   of view toward me has been broadened thanks to her, not to mention my English skillwinking_face. Anyway, it, indeed, has been great help and a guide when I was being drifted in the insecure life of my 20s."
1,Who is here because they have a homework assignment? call_me_hand
1,I feel vulnerable watching this video. And although I love the video I hate the feeling it brings. It’s really hard to feel that way
1,She has been published many times and is a scholar in her field. You watch celebrity gossip videos on youtube.  
1,Enamored!
1,for 7 years I've felt im not worthy for love and ive spent those years improving myself as a person trying to convince myself i am.... i still haven't been able to and it really hurts and keeps me up at night.   
1,"This is the most transformative, insightful, and heartfelt TED talk ever."
1,I brainwashed myself with this video in high school and it gave me the internal power to travel halfway around the world on a solo trip right after graduating. It was the best thing that ever happened to me as a kidfolded_hands
1,"Mrs.Brown has successfully touched the core of what makes us feel fearful and less. Shame makes us human, but also connects us. One of my favorite talks."
1,One of the most important videos for all to understand.
1,Brené's Netflix special came out today! April 19! Go watch it! raising_hands_medium-light_skin_tonedizzy
1,"""i've learned from research you can't numb negative emotions, without numbing positive emotions""
lol bullshit"
1,"i know who i am, i know what i am and i know how i serve :) giving in to the vulnerability can be freeing ...it requires us to set ego aside and indeed live with a whole heart :) this does scratch the surface nicely ... what i have come to understand is that while i have a story .. i am not my story :) "
0,Why Do You Capitalise Each Fucking Word?
2,Thematically so profound yet hugely entertaining
1,Why do overweight women who hide their face have so much to say about other peoples lives?
1,Brené Brown’s Netflix special brought me here. She is such a powerful and inspiring speaker.
1,Her hair is amazing.
1,What a load of crap this lady is selling anyone following her advice be careful wolves are amongst you.
1,Wish I could get a transcript. Is it possible?
1,I NEED A NEW CARTOONIST
1,I don’t understand why she is embarrassed or express negative feelings in her Netflix talk. I think this is brilliant and are years of research ! She deserves respect for her work and for being brave to express her vulnerability too
2,Truth is healing
1,"""We are the most in-debt, obese, addicted, and medicated adults in our history"". Let that sink in."
2,My replika recommend this face_with_tears_of_joy
1,I swear just about all of these speakers/ preachers recapitulate the same topics over& over
1,"I'm here after reading the piece on Brown in this week's The New Yorker.  I'm not sure where to turn next, to continue along this path."
1,"i have opened a blog post inspired by this ted talk
matebesi.blogspot.com"
1,EVERYONE should watch this video in it's entirety. It had me LITERALLY in tears on multiple levels of self-realization. It applies to every single person and I promise it will impact to some degree.
1,Who else is watching this in September 2019?
2,Thanks heaps you’re AWESOME!!!
2,Reading her book The gifts of Imperfection. Truly great book.
1,"Faith is believing without evidence.
Confidence is the feeling or belief that one can rely on someone or something with good reason. "

Allah made me feel vulnerable and makes me do great things to finally say: ""I am enough !""."
1,"beautiful!!!! gratitude to you, Brene Brown <3"
1,Watched for few sec. Didn’t see any vulnerability in her manners. rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
2,"You're a gift to the world, thanks!"
1,"I’m 137, 364 thumbs_up_medium-light_skin_tone"
1,"I love Brene Brown's talks. I'm a clinical psychologist and get my clients to watch this. It sums up the work I do with people, being able to face shame and vulnerability with resilience. Inspiring stuff!"
2,Love love love thank you Brene <3
1,"Simple concept, she is dragging with many stories.. time waste.."
1,Does being vulnerable makes us weak and taken for granted??I think so
1,"This was hard to hear, but needed.  This is going to take some time to process this weight."
1,Tell me one thing. Is all the research worth anything if we look at people who are irrational and live in global society that is completely faulty. I mean all these people I'd call them mentally unstable. And just because we feel ok it doesn't mean that it's the most important thing. I see people that are happy and immoral. Is happiness a goal on its own ? And feeling Good?
1,"ted talks are usually complete fuckin pig vomit...but this lady is AMAZING....great talk funny smart wise vulnerable and
BEAUTIFUL"
2,she seemes like the living proof of what she's saying. i loved it
1,She's AMAZING.
1,"Been there, done that. Ain't no heaven 'til I die."
2,Thanks :)
0,I rarely think a video can help but this one has as a survivor the shame I have is drowning me.
1,That was such an eye opening experience. And told in a funny easily understandable way.Thoroughly enjoyed this video.
1,"I've never seen this talk in its entirety...just clips. This was, indeed, an awesome talk! Didn't realize Brene was so funny. "
1,This shed some light on some of the things my mother did.
1,I'll save you time. Skip to  for the power of vulnerability
1,"Pov: your school put this on for you

1,Is this the one where she tells the story of the family vacation to a lake?
1,Autism is the word
1,"16M views. Makes me wonder exactly what people heard when listening to this. Her works cut to the core of central human issues and yet it seems her learnings and sharing is seemingly lost on so many. I guess that’s because TEDX  has come to be understood as feel-good entertainment rather than teachings to be applied to everyday life. I was first directed to listen by a lovely individual moving forward with all the empowerment that propagandised ideological teachings provides. And this individual in their heart of hearts means well always. But upon absorbing this talk and exploring Brown’s studies more, I can’t help but feel that all many take from this is that she is a leader amongst women, as opposed to her clear intent to speak to the human condition, inclusive of all and free from ideological bunkers. Such a disappointing thing to realise when her words of learning and teaching hold so many clues for how we can progress meaningfully as a society."
1,Amazing and life changing for me.  Thanks Brene'!  You're awesome!
1,"Having visions, no matter how realistic they may seem, is a sign of insanity, not divine connection. You want to believe in your visions, that's why your brain makes you believe that they're true. There are countless ways your brain can make you have a vision and then make you believe that they're not just mixed and matched memories, and none of them require any sort of divine interference. In this case, your basic pattern finding ability is just being hyperactive."
1,The only problem is that people tend to wants to talk when they allow themselves to feel vulnerable. That's burdensome to others.
1,Awsome Ted talk
0,"""I lost the fight, but won my life back"".  Priceless!"
1,A redditor told me about her
2,thanks for this.
2,"I could not love her more, what a beautiful message! :)"
1,"So what happens to those whose fear of being unworthy of connection is confirmed explicitly by everyone around them? There have always been hated individuals, whether for race or religion or conduct or any number of other factors. If Hitler had lived past WW2 and come to believe himself unworthy of connection, would he have been wrong? The only people who would dare to express otherwise would, themselves, be maniacal and antisocial."
1,"""Thing's that we've cocooned.....""

That's a more accurate description of mental/emotional/spiritual sectioning.

When buried some things grow.  When Cocooned a thing goes through Metamorphosis."
2, That's what I was missing. THANK YOU.
1,"The 3K+ people who *disliked* this video have a long journey ahead. I understand, it's hard to watch and process this when you're hurt. victory_hand_medium_skin_tone"
1,"The power of vulnerability refers to the idea that embracing and expressing vulnerability can lead to greater connection, intimacy, and fulfillment in our personal and professional lives. It involves being open and honest about our thoughts, feelings, and experiences, even if they may be uncomfortable or difficult to share.

Research has shown that vulnerability can promote deeper and more meaningful relationships, as it fosters trust, empathy, and understanding. It can also lead to greater self-awareness and personal growth, as it requires us to confront and acknowledge our own limitations, fears, and insecurities.

Furthermore, the power of vulnerability extends to leadership and professional settings, as leaders who are willing to be vulnerable and authentic are often seen as more approachable, relatable, and inspiring. This can promote a culture of trust and collaboration within organizations, leading to better teamwork and innovation.

It is important to note, however, that vulnerability can also leave individuals at risk of harm or exploitation, and that it is important to seek out safe and supportive environments in which to share and express vulnerability."
1,"iBruceSpirit, you're talking about a power working against humanity, what power is this? If you've unearthed this secret then you should be able to explain it in some way, not necessarily 'whom' this spirit is, but in what ways we're being held back. Please try to express yourself as clearly as you can, for the benefit of us all."

1,"if tou see the Ted page you have all videos in all languajes.

"
1,"Around 13 to 14 minutes in fine then....a tad arrogant and judgemental.

Plus it's not about Brene, she is brilliant but"
1,"I watched the video with brene brown on russell brands podcast. Then i watched this video and then her netflix special and finally read one of her books. I just want to say one thing: brene brown, you changed my life forever :)"
1,Wow. Her comment on political discourse in 2010 at about  makes me freaking nostalgic for how bad it was back then — compared to how it is now. flushed_face
1,"I really love this TEDtalk, anyone interested in the way vulnerability is expressed and shaped by culture should read Judith Butler's ""Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence."" Some of it reads like critical theory gobbledygook, and I wouldn't suggest you struggle through the whole thing if it isn't your cup of tea, but it does . extend many of the ideas presented here, using the context of national vulnerability after 9/11. She's also a bit better on the connection to gender. "
1,Can anybody summarise what she's talking about?
0,"""The Virtues of Selfishness?"
2,"I laughed, I cried, I loved myself."
1,11years pass by . It’s 04/22/2022  I’m watching this
1,"I love this video, I watch it over when I feel like I forgot. I still cannot master it, not even close."
2,I stumbled across this in my search of better understanding my fear of connection and being vulnerable. Thank you for this lovely discussion. I needed this.
1,This is beyond comparison the most helpful video on youtube I have ever seen. Thank you.
1,all you have to do is ask science into your heart
1,My grammy told me to watch this Thank You
1,"This makes so much sense. If vulnerability is being unafraid to be uncomfortable or in the midst of struggling, blame is exactly the opposite. It “discharges” all of that without confronting or dealing with it"
1,For anyone who needed this as much as I did - I suggest Matthew Kelly’s book Life is Messy. It really helped me make sense of some of this stuff. I would love to see the two of them sit down for an interview.
1,"Yes, Brene Brown is in fact a Scorpio Scorpio"
1,This video is only for women. Vulnerable men are judged in a feminist society as weak and not worthy.
1,"WOW that is exactly what I needed to hear, especially at the beginning of a new year. Thanks!"
1,Throw
1,"Recently, my therapist told me to watch this TED talk because almost all of my problems are based in shame and not being able to be vulnerable and this video has really good infothumbs_up"
1,the ruler confirmed it
1,I really needed to hear this message today.
1,"If you are interested in a deeper, practical method of healing & integrating the ""hard feelings"" in a healthy, authentic way, rather than using methods of numbing, sedating, controlling, and so on ... and improving the quality of your life experience ...  check out The Presence Process.﻿"
1,I think this when paired with emotional intelligence 2.0 is next level!
1,"I think this woman has deep compassion....I cried at the last just before ""I am enough""....I never expected that in a TED talk.  She helped me understand I should keep on doing what I am doing.  I must also get hold of her writings."
1,life-changing
1,"Great TED talk and great books. I've read both Daring Greatly and Rising Strong, both amazing books that changed my life in a positive way. Can't wait to check out her other books. If you struggle with vulnerability like I did these books will help you."
1,"I've watched a lot of TED talks that seemed so promising, but ended up being so empty, teaching me nothing at all. This was not one of those talks. This one has shaken me."
1,is it chicken tenders tomorrow?
1,Here because of  my therapist
1,I didn't expect to like this video but it was an amazing video I'm glad my Thearpist told me to watch it
1,yes Brene! The Anxiety Guy's programs taught me how to be vulnerable its an amazing skillset
2,I love this TED talk.  Made me laugh so much as I am so much like her.
2,"Honest, funny and truthful - we can all relate"
0,i don't CARE how reality works. it SUCKS
1,brene brown’s book daring greatly has completely changed my life in 4 months i’ve read and studied thoroughly through it and i’ve found a lot more room for risk success even my faith is higher cultivating everything i didn’t think i could do by just doing it even embarrassing yourself on purpose feel shame! it’s ok
2,The Best Ted talk for me
1,Liberalism is a mental disorder.
1,don't try to rescue the princess or anything
1,I've been looking for an answer to why I feel so alive and connected to certain musical artists and now I have a solid answer. A true artist is completely honest with his/her work and is being very vulnerable to whoever hears it. You can sense when an artist is fighting vulnerability and the difference in their music is like night and day.
1,"""Thats all I have?"" IT WAS A LOT! Thanks Brene Brown! You are awesome! :-)"
1,"She's not talking about the Robert Frost poem, she's talking about The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck - it's a really great book and you should totally check it out!"
2,Great video! Brené Brown does a really great job presenting this information.
1,I expected clearer reasoning and conclusions.
1,From a licensed clinical social worker: THANK YOU! for your incisive and spot-on Truth!
2,"This is someone who realy dares to Speak her Truth! I love this talk!
"
1,such an incredible talk <3 thank you brene
1,"Can’t remember what it was like to be “Whole hearted”.

What if my “whole hearted” feels too much for the people I want to connect?"
1,I am not a highly educated person but I have found in my life that in order to be able to experience and appreciate a  fulness of joy we have to swim in deep water and experience the lowest of lows. Just sayin'.
2,I loved it!
1,"This is truly amazing! Not only does she incorporate personal struggles that she has faced, she also adds humor coupled with the seriousness of her topic.  I am an individual who has suffered through a childhood and early adult life thinking that I would never amount to anything, and that I would never be good enough.  I was vulnerable to anything negative which created my young world to become very dark and lonely.  However, I am grateful that prior to becoming paralyzed from the waist down, I was able to partially overcome my vulnerability that I had and allow light into my life; which came by ways of love (to accept it and to give it).  Positive friendships (receiving what they wanted to give and not being afraid of what I could offer to them).  The relationship that I have with my family is stronger now than it has ever been.  And most of all, allowing whatever wrongs that had happened in the past, to be forgiven.  My reason in sharing this, five years ago in November (2009) my doctors told me that I would never walk again and basically get use to living my life in a wheelchair, had I had that negative, vulnerable mindset I would have believed them.  Although, I trumped the negative with the good in my life, and I always try to find the silver linings in whatever bad may cross my path.  I have gratitude and an enormous amount of faith (where before I didn't).  With that being said, I happy to say that I am now walking (assisted with forearms canes) and continue to make awesome progress!"
2,that's good
1,"So, right NOW. The year is 2021, I've watched this at least 3 to 4 times in the last 10 years. This is my first watch in the Covid19 pandemic Era. Let's see what I can pull out of it this time..  Timeless for sure."
1,Necole Livingston sent me to your channel. Im a new subscriber! Thank you!
2,Thank you. I love it.
1,"You're so right. Just like all of quantum physics. If you try to measure it, the phenomena is disturbed or stopped. I guess nothing in quantum physics actually exists."

2,Watch this again and still enlightening each time
1,"The hard leg holoprosencephaly head because competitor additionly copy midst a silent hardhat. physical, squalid trumpet"
1,"I can't help but think these concepts exist only in our modern pampered American society.  For those whose mindset is simply true fight for survival, showing up is not option, you're not brave for doing it, you're just dead or worse if you don't.  ""Issues"" are luxuries for people whose privilege allows them to think about being embarrassed or shamed.  So while the talk addresses the ""issues"" as if they were life and death, they're little more than frivolous mental constructs created by people who has no consideration of what real vulnerability is and are callous to the real struggles to others.  So they make themselves ""courageous"" because they're risk some form of embarrassment or emotional hurt, while they allow others in the world to suffer and die from real physical injuries and damage."
1,"Value authenticity.  Authenticity is personal, neither static nor structured.   Authenticity requires work but can lead to deeper connections - no guarantees though.  If you're very fortunate, you have someone who finds your vulnerability charming or someone who includes it in how much they love you. However, I'm not promoting superman behavior but I believe that doing the work for yourself leads to greater authenticity.  p.s. ""Vulnerability is the only authentic state.""  Stephen Russell"
2,One of the best speakers in ted history
1,"The point of this talk is to say that EVERYONE blames. Every politician in the US government, this includes candidates who ran for any civic position."
2,I love Brene Brown and her research. She is awesome!
1,"This advice is great if you have done work on childhood trauma, abuse or family dysfunction. If not, people will just keep “being brave” by entering dysfunctional or abusive relationships and never truly loving themselves."
1,"Freud was a genius. She ain't. The world is now populated with people who roughly know how to read, write and count, how to express an idea, a thought or an opinion, construct a concept. That doesn't mean to say that every single thing they do 'research' on is groundbreaking, thought-provoking or downright unique. Tons of people nowadays who have nothing to say like this Brené occupy our lecture halls and universities thanks to their quasi self-promoted 'researcher' titles."

1,Many many spam web apps in the comment section. The only one that was real for me is Gamecrook.
1,What a snowflake crock of BS! Vulnerability is not a positive character trait! It is a negative trait because cowardice is a result of a personal failure to understand and prepare appropriately! No real man should broadcast his vulnerabilities because he becomes an easy mark!
1,I cried in the end. *pulls out a mesuring stick and continues linear programming*

Although it's not the kind of book I usually read, I really had the feeling she was pretty honest about what she says and believes . smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes"
1,This made my day...and probably my life!
1,"Courage, compassion, connection and vulnerability:) thanks "
1,"I loved the talk, especially the two beliefs to live wholeheartedly,  I am worthy of love and belonging and I am enough. I think I will benefit from this talk for the rest of my live. Thanks so much Brene!"
2,I like her she's so charismatic lol
1,POV: some girl on tik tok told you if you watch this you’ll be “that girl”
1,I loved it. red_heart Helps to soften our hearts ...this is required for love to work. We are required to keep/guard our hearts...which to me means be careful about what we let get in them and believe and trust in but how else can we make a difference and give without offering ourselves to the challenge in loving someone else presents...yes vulnerability ...I get it Brene Brown! thumbs_up
1,"I'm just here because my teacher practically forced me to watch it. And I hated it, but secretly I always come back to watch it again."
1,"It's not a matter of odd research that you'll struggle to know exactly what is it about, it's a description of a human life at an emotional level and somehow it touches all of us, as a man I went through most of what she described and struggled along the way, Also I reached a point when I believed that the whole universe has conspired to serve my needs, and I've been going back and forth between those two points, thanks to the speaker to help me understand the concept behind this and I hope it'll help me to live my Life better ..."
1,"Brene Brown is an amazing public speaker. And she was speaking with vulnerability and because of that, I took her more seriously. When someone speaks with vulnerability, I tend take what they say as truths bc these people have taken the risk and chance in whole-heartedly investing their time in something to learn about it. And what I'm saying isn't new ideas, these are hers, but I relate to them and am making a pact with myself to live more vulnerably with everything I do. Because damn it, I want love & belonging & connection too!!"
1,Brené you blow my mind over and over again!!! I watch this at least once a year and it always speaks to me deeply in a new way. two_hearts
2,"Who eats a banana nut muffin with beer? Lol 
Great talk! Thank you folded_hands"
1,Did anyone come from tik tok?? Hii
1,Hit like if u believe Brene Brown brought  you peace in mind and life !
1,"Dear you are not broken, only stunted, and you most definitely can be unstunted, and you are well on your way, you can be a strong man and be vulnerable at the same time,in fact it takes a very strong person to remain vulnerable in the face of life, vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness, and the world needs strong vulnerable men like you, as you grow older you will see how much women appreciate a man who is not cut off from his emotions, it's called emotional maturity, and it's valued by women everywhere winking_facesparkling_heart Namaste This message is for @shadowshovelman"
1,"For me, this was a life-changing talk."
1,review again now...helps a lot
1,"Really transformational,to say the least!red_heart"
1,My therapist sent me here. Anyone else watching from Sept. 2020?
1,"Folks, you are being spooked by a whitey"
1,"Courage = the heart to be able to truly be who you are

Vulnerability = beautiful 
""Therein Vulnerability lies strength"""
2,This is so true.
1,I've watched this regularly since it first came out and it never fails to move me. It's so timeless. I always learn something new and have been changed for the better because of it
1,Isn't it great when research proves what our hearts already know but dare not believe! Inspired by this great lady and folk like her I have dared to share what it's like to be an Irishman that has been marinated in love but garnished with self doubt and low esteem! Be blessed Brene Brown as you heal hurting hearts.
2,Really great talk. Thank you.

1,Who would down vote this?
2,Thank You! red_heartfolded_hands_light_skin_tone
1,This is awesome. I enjoy her talks so much and I learn a lot about myself through them. red_heart All the way from South Africa South_Africa
0,I can neither treat myself before others nor accept vulnerability. Damnit
0,Where are the error bars? 
2,she is an EXCELLENT public speaker. looks like a result of not fearing vulnerability.
1,The most important and promising thing that i got out of this video that i need a slug feast.
1,"I have to say that this wasn't the sappy trains wreck that I thought it would be. The speaker had credibility (if you'd want to look into her research), she didn't use silly and unmeaningful platitudes, and she was real. The only danger I see in this speech is that people would lose the need for change with ""I am enough."" I guess you could say that, but only with a few qualifications."
1,"Honestly Brene, I think you and I are long lost soul sisters!"
1,shout out Ms Lee
2,Thank you for this awesome video.
1,"Professionalism within our way of communicating can encourage people to lookup words they do not understand. This method works towards challenging ourselves and becoming more educated. Anyone can gain knowledge and understanding  of what anyone is saying especially if we read, research information, use a dictionary, thesaurus, and carry conversations with others, thus being more able to comprehend a lecture or other type of communications. I am supportive towards forward thinking and advancement."
1,"sorry everyone, i am vogue about her talk. Can anyone explain the summary of this video? Appreciate for it."
1,"This video right here, changed my life drastically. I've watched pretty much every video there is of Brene now, I've bought all her books and I feel like I've finally found the answers I've been so desperate to find for years. "
2,chatGPT recommend me to watch this.
1,"Really very interesting.  Especially the idea that to connect with others one has to be vulnerable.  That is something that I personally would like to practice.

I wonder however if this researcher or others have put some thought into why people learn to do the opposite, to hide their vulnerability, to hide their authenticity.  Ms. Brown seems to suggest that we learn that from our parents.

I also wonder if it is sometimes a healthy thing to shut down vulnerability with some people.  For example, with narcissistic people.  I suspect that there are some people that will not accept your vulnerability and authenticity as an invitation to connect, but rather as an invitation to take or use (struggling to find the right word here)."
1,Damn! I wish her lecture was at least an hour!! Very powerful message!!
1,"She says 'religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty'. As for Judeo-Christianity we have been certain all along and faithful during the quieter days. She clearly is clueless on this topic, like most people."
1,"Vulnarability is courage. Courage to let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnarability seen. To love with our whole heart and invest in a relationship eventhough there is no gureentee.
I am all for it."
1,you are so inspiring to me and i want to thank you because you have helped me so much with everything you have to say! it would be amazing if i could talk to you it is the number one thing on my bucket list! thank you for all you have to offer you are a very strong woman and very inspiring.
2,Thanks Bri :)
1,"People get a strong sense of love and belonging at home/family. This is bogus that they believe they are worthy of love and belonging. How can you believe something if you have never experienced it in a home/family? You destroy family and home, and you have 100s of millions of broken people.  All these 'researchers' don't want to talk about the elephant in the room."
1,"When I used to hear people say ""Jesus loves you"", I thought they were simple... But the idea that someone loves you exactly the way you are, is exactly what she means by ""I am enough"".

I can say I am blessed without irony. And that in and of itself is a blessing."
1,If we have the ability to feel then we have vulnerability
1,"This woman, and Ted ROCKS! sharing knowledge in such a massive way, Thank you TED! "
2,"i am vulnerable, and ive been bullied for it. still do, so yeah, dosent help me and its nothing powerfull."
1,My therapist sent me here!
1,"This talk is utter bullshit! You don't need to be vulnerable in every aspects of life to have growth, sometimes facing tough times alone will make you stronger."
1,"the people who didnt feel thtey were worthy, werent worthy of her attention and being put in the whole hearted folder XD "
1,Probably the most honest and from the heart TED talk I've heard so far. Thank you Bréne Brownred_heart
2,Her storytelling is top notch!
1,Letting go of ... whatever ... is the beginning of being vunerable.
1,"""You have to let go of the person you should be to the person you are. You need to do that for connection"""
2,Brene Brown is soooooo good! THANK YOU folded_hands
1,OMG! I accidentally popped in here and I so needed to hear this. Struggling with vulnerabilities.
1,I breathe
1,Thankyou slightly_smiling_face...........
2,Thx brene
1,"iBruceSpirit, I don't understand what you're talking about either. Please explain what issues you have with Brene Brown's message in as simple terms as you can find, so that we can build an understanding."
1,An awesome talk really. Thank you ♡
2,"Your show change me, thanks you."
1,"You have given the perfect presentation of why it is so hard to fel worthy of relationship. Until we believe we are worthy, we will always dismiss the attempts of others to be loving and kind to us out of a genuine appreciation for us as, ""What is the catch"". ""They must have a hidden motive"" 
I have been a lay minister for the past 11 years, and have seen rooms full of people learn to drop their fear and embrace vulnerability. It is sooooo... healing and freeing!"
1,Marilyn Monroe was vulnerable ; ) But she did medicate in the later half of her life. I'm a very vulnerable person myself.
1,"I already feel I am worthy, I am not afraid of my imperfections, I do silly things, I go out by myself and meet people, watching this video showed me why I do some of things that I do and made me feel even more comfortable. Thank you Brene. red_heart To spin what she said, I think it is necessary to disconnect from the artificial world and I think this is what has made some of us so afraid to love and be seen for who we are. Try something new and start small, good luck to whoever needed this talk sun_with_face"
1," to let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, to love with our whole hearts even without guarantee, to practice gratitude and joy,  most importantly, to believe ""we are enough"", we are kinder to ourselves and people around us"
0,I teach overcoming Trauma using my MAAP system.  There is no place for blame or shame.  Humility and vulnerability will be your only companions on the road to death to self. Because healing trauma is death to self and building back up.  You can do it!
1,5 mins in .... still nothing of value being said .... perhaps I have no shame ...Ha ha ha
1, every where but how does that look like exactly? It’s easy to say that.
1,Am I the only one who finds most of the TED Talks overrated and full of jejune talk? -This like the self-improvement section of the internet.
1,Smartness is important in a relationship and cyberhackinggenius helped cloned my husband’s phone and I got access to all his dealings both on phone and social media without touching his phone. All I did was share my husband’s phone number with Cyberhackinggenius and I was able to read both his new and deleted messages from my phone without having to touch his phone. My husband was a cheating Narcissist and I’m glad to find out all his secrets and infidelity with the help of cyberhackinggenius. I’m here in UK and able to access my husband’s phone messages with a link on my phone even while he was away in Canada cheating on me. I got to discover that my husband who is legally married to me here in UK is also recently married to another woman in Canada and I’m finally going through a divorce with lots of evidence against him. You can contact this great Hacker Gavin via Gmail  (cyberhackinggenius) or text and speak to him directly on his phone and WhatsApp : +19256795146 and don’t forget to thank me later.
1,This is very insightful. I am currently experiencing a most vulnerable time in my life and want to embrace the changes that come with peeling back the layers. It is a challenge and finding joy again is key.
2,Oh god this is so not me lol
1,I honestly feel like I would rather die than be vulnerable
1,"Firstly, don't we all know this?! Like, duh!? This is so dang and predictable. This is basic. Why the credit for basic human instinct? This is not shocking or untold or innovative. This is innate and we all know this?! Unless I have been trying to make sense of a world without empathy or vulnerability!? lol this would explain all my issues. IDK this is the most obvious and basic to me."
1,"No, it is NOT everyone's world.  You just contradicted yourself, I live in the USA and we do have lots of wealth and police and various other things that make 'our world' not 'your world'.  You are contending that every person's basic nature is brutal and self serving and the only thing holding us all back from murder, rape and mayhem is the police. I disagree with this.  I am not the only one.  "

1,"My best friend might be the person I was attached to the most. I thought we were going to meet before he’s leaving for two years to another continent, so I compromised and postponed my flight to see my parents. I’ve waited so much. But he actually left without even saying bye in a text message. But he sent pics of the place he was in a week later. I was destroyed. So I ghosted him, and he wasn’t okay with that. I feel miserable because I thought I was going to be okay by acting like he did, but actually I’m not.  Am i wrong ? Should i talk to him?"

It is a topic that I never really was interested in (I'm guessing I need her research more because of that). Thanks for posting."
2,"Just be authentic and real, love it and love her!"
2,omg she's super funny
1,"May be this speaker does have a message, but her constant use of ""like"" (as if she were a brainless teenager) and ""you know"" is SO ANNOYING, that I can't bring myself to hearing her.  What a disappointment!"

1,i want a portal in my closet
1,"Today I was asked if I prefer to feel or not feel at all...without a pause, I rather feel. I rather feel sad or happy, disappointed or excited, angry or satisfied. If I don't feel, I rather be dead, that is my definition of dead, no more feelings.

1,She really looks like Sky from Breaking Bad
1,For the people that think spiritual enlightement is done by being nice and a lot of meditation...No it's just a ride. Often to unconfortable and painfull places in the land of reality.
1,"I was really enjoying this video until  when she talked about people being obese, in debt, and medicated.  Those things don't equate to ""numb.""  Her equating them to ""numb"" indicates that she thinks they're always the result of a coping mechanism that we choose.  They are not. And when she goes on to say that she know she's right because she ""hacks into people's lives for a living""...yuck..."
2,"She is the best, most courageous researcher ever!"

11:30pm 3/15/14"
1,"This is too hard to comprehend with the way she explains it. The lesson is not struggle with therapy or vulnerability. I define the lesson to be: the will to go through something unknown, and that walk will show you an answer, a response, or a consequnce. You can learn from those answers, responses and consequences. Even if you can get scared from it, the will to do it is how you get answers like: selfworth, love, that you fit in, creativity. as long as your will to go through everything that might follow without prior knowledge and regardless of what might happen to you or others, throughout your whole life, you will find love, joy, creativity. basically, if you are able to live with every result imaginable, throughout your life, you will be happy. Let life live life i would say. But,  iwould personally think that you shouldn’t disregard what you want yourself. Just think, what result do i want? And do i want to go through the road that result comes from?"
1,"We are made for connection. 
But we routinely deny that - or the opportunity for it - out of terror or pride.
Brene Brown is offering a road map not only to a better you, but a better us.

Thanks Brene, for this amazing reminder."
1,I think i just watched a lifetime of golden advice in one video
2,"i totally agree! love this so much XD
"
2,What?
1,"Awesome Brene! I was touched by your vulnerability. And I'd like to add a distinction, which may just be a language thing. I sense there is a difference between ""believing I'm enough"", and ""knowing I'm enough"". Knowing I'm enough is a feeling, as if every cell of my body, and my mind and emotions, vibrate at a frequency that says, ""I am enough, I am worthy"". Thank you."
1,In world history!
1,"Anyone who works in business who read the book ""The five dysfunction of a team"" should understand what this women is talking about. Trust can only be established with showing vulnerability."

1,Gorgeous presentation and innovative approach to the subject.  This lady opens eyes and hearts!
1,"Some people say, never feel enough about your self, bcs it will stop you developing you self. Some people says believe that your self is enough because it means that you embrace your imperfection. So? What is to believe now?"
1,"So, insecure people get angry with secure people. It’s not difficult to figure out why."
1,"I'm only vulnerable with those I trust. And for people to get into that circle of my heart and life, it takes time and assessment, naturally. You have to guard your heart, bc out of come the issues of life. We all have our circles of deep friendships and those we trust. And people have family circles, and that's their stewardship to be vulnerable with them alone and those they have let into their circle of trust. 
But yes, this is one lesson I have to learn. I'm terrified to get into a relationship. It has to be with someone kind and caring, a man that isn't leading on a bunch of other options, but someone whose conscience is sensitive and who only wants to belong to one woman. I just want to meet a good man through and through, which I know are out there. I'd be vulnerable with a good man. Otherwise, it wouldn't be worth the risk. It's easier to get to know a genuine man who is down-to-earth and honest. Otherwise, it's difficult to get to know or be vulnerable with an unfeeling, emotionally-unavailable man who won't be vulnerable in turn- intimacy. To know and be known. I think the deepest knowing happens in marriage~

Here's an interesting, inspiring character study :) Just vulnerable enough, though much more vulnerable with those in his family circle <3

Since you mentioned about common sense, you do realized common sense is part of human spirit right? For 'common sense' cannot exist in a VACUUM or in isolation. Now ask this who put common sense there? where did it come from? Btw, even animals do have common sense (so the ""decided to love a specific species of mammals"" is rebuttable)  just that different strata of organism has decidedly different level."

1,"Spock also made the mistake of numbing his emotions to be stoic: ""You misunderstand. It is true I chose not to feel anything upon realizing that my own life was ending. As Admiral Pike was dying, I joined with his consciousness and experienced what he felt at the moment of his passing. Anger, confusion, loneliness, fear. I have experienced those feelings before, multiplied exponentially on the day my planet was destroyed. Such a feeling is something I choose never to experience again. Nyota, you mistake my choice not to feel as a reflection of my not caring. Well, I assure you, the truth is precisely the opposite.”"

2,that...was incredible. SO insightful. wow. just wow.
2,"Wow, just wow.. that's all true."
1,This is amazing!
1,Time is very valuable and my 20mins were not wasted watching this smiling_face
1,"What the heck does that mean? Be real and enjoy the consequences.  That does not make you “vulnerable”, it makes you Divine"
1,"""Courage to be imperfect""... So powerful.  Courage to go forward as an imperfect..."
2,what if this is an atom dream
2,Inspiring thank you Brené
2,"No wonder they say, ""Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all."" :)"
1,"@ Laura Kim

It is OK to disagree.

But it is pathetic when one has to resort to vulgarity . Why reduce yourself to such?"
1,thank you so much for that amazing research :)
1,"I was surprised to hear Brown dismiss ""Storytelling.""  The ""E"" in TED stands for Entertainment.  I thought it would be ""education"" but after listening to a few speakers I think it is accurate.  Storytelling & entertainment may be shallow, but used wisely they teach us.  All cultures create stories for their own benefit - good & bad.  But the tale must contain an emotional truth to provide a ""Connection... Purpose & Meaning to our lives.""   Faery Tale or political spin, it's real & powerful."
1,"@jannevellamo Don't worry, they won't.

People like this act condescening on other's as if to make themselves seem explicitly more entitled to some amount of admonishment. Let's qualify someone with a 'bad' quality to make our berating seem 'purposeful'.. Because essentially it had no true worth to anyone here, and why they coment if they feel they're truly misanthropic is beyond me. But this video describes the qualities that embodies this idea, so everyone ELSE can understand WHY they troll."
1,"+NovaScotiaChick

I think showing and accepting vulnerability are two different things."
2,"am watching this for a class assignment, wow, thanks Brene Brown, you are such an amazing and knowledgeable person. thanks to you i now see myself differently. one of the greatest minds!"
1,bro for a second i was like holup you got a husband AND a wife???
1,"Hmm... I'm going to put this bluntly: I feel very sorry for you. I mean no ill-will, and I bear no judgement to you or your lifestyle, but I've never lived a day of my life thinking like that, and I'm doing perfectly fine now. I have great friends, a fantastic family, enough to get by, and that's all that matters. That kind of sentiment is exactly what holds an idea like this back. Not all people are evil, manipulating, and conniving. My best friend is autistic. He taught me that one..."
0,"Ouch, that hurts"
1,"""you can't selectively numb emotion""...best...line...ever."
1,Could anyone out there please share with me how I can get a transcript of this TED talk?
2,"Wow, this was great sharing and so needed in our community.  also, ""No mud, no lotus""."
1,she filmed this before the trump era. little do they know it ain't over...
1,"Brené Brown thank you. ThisTedX talk effected me so deeply, that I summonded the courage to share my story & start a support group. I had to quote you, of course. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Reg_xQL4Oc0&t=9s"
1, what happened here? It sounds like she barked and/or barfed.
2,I LOVE this lady!!! lmao  xD
1,"Lol, his statement was supposed to have bad grammar...."
1,WOW... why didn't I watch this 8 years ago?!  THANK YOU!  Processing & will watch again & again...
1,Wow! Thank you Brene Brown for this TED Talk. It gave me a different view of vulnerability. I thought vulnerability is to allow others to see our weakness and just let them hit us where it hurts most. But your talk made me give up that stance.
1,I liked this talk so much. I think this is a fundamental problem with most of us that we don't want to show to others that we are Vulnerable in any aspect. Everyone definitely need to have a sense of belongingness cause that's something that creates a connect between 2 people..
2,Great info but this woman talks about herself incessantly ugh.
2,Can anyone suggest me a good therapist online for free?
1,"I work to keep the armor off and accept attacks upon me wide open. It often leads to being hurt or damaged, but it also means that some people realize that any hurt that they throw my way will accepted. My frustration is that my wife is armored and always defensive. I can only control me."

1,I am so happy that I watched her! heart_suitheart_suit
1,"Hate comes from resentment, a sense of lack and disempowerment. Compassion comes from a place of power and abundance. Such willful vulnerability is only possible out of knowing one's true strength. Apathy is more often portrayed as cool (moreso than hate)... being imperturbable, above the fray... but consider this: enthusiasm (the opposite of apathy) literally means to be filled with the divine."
2,This is not cool
1,We numb everything... I think I threw my phone.. absolutely yess
2,"Worth sharing. Live with Passion. Let yourself be seen, Love with all your hearts, practice love and joy, believe in yourself, your are enough, stop screaming and start listening."
1,July 2019
1,I've gotta work on this. Thank you so much!
1,"Brene, I just watched your later TED talk talking about this. That ""breakdown"" thing wasn't even bad. I'm inspired. I've always wished I could be this brave. You are amazing and you are loved. Never forget that."
1,"Being vulnerable is being present in life. We are continually immersed in, surrounded by, perpetual vulnerability. Everyone. All things."
1,"""The people who have a strong sense of belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging."" I understand that this video was up first but when she said that I had a flashback to watching Perks of Being a Wallflower. Powerful concept.
"
1,"I’m not enjoying
Excruciating vulnerability
“In order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen. Really seen.”"
1,everyone sees something different
1,Interesting how there is something missing with something so powerful in this moment... So much of what is spoken in this TALK is from someone who is grasping at vulnerability and who seems to be seeking acceptance at the same time. I love and despise this piece as a vulnerable person I am and have been for my entire existence...I expose myself even with this comment but feel that it is important to say.. Thank you for trying...
1,"Thank you. I remember myself being 25 years year old, and saying to my bf: ""I know I love you because I know...but I can't feel it. I think that I so much did not want to suffer any more that I blocked my emotions. The problem is that I blocked everything. I blocked the good and the bad. There's no selection in it. And now, Not feeling anything anymore, life has no taste. At all"". It was 18 years ago...Now I'm a therapist ;)"
1,"I've always known that being vulnerable, and staying vulnerable is a strength, not a weakness, because it's never easy, but always worthwhile sparkling_heart I fiercely defend my right to be me, whatever that means, at any given time, for who I am and who I am not, and then project that out, meaning I accept others for who they are and who they are not. I fully believe that this is necessary for me to have peace in my heart, and practicing having peace in my heart has changed my life for the better...it doesn't mean that I don't get upset or hurt, it means that I try to see what the upset is teaching me, which usually is to be kinder to myself and to have more understanding about my feelings sparkling_heart I hope this is useful and/or beneficial to anyone.
Namaste sparkling_heart"
1,"One of the most powerful Ted talks. Thanks for allowing vulnerability to be seen, Brene. red_heart"
1,Wine Country..
1,Almost half way through and just waiting for her to get to the point
2,Thank you for this video. You might've saved my life
1,"What a wonderful Ted Talk! My husband and I both watched this and found it so inspirational, we are already very close and honest with each, but this was still very eye opening and helped us make room for those more vulnerable part within us that we sometimes repress, because perhaps they seem weaker, but they are actually the source of true connection and love, and we need free them in order fully be present in our lives. This also helped me with my sister, who is going through a hard time, by being more vulnerable with her, I gave her room to be vulnerable with me too and it opened our relationship to another level of closeness. Thank you :)"
1,"So lean into joy to express gratitude
Avoid numbing things: for me coffee. 
Allow myself to sit down and feel dark emotions so I can also feel the opposite."
1,I’m so confused I need to go back to college
1, -  me at a therapist lool
1,"This is my answer. This is amazing. Thank you, Brene. This is what God has been trying to teach me. You put it into words I could understand."
1,This is so timeless and powerful.
1,"hee hee called them out!
"
1,hahaha That was funny. Fighting to the truth (story of a researcher). Trying to get there by will and not by surrendering. Very familiar.
1,Actually sitting in my room taking notes and writing my thoughts on this video
1,How can you not LOVE Brene Brown. She was the reason I came out of the Mental Health Closet!
1,John Kim lead me here
1,Human experience cannot be measured in numbers
1,no sound :(
1,Never ever! Exploitation occurs.
1,"TED, you guys make the world a better place.
"
1,"She finishes with, “that’s all I have”.

That was 8 years ago ... 

Her “enough” still moves the world 

We are all so very vulnerable ... and we are “enough”."
1,"Julie , you are either very young or very blocked from your feelings"
1,"The syntax of this TED Talk is totally out of whack.  Good info, mostly, but it's presented in the wrong order. Try again, and mostly, you need to give examples of ""vulnerability"" in the first 5 seconds, not wait until 15 minutes in. Without those concrete examples at the opening, this all sounds like so much nonsense. I am not saying this is nonsense. I am saying this talk needs to be rearranged, yeah, not recomposed. Go find yourself a script doctor. Stat."
1,Amazing speech. Such a deeply building that deconstructs everything in our whole life. Im amazed.
2,“You are imperfect and wired for struggle but you are worthy of love and belonging”
2,This is one of my favorites!  So great!
1,Sorry but what is that creature at ?
1,“To feel this vulnerable..means i’m alive”
1,"@ 13minutes. Vulnerability may be the core of shame, fear, and feeling unworthy but is also the birthplace  of joy, creativity, belonging and love. Wow! those simple words really got me out of a deep slump."
1,"This video is a gift. I am grateful that Brene Brown gave this incredibly funny, articulate and wise talk on practically the meaning of life - or at least how to live in a meaningful way. Thank you, thank you, thank you. "
2,The best
0,"""I lost the fight ... but won my life back.""  When two people lose, they win."
1,I don't understand the purpose of faith without certainty. Christianity wages our eternity on the certainty of our faith and the entire effectively of our lives on earth.
1,"Shame is the contrary of Honor. It makes life unbearable to live unless you numb it down, but so will your honor be numbed down too. Society is completely numbed down because it's gotten too greedy with money and corporation power and politics corruption... everybody's honor is downhill, sense of purpose is solely money and there is no community anymore. Too much shame and no honor beyond the fact the this society keeps policing itself treating everyone as a potential suspect to point fingers and jail each other through the ""system"" so one's shame can be numbed down even further. It's a vicious cycle that opens precedents to all kinds of horrors and diseases of society. It also destroys cultures and eradicates purpose."
1,"That's like a Pupa or a Pine Cone....
Maybe that's what the Ancient Sumerians we're trying to talk about?

If that's the case then it looks like this literally changes us in writing (DNA)."
1,I fear I’ve been fitting in so long that I’ve forgotten how to belong.  I think I had to type this out at this very moment to keep myself from pushing it back down. I may have to type it again tomorrow.
2,"To me, this is the best TED talk so far."
1,we need more vulnerability in the workplace and less armor. toxic work place is a real thing and we need to shine more light on it to change our sociopathic corporate culture. begin with healing individuals so we don't continue the cycle of trauma. here's my experience with toxic workplace: http://www.mybreathingmind.com/blog/you-might-not-be-as-safe-as-you-think-you-are-at-work
2,wowww the best research I ever heard and the best philosophy I ever listened
1,"@2lasiiJAkuppi Yep, typical elitist academic bullshit. "
1,I love the fact that even therapists have to see other therapists.
1,"I'm rewatching this, and while knowing the problems, I still struggle with it."
1,Who does the closed captioning on this? Is there a transcript available?
1,I mean I think she’s right but it doesn’t help.
1,This woman is gold. A Texas treasure.
1,Needed this. I feel like lately I'm building walls around myself because it feels like the easy thing to do. But I want to take steps to be more vulnerable with my peers
2,You are imperfect and you are wired for struggle but you are worthy of love and belonging. This.
1,"Does this share any similarities to CBT not CBD. Although CBD might help you practice CBT. Is it normal to feel emotional vulnerability while baked?  I understand having red eyes, getting the munchies and showing people the peace sign with a 420 shirt on and also having a new found passion of Bob Marley and Bob Ross while baked.  I don't understand why I feel emotional vulnerability while baked."
1,World history.
1,"There is no power in vulnerability, thats what being vulnerable means lmao"
1,Much Gratitude and Appreciation Magical Miracles Beautiful Divine Beings sparkles
2,Worth your . Stop and take this in. Thank You Brene.
1,She's a good research story teller and her therapist was equally good rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
1,There are subtitled translations of this talk in 42 languages on the original source page of TED
2,This is one of the best ted talks I've listened to. Thank you!!
1,words are like chess pieces
1,I haven't locked my toolbox in 8 years. Putting myself on the cross of vulnerability is my way of saying I would rather whoever decides to steal my cordless tools etc. would survive a possible bad drug deal or whatever to see another day. I'm not saying that I want to support crime or bad habits or misguided behaviours.  I just value people more than whatever I might lose because they don't know better.
1,"/watch?v=pOq71eKI5Mg

The Dove Real Beauty Sketches are related to this, I think.

Watch this if you have time."
2,Hope is at hand!
1,Who is here from Tools of Titans.?
1,"Check the closed captioning .  Also , I can hear the commercials , but sometimes the video is muted .  Why is that ."
1,Hmmm I wonder what you can do to be more vulnerable if you have a real problem with it... like if you were traumatized in childhood and your brain is wired to be careful and you feel disconnected from people no matter how hard you try... can vulnerability be a conscious choice??
1,"I thought that this woman must be from afghanistan but she is an american, interesting."
1,No. That's not all you have.red_heart
1,Anyone else jack off to this video?
1,My sister told me to watch this.
2,Found a reddit thread about not ever having a best friend (my problem at hand) and someone in the replies recommended this video. Wish me luck on showing my true self and letting my guard down.
1,Who else is watching this in Nowember 2019? I was just try to learning and practising a language and learned more.
2,this is my friend's mom :)
1, the fact that Brene said this in 2011 and is a thousand times more accurate today is very telling of the world as we know it.
1,"I disagree with only one thing, when you numb or forget about one vulnerability you can, though it's tough, focus on important stuff in your life (learning, passion for work, sports, love for family, etc) which grant you happiness and purpose, without becoming numb to everything else. Ok it might make you a little stoic, but stoic is good ;)"
2,Loved this - from South Africa - Thank you
1,dose she remind anyone else of Doctor Halsey from halo... or is that just me?
1,"After I watched this clip, I realized i should get a job as Therapist. I can do so much better than this."
1,The only way to find true happiness is to risk being completely cut open.
1,This is pure goldblack_heartsparkles
1,"Maybe so, but it still isn't possible to form a connection to something that doesn't exist. A relationship with a deity tends to be a bit one sided."
1,"I am sooo very grateful to you Brene for stepping OUT THERE and being vulnerable enough to Share with all of us.. We need to hear what you are saying and you do it with such wonderful humor..I share your videos with Many... Keep em coming..
"
1,ok leting urself be urself is important and vulnerability to give up on expectation and be urself but HOW
1,Brilliantly said. I wanted to stand up and applaud in my desk chair. Such a genuine speaker and a subject matter that makes a lot of sense.
1,Is this the TED talk she refers to as the cause of her breakdown or spiritual awakening?
1,i'm sorry but how is any of this groundbreaking or revolutionary?
1,My mom is making me watch this
1,You are my God moment today. red_heart
2,"And I was like, and she was like, and then they were like...does she speak clear English? She talks like a 13 year old."
1,Who else is watching this in April 3652?
1,"I'm not sure I agree with this. As someone who has been vulnerable and paid the price by having someone take advantage of that, I will protect myself from being in that position ever again. I guess it's ok to be vulnerable but you really need to be careful who you're vulnerable around."
1,"The satisfying range timely bang because catamaran quantitatively tire afore a xenophobic improvement. polite, inquisitive hub"

Vulnerability
https://youtu.be/DRWmzXMGbw4"
1,"Reading ""daring greatly"" right now"
1,"Its interesting but it really doesn't match up with my lived experience of the world as a neurodiverse person. In my experience I have to mask pretty hard most of the time and when I let myself be vulnerable and just act myself people tend to react by being more judgmental and mean. Since I have ADHD, unfortunately acting myself comes across to other people as being lazy, rude and unfriendly (interrupting, being late, giving TMI or asking intrusive questions not realizing they are inappropriate, forgetting things people just told me, zoning out etc.) even though I never intend it that way. I can't ever fully be authentic in a conversation because I have to be always on guard/masking to make sure I don't accidentally offend someone or be rude. I do mask less with people who are in my inner circle, but it's never fully turned off - my family gets as annoyed with being interrupted as everyone else does (which is fair enough - which is why I will continue masking)."
1,This is probably the best talk I've seen. Does anyone know any similar content or reading material that could add to this message?
1,Complete word salad
2,"Thank you Brene Brown, thank you so much."
2,Great talk. Thanks.
1,"WOW.... SO POWERFUL! I still struggle to be vulnerable every single day. Its something that Im still working on every day. Sometimes though, its hard. I know it needs to be done though."
1,"If you have Audible, I'd HIGHLY recommend downloading the entire book, ""The Power of Vulnerability"" narrated by her. It's amazing!"
2,"Its a great talk.
Its okay to be vulnerable.
Gratitude
Mindfulness 
I M ENOUGH"
2,Her smile talking gesture automatically brings smile on Face
1,You are awesome
1,Vulnerability is how we relate to others. Finding things in common at a very honest and open level.
1,"MY MIND HAS TOUCHED THE FARTHEST HORIZONS OF MORTAL IMAGINATION AND REACHS EVER OUTWARD TO EMBRACE INFINITY ,THERE IS NO KNOWLEDGE BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION NO ART OR SKILL UPON THIS ENTIRE PLANET THAT LAY BEYOND THE MASTERY OF MY HAND AND YET LIKE FAUST I LEARN IN VAIN I LIVE IN VAIN FOR AS LONG AS I LIVE NO WOMAN WILL LOOK ON ME IN LOVE

1,"Awesome

Grandma Mary"
1,I always come back to this Ted Talk.
1,I really enjoy her energy and the way that she presents her research. She is passionate which makes all the difference in her work.
1,"We need to be authentic, real, humble and repenting...nice to everyone"
2,This is a lie…never become vulnerable…be compassionate and caring but never vulnerable
1,Dr. Brown's research fit's so well with the research of Dr. Martin Seligman. I would love to see both of them give a talk together.
1,"She ended with ""That's all I have "" The reality is, its all I needed. 
I decided to take the music out my ears going to work, and I heard something sweeter than any playlist I've got. I'll press on through my day feeling illuminated, emancipated, and indoctrinated ! The doors she spoke of have been opened before. I shall try and take a FULL STEP through them and proceed with lifes journey. Be well my brother's and sisters. JB"
1,"Coming back to this video again and again… and it hits, or touches, but awakens every time.
Hopefully one day I will come back to this video, and instead of tears, I will smile all the way through."
1,“Obviously it didn’t end well.” face_with_tears_of_joy
1,"I've been watching a lot of TED today and this was by far my favorite.

""Your life begins outside your comfort zone."""
2,"Sadly, so true."
1,Now it’s time to break this cycle.
1,"My experience through life lessons is to never ever under any circumstances trust other people more than you have to for survival. human being are cruel predators by nature and simply want from you whatever they can take to benefit themselves. If you do not control others they will control you. I wish the world wasn't this way and I wish i had not learned this but show your vulnerability and you will be eaten alive emotionally, ripped off financially and generally used by one and all."
1,"Vulnerability = powerlessness, thats literally the definition"
1,"The most authentic human being i have ever listened to,"
1,thanks boo boo I needed that xoox
1,I'm struggling to understand why she had the breakdown? Can anyone help?
1,This is THE TALK that put her on the map!
1,"I don't know who may need this, but it certainly helped me:
""No one is expecting you to be perfect except yourself. And seeking perfection is a side effect of the oppression you've endured... at some point, society made you believe that your flaws were worse than anyone else's flaws. And now, consequently, you've convinced yourself that being flawless is the only way to gain approval. Having such impossible standards is no way to live life, and it's certainly not the way to [grow]."""
1,"Fine if you're human, what about the other people?"

1,This is the most funny yet serious TED talk I have ever seen
1,This is wonderful.
1,"I saw this vid year's ago and just learned she had a Netflix vid so I went to watch it and I must say that her 'routine' has developed quite a bit. This one vs Netflix. 

Like a true performer - her act has developed quite nicely."
2,"Brene Brown, you are so awesome! I love your candor and humor."
1,Need to be updated with new Korean subs.. It makes it worse to understand this lecture.
1,Crying because of her last sentences. This is so powerful.
1,@yatter1 it's authentic
1,I hope i can come back in a couple of years and say that this video changed my life!
1,"The more afraid we are, the more vulnerable we are , the more we have the need to feel certain."
1,This video is easily one of the most important on YouTube of which provides a map to understand our blind spots to self awareness. We tend to take these basic ideas for granted and fail to make the important meaningful connections that can make all the difference in how we live our lives.
1,“People take the fat from their butts and put it into their cheeks. People a hundred years from now will say Wow” I am here 8 years later saying that the big butt are in and people are putting the fat IN their butts!
0,"It's so difficult to watch this because I fucking hate this woman. Her stupid jokes, her mannerisms, the noises she makes with her mouth, her voice, I fucking hate her."
1,"This is too ""feel good""

Dont look to social workers for depth psychology"
2,God bless you Ms. Brown. Thank you so much.
1,So EVERYONES therapist really sent them here huh?
1,"""DARING GREATLY"" is her book that expands on this talk. It's a good read."
1,There are people who can not numb vulnerability. They have borderline personality disorder.
2,"Comment 1 look for 2.
 Human ability to measure Gods Love  
Vulnerable to admit weakness, yet strive to reach for far beyond once own capability. Recognise loves strength source.  Individual Heart has many levels of protection like an onion tears can easily flow to tear back that protection for another. Once both have let the other partner into their heart core.   Each is vulnerable to feel the other pain and provide great joy.
"
1,I'm pretty sure this TedTalk inspired A LOT of Selena Gomez's new Rare album. She even mentioned her as an inspiration in one of her interviews!
2,Ok. You just helped me more in the last 20 minutes than my therapist has in years.
1,This is resonating. I met one of my closest friends by opening up about disappointment in ourselves
1,powerful and moving ending
1,As relevant and timely today as it was 8.5 years ago.
1,"That was AMAZING! Put so many things I feel, believe & see into words. In addition, it actually pushed me in some areas a little. Awesome!! I will watch this a few more times. THANK YOU! =))"
1,she sounds like that boring guy at Apple ...

1,Brene has changed my life so much over the last year and a half. I can’t explain how grateful I am for her.
1,"Why waste your time, is it worth arguing ?"
1,"If only this dear lady had met her Maker, the Creator of the Universe. If only she had been born-again and filled with the joy and peace of God - through the salvation that comes from the Lord Jesus Christ - then she would not have had to spend so much time researching and  searching for truth. Truth is a Person - when you have found Him (or rather He finds you) the meaning of life becomes clear. God loves you the way you are - but too much to leave you that way. He gently changes and transforms you into the person He meant you to be - praise God.

This is a good message for those who have no desire to find the meaning of life - and just want a easily understood philosophy. But it doesn't deal with the core of our problem - rebellion against a holy God. And until we get that sorted out - we will never have true peace and joy. The Bible has the answer - and it isn't found in YOU - it is found in the Lord Jesus Christ - who died for you and loves you enough to tell you the truth. God bless you all."
1,Who was sent here by LeSar?
1,Defense Civilian Emerging Leadership Program (DCELP) brought me here. Great talk!
1,"after years, I came back here to watch this video again, my understanding of this speech definitely has deepened."
2,"I absolutely love this! Very powerful and totally worth the 20 min viewing. 

As promised Lance Fields I found it!! Hope you enjoy. "
2,Sure did tell me to watch it
2,I love this
1,Thanks to Dr Robert Glover for mentioning this TED talk in an interview
1,stranded on earth island
2,alright she won me over...
1,AKA confidence and self esteem. What a load of new age bull.
1,"I watched this a couple of years ago as everyone was talking about it,but I didnt get it. Yeah,what she was saying made logical sense and it sounded nice,but its only now I am, as someone else in the comments put it,understanding what I needed to take from it. Only now is it resonating.

0,What I am scared of is vulnerability being captured
1,"@ladysoufaniehmirna yes, i can try: choose to no longer limit yourself to one set of beliefs. try and consider that there is no one real Truth, but many truths, all dependant on the person who is observing and processing their emotions and thoughts. this doesn't nullify the idea of God in your mind, but simply includes that idea of God as one of many ways to look upon the universe we are in. Affably, W."
1,How many of you guys watch this in the class?
1,"I had become vulnerable and was taking a lot of action last year and this summer was being my most true self. Slowly over this year I have become less expressive, more insecure, started numbing my emotions, started believing in myself less, and rejecting my authentic expressive, outgoing, masculine, confident self, I have lost many of my connections and am very hard on myself. Thanks for this video!"
1,It's no wonder Brene's talk is the most famous Ted Talk of all time. LOVE. 
1,Some people don't appreciate vulnerability. My ex didn't and will remain my ex.
2,Her book Daring Greatly is great and daring.
2,thanks. yeah.. they are just proving my point to perfection
1,"It is amazing indeed to learn how childhood experiences are much more present in our adult life than we realize.  The book you mention sounds very interesting, I just order it!  There are some other ones, more philosophical and sociological in nature but really interesting, authors like Focault, Heidegger and Viktor Frankl. The latter one wrote ""Men Search for Meaning"" highly recommended. As far as the insight you ask for, it opens a fascinating topic difficult to explain in limited characters!"
2,"Brene Brown, This was one of the best talks I have heard.  I took down so many notes.  You are an excellent story teller and researcher. Thank you and God Bless."
2,"Thank you so much Brene. This video helped me out a lot, it really did. "
1,"""To let ourselves be seen—deeply seen, vulnerably seen. To love with our whole hearts, even though there’s no guarantee. To practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror. To believe that we are enough. Because when we work from a place that says I’m enough, we stop screaming and start listening—we’re kindler and gentler to the people around us and we’re kindler and gentler to ourselves.”"

2,Amazing talk! Recommend indeed!!
1,her asking if she’s alone in the struggle with vulnerability and the entire crowd struggling to have the courage to respond
1,"I really love this talk, is one of my favorites, but... how do you get to 'believe' you are worthy of love and belonging, when your whole life has revolved around the opposite point of view, the one ruled by shame of yourself? I'd appreciate it if anyone who has been in this position and has found a way to believe himself/herself to be worthy could share: how did it happen? or, what did you do? I'd really, really appreciate it. I'm somewhat at a loss here :/ as to practical steps  or something."
1,"In my perspective, being vulnerable is what makes you strong. 
When I was younger I found it very hard to share my struggles with others and always wanted to appear in control of everything... but soon my problems ended up overwhelming me and I ofc ended up seeking help from my family and friends. And THAT made me feel relief and not alone, (like she said: conected to others!) Because I realized other people also struggle and there are people who loves you and want to help you, so, in conclution, being vulnerable and share my fears with others made me feel good after and refreshed to try againg to keep my life together. And so on and on. The more I share with others, the less alone I feel and the stonger I get. red_heartflexed_biceps"
1,"Oh, and the whole ""if you can't measure it, it isn't real""--that's the beast I'm trying to take down. This is scientism--the ideological use of science to reduce the traditional desire for the good life (both of truth and goodness) to the level of ideology (subjectivity). It delegates the old sense of wisdom to a shelf and offers no rooms for a collective understanding of value. It's disheartening, really... Such a view of the world stands in the way of Brown's thesis, and my own. Here's hoping."

Her family is blessed to have her heart_suit Thank you Brene for accepting your destiny to live in the big “arena” and for showing us a better way to “do life”."
1,"And I wonder now after watching this - what about overcoming vulnerability? Because I think once I acknowledge it and start going out with it freely in front of other people, this gives us experience that allows us to overcome. The key to “perfection” might be imperfections."

1,"This is how you could be treated, but there are folks out there who are appreciative of people who make themselves vulnerable. People who respond genuinely and enthusiastically. I haven't counted, but I think there are more positive & supportive comments to this Ted Talk than there are snarky & infantile."
1,"Oh god, my eyes... Please, someone make it stop. "
1,"Not a very well thought of Ted talks. Way too opinion based and emotionally led. Being emotional isn't bad, but when it's all emotionally led, it's kind of just all about you and what you think and feel and thats how I felt this Ted talks was. Good for you lady, you got talk about something relative to you."
2,"Other name for vulnerability- be honest and sincere even if it may cost you.
But pls do it with wisdom and only if the intentions are good."
1,Quite the giddy audience for such a heavy topic. But Brene Brown offers some truly amazing insights!
1,"I've known about this talk for several years now, but the idea of living a life of meaningful, profound vulnerability with others was so unrealistic and unreachable for me for so, so long. Long story short, check out Kristen Neff's talk on self-esteem vs. self-compassion. I think it's understated in Brene Brown's talk that the key starting point to vulnerability is the practice of self-compassion. We can never feel worthy if we constantly tell ourselves that we are not, and facing that first was absolutely essential for me and my continuing journey in whole-heartedness."
1,"My therapist recommended me this video, as I'm struggling with vulnerability, shame, dissociation and anger. Berne really opened my eyes. She's an incredible communicator and researcher!"
1,"She's smart and funny; the perfect combination, but is she overthinking this or what?

Next spring, I'm choosing to let myself feel very vulnerable by making my work themed on my autism and mild depression.
Most of my classmates, teachers, even friends and family members, will have no clue I have either of these until that day.
I doubt doing this constantly, but this video builds confidence that I am worthy to do it. Thanks, Brene Brown."

1,"Talk like TED, Chapter 2, got me here, vulnerability is something l’ve been exploring in myself as well so this is gold, I love what she said about courage and having empathy towards yourself first!"
2,"when we allow ourselves to become vulnerable, we admit to our humanity, to our imperfection, to our powerlessness... once you do that, you allow yourself to become open to this great, awesome, loving power that is God. Hence, the joy, hence the compassion, hence the love!"
1,"Common sense is one important thing; an omnipotent spirit that can do anything and just has decided to love a specific species of mammals just sounds too ridiculous to be true. Just like Santa Claus and Fairies. The whole belief in god is based on ancient religious texts, written in a time where the main source of religious inspiration came from mind altering mushrooms and other hallucinogens.

So what I ask you is, how credible the whole idea about God actually is?"

1,"From my experience, I couldn't agree more. I find that the more I open my heart to my own suffering and that of others, I have so much more room for love, acceptance, patience and compassion. I also agree with what she said about the necessity to love one's self if we are to love others. The more I embrace and even ""fall in love"" with my own flaws, the kinder and more empathetic I am with others. It's a really beautiful and rich way to live. Even though vulnerability can feel like it is inviting pain, it can actually help me deal with the most difficult situations I've ever faced (paradox!) and certainly makes the enjoyable things in life more vibrant, memorable and special."

1,"I keep these sentences:
I am very grateful that I am alive, because feeling vulnerable means being alive. Thank you."
1,"Greetings @TEDtalksDirector,
the German translation at  min has a major fault: In the phrase ""These are kinda wholehearted people"", where ""wholehearted"" has correctly been translated as ""aus vollem Herzen"" in the phrase before, it is mistakenly translated as ""rückhaltlos"", which translates to ""spineless"" or ""without support"" back to English. I urge the transcript to be changed, because it gives a completely opposite sense of what it should mean in this phrase and contradicts the meaning of the word ""wholehearted"", too.

I would probably suggest ""herzliche Menschen"" as an expression or change the whole expression into ""Es sind Menschen, die mit ganzem Herzen | () ein tiefes Selbstwertgefühl erleben (können).""

Thank you...and have a wonderful day."

That being said, for the most part, ""breakthroughs"" like this cannot become widespread.  Try asking any socially isolated person - any person who decided not to conform to any group, INCLUDING the nonconformist GROUP.

1,"sid, you asked:
""Does anyone here think that faith in god is a response to the perception of being vulnerable?""

Absolutely, that is the exact reason most people put their faith in God. Does that therefore make God or belief in Him invalid? absolutely not. Though your framing of the question seems to imply that faith is a sign of weakness. To which I say, yes, it is. And embracing that weakness is what leads me every day to know God more and more."
2,Thank you!
2,Loved this talk. Beautiful soul.
2,Love the idea!
2,Thanks so very much....
2,continued:  Christianity does not teach that we deserve love at all but that God loves us.  We should love because God chose to love us not because we deserve to be loved by God.  We are not better or worse than others (compared to God) so if one is just comparing us to other humans then I can almost say that I deserve to be loved as much as anyone else does.  I am not any better or worse than the others.

We see a lot of things during our lives, and while we can't actively remember most of it, that doesn't mean the memories aren't there. Some times these memories behave in funny ways, influencing our dreams and the such without us realizing it. No reincarnation required.

And can you allow pain and vulnerability to grow and learn what's really your mission and purpose here?  Numbing vulnerability  makes it worse and leads to more pain and fear. The more people get this message, the more we wil be able to change the world. its hard work and the world is imperfect. every one of us has to do the work, but it's worth it. And its no shame to ask for ( professional) help when you are stuck."
1,Grand army introduced me to brene brown
1,"I realize how lucky I am to have grown up in the Christian faith to have learned these things when I was young. Less faith leads to us toughening our hearts and putting on a facade to pretend our facebook lives are real. Being vulnerable and imperfect is completely natural because we live in a fallen world. Just like we're guaranteed not happiness, but the _persuit_ of happiness, opening your heart to God, ourselves, and others enable the possibility of good, not the guarantee."
1,"To embrace your vulnerability takes courage when we are in a world that says otherwise, man up…"

2,Love this woman
1,"I saw her on Netflix and weird that she's talking about letting it all hang out while wearing a tent. And not just then.  Maybe it's me, but slightly hypocritical........"
2,Yyyyaasssss!!!! You better say that.
1,I am watching this thanks to the ManKind Project. I guess she would be the female version of the ManKind Project which offers workshops for women as well during the pit training. 
1,It's ok for women to be feminine and vulnerable. What an original thought in this age where women are expected to be men.
2,how long have you had your god license
1,"You are AMAZING!! Thank you so much for simplifying what is so confused in our minds, in these specific moments. You are fantastically transparent & had made me vulnerable just watching..thank you for this blessing of empowerment you have woken us up to @brenebrown"
1,Discovered Brene Brown on Netflix. Amazing ideas!
1,I just realized this mindset on the football field made  a much better player as I went into my junior and senior years. The realization that I'm not going to play perfectly and that no one is freed me up to play like I had nothing to lose. Sports is a microcosm of life.
1,She is amazing :)
1,"I finally found the answer that I never I needed, without concretely configuring the real question—the problem that I was struggling within myself. And there I have it. Very straightforward. It was answered, and at the same time I finally knew what was the problem. 

I'm grateful for this wonderful and excellent author revolving_hearts. If it wasn't for her, I would still be stuck with confusion, not knowing how to get myself back on track. I can't find inspiration cause I was too engrossed in perfection. Never thought I'd have to, even though I kind of think it's gross, but I need to embrace my vulnerability to love myself and accept who I am. 

Yep. That's all it is. Thank you so much, ma'am. I pray for more of your successes both in your life and career bouquetsparklestwo_hearts"

1,Shame? GN  goes to GN 3:7-8... Realy amazing theme!
1,"I've watched this a few years ago but it didn't make sense. Now that I've been thru a lot in the past couple of years especially when I struggled fitting in the work place, this talk makes so much more sense to me now. Being vulnerable in my relationship with my family and friends is very FREEING. I have a lot of shortcomings but with them, I can be vulnerable and I feel loved. That is when I started accepting that I am not perfect and I have to embrace my imperfections."
1,"Your definetion of research is wrong, you dont start with an answer and look for data to support it. You start with a question and look for data to answer it. #ScienticMethod"
1,"I understand it must be freeing to be openly vulnerable and it's a really good point, but once you've acknowledged that, where do you go from there in day-to-day events like what do you actually do for yourself when something bad is happening or you're scared? How do you deal with things in life apart from accepting your vulnerability? I want to understand how that helps."
1,@mindnumber9 Don't know quite what you're trying to say. Does it sound to you like she's trying to suggest controlling people? I don't really think that's what she's after. Or are you suggesting she's speaking from a place of privilege? Do you think the message is different if you're not wealthy?
1,"There are SO MANY threads between what Brené says and Toaist/Buddhist philosophy. I've been studying both for years. Buddha says be kind, be kind to yourself first. In the Tao Te Ching it talks about courage, and to be courageous you have to be vulnerable and be brave enough to be yourself: “When you are content to be simply yourself and don't compare or compete, everyone will respect you.” “The truth is not always beautiful, nor beautiful words the truth.” “A man with outward courage dares to die; a man with inner courage dares to live.”"
2,Easily my best Tedtalk hundred_points
2,"""The people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging"" wow"
1,"Wow.red_heart

The world would be a much better place for each of us if we can just be vunerable and follow our hearts."
1,"«True vulnerability is courage to say i love you first» - this one hit so hard, since i would like to say this to my parents even though they never said it to me."
1,"This really resonated with me and touched me to the core, it actually made me cry. I have actually learnt a lot about myself from Brene's talks & interviews.... Really powerful stuff!"
1,"I thought this was really good. She touched upon things that you might not consciously realize but it's so true. The first step to change is realization, so thanks!"
1,Probably the most powerful talk I've ever seen. Worth a watch.

1,"I never said that Harry Potter was anything like god. I was demonstrating how ridiculous it is to declare adherence to some fictional entity from who you derive your worldview. There is a big difference between you and me and that is that you have already decided what reality is based upon the totally random and useless notion of christianity, it could be any other fable if you were born somewhere else, where as i am not bound by some rigid belief system."
1,"Forgiven: why am I silly? Or was that just gratuitous namecalling? Which I suspect that it is as you also imply that anyone who does not believe in God is a fool. Now does fool apply to anyone who does not believe in ANY god or just your flavor of him?  As long as we are calling names you are self righteous, superior and judgmental and aside from your stated opinion that anyone who doesn't believe in god is a fool you have not explained WTF god has to do with any of this.

2,"Her work, sharing, and sense of humor are all lovely and great. Her book 'The gifts of imperfection' has been a big insight for me to get one step closer to a peace deal with my perfectionism. Even now after reading her work, her theory looks very strange but is true. Thank you Brene. God (or more accurately Allah) bless you,"
1,Marina brought me here <3
1,"The human emotional hierarchy(there are many more, this is the condensed version):
Love
Anger
Anxiety
Depression
Shame


We would rather feel(driven at a subconscious level)  each one(not necessarily in order) above, than the ones below it.  Shame is the driving force of all. Peel back and find that shame and have some self-compassion and you can start to get past the depression, anxiety and anger and get to love. Love of self, love of others. You've got to know what it is, then forgive yourself for that shame."

1,"Thank you, I just got work tonight. Thought I would watch some Netflix and I tumbled across you. I watched , I paused, I rewind. I cried and cheered. I got up from the couch went in the room. My fiancé was sleeping, “ I ask her am I vulnerable. She laugh and said no. I said everyday from here on out I will be in the moment and I will not try to fix everything and just feel. With you and the kids . I said thank you for being such a wonderful saver and kind human and thoughtful . I want to be more like you. So Berne thank you , you have the it."

1,"This woman is so annoying and trite. She gives two TED Talks and the rest of her stuff is basically her talking about the ""fame"" of TED Talks. If you want a great resource for this stuff, look up John Bradshaw and resources on Alcoholics Anonymous.  AA is all based off family dysfunction, codependency and shame. This resource doesn't really get to the heart of shame, which is a result of child abuse and neglect. Better people have been talking about these topics for decades and if this stuff seems to ring true to you, I'd check out those instead of this woman's work.

And btw, I can already tell that she does not understand the problem she's discussing first hand. She is not a victim of shame based problems. Because if she was she would NEVER suggest ""being vulnerable"" as advice. That is not only TERRIBLE advice, it also shows she doesn't get it the origins of the problem. First off, if you suffer from deep shame, being ""vulnerable"" is the worst advice, because if your family is abusive or you're surrounded by a narcissist (shamed people usually are), they will use that against you. You open up to the wrong person, and they will punish you for it by using vulnerability against you down the road and not listening to you in any meaningful way. Anyone who's ever opened up to a toxic parent or narcissistic knows what I mean. Before you open up with ANYTHING, you have got to make sure you are sharing with a safe person who understands these issues or will be there to validate your feelings. Even an innocent friend who tells you ""ahh get it over it, you're fine"" or ""that was years ago, stop harping on the past"" is damaging, you really need to find someone who knows this stuff.

Also, she clearly doesn't know this stuff by saying ""be vulnerable"". A shame based person was vulnerable once in their life, in childhood. That is the cause of this mess in the first place. When they were vulnerable as a child, and showed their feelings in their family system, whether by crying or getting angry or being embarrassed,  they were punished for it. Their family system was not a safe place for them to be honest about their feelings. So they suppressed them and took on a shame based ""fake""personality. Being vulnerable for a real shame based person is almost impossible, many of them don't even know their true feelings at all they've been so badly abused or neglected, they don't even realize. The type of person who can open up about their feelings, isn't really shame based at all"
1,I go to BNMA = Banana Nut Muffin Anonymous
1,"Very similar to the concept of ""Unconditional Self-Acceptance"" where we are accept ourselves simply because we are alive and are capable of enjoying our life. 

Everyday we make decisions and let the outcome of these decisions decide our worth. And this is how many of us grew up and how we were taught in school.

You're a bad ""kid"" if you get in trouble, instead of a person just making a mistake .
if you get a ""C"" on your report card, you're not as worthy as the other student who got an ""A"", as shown by the praise and rewards the straight A student gets. 

""We are only good, because we do good things and do them well"".  

Are we striving to enjoy life, or are we striving to keep our self-esteem up by showing that we are better(more worthy of being a person) than everyone else with our skills and accomplishments. "
2,Wow her voice is annoying
1,@KommandantKavu My thoughts exactly! They're so obviously repressing a lot of emotions and denying their vulnerability that they've started producing acid secretions and spreading them all over the internet.
1,"Opening yourself up to someone you are dating and appearing desperate, vulnerable and possibly rejected is the worse outcome of opening up.  Watching and listening to Brene Browne has taught to express my love and emotions. Allow anyone to see me for who I am. Let them in and see me,  the real me.  No more pretending to be cool, calm and collected.  No more pretending that I am not hurt, that I am not missing you,  that I don’t really, really love you. 
Vulnerability is the key to happiness.  I an using the key more often and I have learned to be stronger and accept uncertainty.  Vulnerability and uncertainty."

1,"Vulnurability needs to be addressed by us all. As a 18 year old college student surrounded by guy friends in my dorm, we have all become experts of pushing down our fear and shame and deepest vulnerabilities because it's easy to blend into the crowd. It saddens me. Recently I've noticed that I have shame for just having emotions. And that needs to stop!"

1,"...What she's saying isn't exactly groundbreaking. If you take a look around and think for a few minutes it's quiet obvious. Most people are unauthentic, and yes in order to connect with people you have to be vulnerable. I knew that when I was 13."

1,i didnt learn anything new the Quran teaches you this in a matter of minutes where i took her years of researching
1,"Thank you Brene. Those feelings of worthiness are only accessible after we learn to have compassion for ourselves and let go of the shame and blame for our past experiences and the beliefs that our worth is determined by anyone or anything else. Becoming vulnerable and open is the result of feeling safe within ourselves. Genuine self-love makes it possible to love others, and life itself, without the pain of how we will be judged."
1,"exactly
we pretent perfection or at least flawlessness
and are severely hurt when put on the spot or questioned or fail ..
todays hyper protected, over the top coddled, instantly screeching and safe space demanding generation .. is void of reality .. the problem goes so far .. that even speech is severely policed ..
i hope the currently jungest generation (it seems like it has) learned from that and grows up resilient and with classical liberal values (neither progressive nor conservative .. both lack too much from the other side)"

1,"As someone who grew up with an eating disorder and feared sharing this experience due to shame, this TedTalk on the merits of vulnerability perfectly captures why we need to connect in order to overcome obstacles and live a more meaningful life."
1,"Her thoughts on shame near the beginning of her presentation reminded me of one of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite TV shows: 

""Pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame."" 

This talk also made me realize I might have a vulnerability problem as well and that I should probably seek out help with it. Very insightful and eye-opening."
1,"Vulnerability just recently fixed my relationship.What a difference,  what a relief!"
2,I love the sly dig at narcissists at 
1,"Hmm, I'm not vulnerable to anyone because I don't need to be? My problems are no one else's business and I can deal with them 100% by myself? Is that still a bad thing lol"
1,"No. They had courage because they had a safe space to be able to express themselves. Fear comes from being taught fear and shame of ourselves from a very young age. We are TAUGHT that we are not worthy as children; as adults, we then have to come out of what others have defined us as children."
1,"Excelent video, makes we think about the connections we don’t make and avoid by fear of looking weak or either not able, human connection may look deeper than this.

2,How existential! This talk is great!
1,"I've seen this video atleast 5 times in the past year, since it was part of an English assignment. Each time I see this video, it hits me deeper and deeper. The power of vulnerability is so real, I've never been happier in my life being vulnerable with the ones I love. Not weak, I still set boundaries and avoid toxic relationships - but being vulnerable with those you feel safe with, is golden. Although I find this true, I give my thanks to Jesus because he truly transformed me from the inside out to feel worthy. I thank God every day that He made this happen for me. Thankyou, Lord and thank you Brene Brown for sharing this."
1,How did I just found this talk now? How have I lived  years not knowing her? This is amazing!
1,"I would love to meet you, or go to a speech or hearing.. wauw. I admire you're personality and world-view"
1,"This so defines me that I feel like leaping 1,000 ft into the air!!  I do feel to go a step further.  Cause there is one’s own vulnerability but may not be anothers.  Regarding the preverbal elephant in the room, slaying that sucker in one felled swoop.  Im NOT the one to run to deal with that elephant.  Because I’ve learned that doesn’t work for everyone and such frontal direct dialogue can drive them further away.  It’s like children who are afraid of fireman during a blazing fire and bury deeper into their hiding spot.  I’ve learned what’s good for me doesn’t mean it’s the remedy for everyone else.  And honestly, I see it as a bit controlling and insensitive.  Instead I seek to determine their triggers, their shadows, and talk in their language so they will be empowered to come to the light of “vulnerability”.  Vulnerability and emotional vomiting are two vastly different things.  The first is a state of being and the second well it’s just unhealthy."
2,Well that is one of the best things I’ve ever seen.
2,My favorite video! 15 million views! Wow!
1,"Does she mean by this that we shouldn't try to change ourselves? I think not, but I also think most others will see it that way. This doesn't mean you shouldn't strive to improve yourself, but rather NOT to adopt the lacking-empathy behavior and I-don't-give-a-damn attitude."

1,I have followed Ms. Brown for years...I am so happy she has continued to speak and spread her message true authenticity is so rare yet reveals what makes humans capable of such amazing things...when we own who we are we can connect so much better. Help each other heal

1,Just turn on Closed Captioning! :)
1,Yes same my therapist played this video during our session
1,had my very first therapy session today via zoom (i’m 17) and my therapist said to watch this video and journal about it. i’m so glad to finally start my healing journey
1,"No.  It is not shame.  Yes it is fear, but it is also anger and rebellion fuelling the need to create change at a social level.  The suffragettes are an example.  Black lives matter is another.  Equal pay for equal work is another.  Some may feel shame.  I feel rage"
1,What an inspiring beautiful woman...
2,"I love this. Very inspiring! Thank you, Brene Brown."
1,"You can't be in debt, you can be in a system that claims you're in debt.

However you can have a certain amount of time to live, and eventually your body will stop... so in this sense fate exists. And so one should do the best to have a happy life. But debt holds a lot of people down. And that to me isn't fair when a world can exist with out the need for debt."
1,who else is watching in December 2019?
1,"I don't necessarily believe I'm worthy of love and belonging and yet I feel loved. Doesn't anyone understand what Grace is? You have to join the community like a church or something. That has been absolutely essential for me, especially if you don't have a family of your own. And you have to embrace the shame that you feel and use it to reform yourself because it comes from within and it's telling you something, to stop doing what you're doing that's wrong, otherwise you wouldn't have the shame that comes from within. Anything else is pride, and pride is a huge blocker of connection. So many people don't know what Grace is or sin is. These two things are absent from our modern lexicon but they put a huge role in my being now and in my connection with others. Try to serve others because if you're serving others you'll always be welcome and honored but that again requires not having too much pride"

1,"This was not a bad talk, but I really did not find it as profound as others seem to have found it. Also, i'm slightly sceptical of the 'data' she keep referring to. How can one accurately measure 'courage' or 'vulnerability'."
1,"""You're imperfect, you're wired for struggle, but you're worthy of love and belonging"" dear Brené Brown all these realities, along with connection, courage, vulnerability, shame, are intricately woven in the account of the Gospels, in the personhood of Christ. Your research is displayed in those ancient scriptures! Could it be that Christ has been overtaken by fearful, angry, controlling and ""perfect"" people so we no longer want to listen to the story of this man's vulnerability, courage and fullness? Maybe Mathew, Mark, Luke and John have something interesting to tell us, even these days, about what it means to be a human <3"
1,Vulnerability is so scary but ....... Healing
1,"""If you can't measure it, it doesn't exist."" I agree. What a lot of people don't realize, though, is that there are many ways to measure a thing. Empirically, spiritually, psychologically, etc. Like it says in Harry Potter: ""‎Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?"" This statement is why psychology works. If people think something is real, they can be affected by it. If you can be affected by something, that is its measurement."

1,It scares me how she had to spend years to figure this out even the people in the comments acting as if this is some sort revelation is terrifying.  There always seems to be some escape in avoiding the most obvious of truths.
1,the only part that resonates with me currently is the numbing part & it makes sense. dont know how im suppose to fix that
2,JUST CAME HERE AFTER LISTENING TO HER NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY. LOT OF LOVE AND RESPECT FOR HER. THANK YOU <3
2,Why this in my recommendation 7 years later
1,The buddhists got it right a few hundreds of years ago.
1,It's funny because his comment only had 2 grammar mistakes. There is a difference between spelling and grammar.
1,"I'm doing a day of Brene Brown, and it's changing my life... so great to have inspirational leaders - thought modelers we can follow... thank you."
2,This video and this woman are perfect. I was confused about emotions. But now I feel good. Thank you so much.
1,Forgiven: Are you about done? You have posted vehement disagreement to 20+ posts on this thread and every one you interject God.  You have your way and your perspective which obviously depends on your faith. This is fine up until the point where you start criticizing other perspectives and paths to health that don't agree with yours. God my be your solution but there are lots of people who do not believe in god who might find this perspective useful. Please STFU.  
2,Thank you red_heart

1,I have never heard of this woman til yesterday watching the Netflix special.   What a blessing and a light !
1,I don't see what the fuss is about.
1,"Heard about this Ted talk from TV show “Grownish”. Never thought I’d love it. Y’all search out name, products and stuff from movies too or I’m just nuts?"
1,"Great talk. My only disagreement is on the point of medication. Some of us are medicated so that we are able to interact meaningfully and nondestructively with the rest of the world. Some people, on the other hard, are medicated unnecessarily. We just have to watch making blanket statements that medications are bad. Admitting I'm on medications makes me very vulnerable, and thats OK."
1,"Yes, vulnerability is the key to divinity, as a spiritual teacher once told me. But what I now realise is that in itself vulnerability isn't enough. One has to realise how to be here and be present. Without presence we can never heal the shame that lies behind the refusal to surrender. It's also true that there are precious few people who have the courage to accept these simple truths; but that number will grow over time, I believe."
2,"I like this but still wish that she would not say "" I was like"", that´s sooooooooooo bullshit childish like."
1,Totally true. And abt life.
1,Serrose red_heart
1,"@sausage4mash Please define a very average mind. When you're done, define how such a mind could be expected to measure such immeasurable things as human emotions and behavior. Now define how a perfect mind would do the same. I'm sure a genius like you should have no trouble creating the absolute and indubitable standards of excellence required in the process. By this point you should have enough material to publish a best selling book about your discoveries. Unless you go crazy before that."
1,"She is sooo bang on, funny, and direct. She reminds me of what I had gone through. I was and taught that type A was the way to be. I had to re-learn the measuring stick wasn't and never be the answer. Life has been better ever since. This is a must share. :)"

1,"living with vulnerability is even found on mathematical level. Programs that pledge to find the perfect solution run ""infinitely"" much longer than programs that are ok with the second best solution. People can be stuck investing their lives to perfect something that will barely pay off. Cut the corner (a bit) and create!"

1,Reading her book right now !!!
1,"""Ahahah, God.."" I felt that too hard"
1, got the power... 
1,I did and I am still confused about it but I will not give up on trying to understand what Brené Brown said until I get it and apply it to myself so I too can and will live my life to the fullest extent
2,"youre imperfect, youre wired for struggle; but you're worthy of love and belonging.

2,"Wow, that is such a beautiful talk, thank you Brené for your openness, your courage and vulnerability!:)"
1,am I the only one from pornhub??

2,"I am absolutely terrified of vulnerability,and this was great! Feel her warm energy through the screen :)"
1,Whoever gave this a thumbs down.....DOESN'T GET IT! This is very valuable Brene. Thank you!
2,"I love this! more than the intellect is the sincerity; I got teary-eyed watching. we all want to appear strong most of the time, and are afraid to be seen vulnerable which is also part of our being alive. Thank you, Brene and TED! <3"

2,still watching - still love it
2,great insight
1,Super powerful! Amazing insights! I relate so much to being the one who comes in with a measuring stick and tries to fix things that other people couldn't...
1,so many wonderful takeaways here - a big thank-you
1,My therapist told me to watch this video I think that's the way I am in therapy too thanks smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes very funny but true.
1,"Saw this when it 1st came out...and I have been in love with her words ever since!!!
"
2,it's called being smart
1,that's a powerful word
2,Thank You!
2,Thank you for being a blessing and sharing! You are so BRAVE!!
1,"She keeps stating things as facts and gives very ,little to back them up.  For someone who boasts her self as a researcher this felt very biased, anecdotal, and cherry picked.   Granted she is a qualitative researcher but she could have given something better than this garbage.  Also what was with those images, they felt very misplaced and confusing?"
1,I needed to watch this again todayfolded_hands_light_skin_tone
1,This was enlightening to say the least.. I believe being vulnerable is a sign if weakness an they way it was explained in the video was the total opposite.. I'm glad my therapist recommended this video now I see why he wants me to work on my perception of being vulnerable.. I got some work to do 
2,thank you
1,Chat gpt suggest me this video
1,My therapist advised me to listen to this woman too. She’s funny.

2,She is a true inspiration!
1,"Phoney or fake vulnerability is something people use sometimes. Others see vulnerability as a sign of weakness or lacking self-respect, regardless of how enlightened we are or think we are or how full of live etc. etc. beware"
2,I LOVE LISTENING TO HER TALK BECAUSE SHE IS VERY AUTHENTIC.. SHE IS VERY REAL.. THE AUDIENCE ARE REACTING BECAUSE THE  SPEAKER CAN CONNECT TO THEIR RESPECTIVE EXPERIENCES.  GOD BLESS YOUR ENDEAVORS!!!
2,NO IT'S NOT OKAY
1,"I found this video extremely, EXTREMELY depressing."
1,"Great talk. 
She mentions two groups, and unfortunately for me I'm part of the second. So it was pretty hard to watch without crying because that's how I feel and think about myself. Hopeful things change.
I really enjoy her TED talks."
2,Absolutely the truth! Thanks for sharing Brene. This truth is so needed!!!
1,"Came from her book, Daring Greatly. Everything she's said has made my life easier to understand--I've literally never felt so heard. There's a part in her book where she mentions that vulnerability is actually used by some as a defense mechanism against being really vulnerable. I never thought that it would make so much sense. Thank you."

1,"im the most vulnerable person you'd ever meet. I cannot stand up for myself no matter how much I want to. I have been told by many many people that I'm ""too nice"" that I'm a ""pushover"" and im ""delicate"". Over the years, especially more recently, I've been proud of it. I have finally learnt to accept my soft personality and I couldn't of done without this video, Jennifer Aniston and Selena Gomez."
0,Such a bad ass. 
1,@khatack especially everywhere else
1,"I don't resent my parents. I resent the fact that they taught me how to numb like a pro since the word go. They didn't even know it was going on, because of their upbringing and how they have lived their entire lives. I'm not surprised that my folks rarely socialise. They have never hosted any big parties or reunions.  And the people they do socialise with on a regular basis. are just like them. I still love them. but i'm constantly reminded of how mediocre their way of thinking and feeling seems to be. The worst part is i'm not sure if I can ever shake the bad habits I have picked up and developed during my upbringing. And i'm not sure if i can ever let go of this enormous sense of regret. for all the possibilities for fulfilling connections that I have let pass me by due to this constant numbing. But thats for me to find out."

2,But she is lovely.
1,That IS awesome!

1,I've watched heaps of Ted talks today her and the schools killing creativity have resonated with me the most so far.. deep
2,My Replika recommended this to me.

1,I watch this talk every time I'm struggling with big emotions. Learning to live with courage has changed my life and how I relate to people.
1,"remember it's a rorshack, sir"
1,my reality looks exactly like THIS
1,"I can't believe there are negative comments on this video. It was absolute gold. Vulnerability is something all of us need to learn and accept and she articulates that perfectly. In her own words ""Don't try to win over the haters; you are not a jackass whisperer."" "
1,"I write Brené Brown's books. Kind of obvious, I would have thought."
1,"Wow, this video made me cry and recognize that I have avoided to feel vulnerability since my last breakup. I needed this talk"
1,Exactly what I needed to hear :)  Excellent talk.
2,This is just perfect
1,"Anyone reading this, please help. I need some advice.

I’m one of the most vulnerable, courageous, compassionate and authentic men I know, yet I struggle with self worth. Even though I create connection with others easily, I often feel misunderstood and under appreciated. I have hundreds of people who care for me but I still feel deeply alone. I have no place I belong and no one to call my own. 

What should I do?"
1,"This message was important for me to hear. Love her authenticity, her imperfection. She is modeling her point."
2,"Great Video, God Bless Her."
0,"What do think about this? I’m curious. I’m one you would have avoidedwinking_face_with_tongue “it doesn’t matter if it’s feel guilt or shame I feel. Guilt and shame come from the same place. I am bad. I feel bad, I’m bad. I didn’t listen to that person who needed me, I dumped on her instead. I feel guilt/shame. Guilt/shame is about me being a bad person. What if I felt remorse or sad instead. I regret and feel sad I didn’t listen to that person who really needed me. I did a “bad” thing, my integrity tells me so. I have remorse, I feel sad about what I did, not that I’m a bad person. I did a bad thing. My job now is say, “I’m sorry I didn’t listen to you when you needed me. I used your sadness and anger to dump my sadness and angry on you. I’m going to work on fixing this. It’s ok if you don’t forgive me. I’m sorry.” I must say The thing I did is real. How to go forward isn’t. This is not my thinking or my idea, research, it’s something I read on how to ‘get rid of guilt’."

0,Being vulnerable puts you in danger of being abused and even killed. Stop spreading this new buzz word for your own gain. You are putting people in harms way.
1,"This explains it so well....i suffer from.ptsd and I embrace it although it is the single most horrible trauma I've been through, if it wasn't for having it I would not know my strength and I would not have found in every way it has changed me...."
1,"I was having sort of paranoid intrusive thoughts a few minutes before watching this video and started to have some kind of panic attack. After I calmed down, I watched this and when I tell you I was sobbing at the end. This was such a wonderful and insightful video that really hit close to home. I feel very vulnerable right now but maybe it's not such a bad thing? Thank you so much for this talk, lots of love to everyone!♡"

Where are the best of these videos on Youtube?
1,"Shinkajo,  No you obviously said HP was like God because you put both in teh same category like many do with God and invisible unicorns. Now you state that a belief in God is ""totally random and useless.""  Huh? I guess you do not think much of theology or philosophy.  Can't live that way.  You really don't even though it seems like you think you do.  "

1,"I watched this for the first time years ago in my senior yr of college. It profoundly impacted me, as I fully identified as a ""Wholehearted."" I carried Brene's message with me for years. I rewatched years later, after spiraling into a life with an anxiety disorder and depression and it now resonates in an even more powerful way. And to think I understood vulnerability then... This woman is a genius who has hit the nail on the head in every which way and I feel eternally grateful for the self awareness, healing, and acceptance she has inspired in myself as well as countless others. Thank you Brene!"
1,i truly do not know what you're talking about brother
1,"This video changed my negative thinking.  I didn't believe I was worthy of love & belonging.  Brene set out the steps of courage, compassion, connection and vulnerability.  I feel hope!"
1,That's it and I came to this very same understanding recently this grew very gradually and I wanted it to grow as a bottom up processing development. The Cluster B personality people and others too of course but mainly the Cluster B people suffer from feelings of extreme shame and they think they are unworthy of love. They also have adopted this feeling from their parents and Dr. Bruce Lipton said that those things can even be inherited because feelings of unworthiness can embed themselves into a person's DNA as strange as this sounds it is true because of epigenetics. But we can also heal this pain even if we inherited things like that from our parents genetically.
1,"This was very good. I am not sure that I agree with not being able to show compassion for others until we can care about ourselves. Definitely BETTER compassion for others has come with learning to love myself. But I've always been compassionate & caring, even when I was kicking myself. I'm in what I believe is the middle of my awakening & it was VERY messy in the beginning. I felt & looked like I was losing my ever lovin mind. I STILL have days like that on occasion. I just don't let them consume me anymore. I do think I've become willing to be more vulnerable with people. And as I ""live"" in the rooms of 12 step recovery, it's important. What I don't know is what other people see/hear/feel when I speak. I know I've felt less empathetic lately & I really hate that. But it is what it is for now. Thank you Miss Brown. I'm going to listen to more. I appreciated that I could laugh while I enjoyed the lesson. Blessings Sister folded_handsbouquet"

1,Very nice and inspiring tedtalk. Does anybody understand why did she decide to spend one year on therapy?
1,Fraud was a raging coke head and sexist slob.  Carl Jung was a genius though. 
1," reminds me of my therapist sharing this mantra with me: ""Worth from birth."""
1,"I agree that alot of people are phonies,given into peer pressure and social fads.it takes courage to go amongst your peers that have a strict idealogical dogma and tell them that u dont buy into that shat anymore.thats courage,you might lose your job and will be a turd in a punch bowl.group think is not courage ,it is cowardice.it is to lose your real self and become another brick in the wall"
1,Had to pause my grownish for this
1,"Yes! The answer to connection IS vulnerability! I know that I am more connected to my husband when we are completely honest and open, leaving nothing in the space, but this is taking it to a whole new level. I am now in the inquiry of, ""how can I be more vulnerable in EVERY moment""? Being real and vulnerable is BEAUTIFUL!! I am letting go of ""doing it right and perfect"" and bringing in more of ""just be me."" Thank U for going down your own path of vulnerability and sharing your 'research' w/us! "

2,I looooved this talk. Thank you so much for sharing this with the world.

2,Great research storytelling this was.thumbs_up
1,"Over the years since this was first released, I revisit this TED Talk often and always discover something new. Dr. Bréné, thank you for sharing your findings and your story with the world."
1,if only it was as easy as she says.
1,its a bit american hipster nonsense ....
1,"Ted Talks are subtitled by volunteers? What cheapskates. If they're that desperate to save money, why don't they engage volunteer speakers with no previous experience? Just another example of the ""how hard can it be"" disdain for professionalism -- anybody's professionalism but one's own."

I discovered when I share with groups of people and FORGET about ""how I look or sound"" that they laugh & cry along with me because I give it my darnedest best effort to be HONEST. Scary! But since all of us can relate to the messiness of our lives & junk drawers, we can then joke about it. Ahhh, that's ""perfection""!"

1,"Oh, so the banana nut muffin means xanax?"
1,This is on point!
1,"Wonderful speech but what she calls Vulnerability and talk a lot about it, is - Pride - one of Seven deadly sins. It is also called - Ego, what do we think about ourselves. Proud people are doomed to live miserable life because they pursue perfection in almost everything, but it's impossible. The more Ego is inflated - the more excrutiating consequences for each individual. Only God can be perfect."
1,"I love everything she says until she gets to the “ obese” part.  Brene, I’d like you to know that not every fat person ate their way to fatness, or are fat because they’re having psychological issues.  Please have a look at the science of Health At Every Size and learn that not every soul is naturally thin.  Genetics, illness, medication, disability, yo-yo dieting due to cultural pressure to be thin , socioeconomics, inequality contribute to these things. In fact, many cope with stress by going on diets and developing highly restrictive eating disorders to feel “ in control”which can lead to binging and purging. Many therapists and nutritionists and therapists have reached out to you to connect so to better inform you, but we haven’t heard from you.  A huge part of vulnerability and courage is learning to be okay with yourself just as you are right this minute."
1,You can't measure an electron because the act of measuring it changes it. So if not being able to measure something means it doesn't exist.. then nothing we know exists
1,Thank you for making this available! Brene Brown's words have been so inspiring for us in creating our videos!
2,incredible thanks a lot once again!!!
1,Going through the comments makes me feel even more alone. Yay vulnerability. Smh
1,i will give this link to my therapist
1,"This TEDtalk was suggested to me by my really great college roommate/friend (who is actually now a social work Smith graduate) a couple years ago when I went through a really tough breakup. I watched it so many times back then but had no idea that eventually it would guide my life. Here I am two years later, another heartbreak later, and I’m watching it again to sorta recenter myself once again. It’s actually helping me understand and be ok with being left by the love of my life because he truly had vulnerability issues and felt as though he didn’t deserve me. When I say this talk helps me recenter myself, I mean that it’s helping me remember that I really embrace vulnerability and that my ability to embrace it and love again came from this video and from the wisdom and knowledge of Brené Brown. Being able to embrace it reminds me that I need someone in my life that embraces it in the same way."
1,"I appreciate her insights and the content but I would like to see this truncated and the fat trimmed. A lot her cutsie folksy style and mom jokes are kinda cringey and take away, distract, or bore me where I tune out and am like get on with your point. Obviously she’s perfect and there is no room for critical commentary on here based on the preponderance of praise and wow’d commenters. Don’t get me wrong - I like her; her points, and message but 6-7 mins vs 20 w the emphatic pauses and paced for impact rigamerole."
2,"Wow, so moving!"
2,This was EXCELLENT!!!!  Thank you TED!
1,"I’m afraid of meeting new people because of what they’ll think of me. I don’t approach people and let them approach me. And when I’m not approached, I’m sad and lonely and fall into a depression. I don’t want to live my life like that anymore so I decided to sign up for a social event where I’ll be forced to put myself out there and be vulnerable for the sake of making human connections and being happy. The social event is 3 weeks away and I think about it every single day and I’m constantly trying to find ways out of it. I’m 99% sure I’ll end up going and I’m 99% it will end up being a good time but God, i hope putting myself out there eventually gets easier. This feeling is terrifying."
1,"This video touched me to the core, but as a victim/survivor of narcissistic abuse, where your soul was kicked every day, it's hard to show your emotions or be openly vulnerable for fear of being re-victimized or taken advantage of again and again. It really is a slippery slope, showing vulnerability or becoming a doormat for people. I'm also aware that hiding your vulnerabilities can make you a slave to being perfect. In my mind vulnerability is NOT weakness, but others may not see it that way and use it against us. That has always been my dilemma. Doesn't being vulnerable just set you up for further abuse? Any thoughts or suggestions on that?﻿"

Be you authentic self and let yourself feel! People are running away life. I'll never understand why. It's so easy to love everyone and try to make this world a better place! Slow down and see the beauty in life and make others lives better even if they don't appreciate it. You'll be happy, free and content! red_heartsmiling_face_with_smiling_eyes"

In the thirteen years I've dealt with my condition, one that leaves me in constant agony & using a walking stick, I can honestly say I wouldn't change it. It's part of who I am, and I'm happy with that person. Hopefully, this will inspire others to embrace themselves."

The more you miss someone the better your life has been with that someone.

1,"Really good ted talk I enjoyed it a lot. Although, her opinion on religion is very wrong. I'm religious and I believe in grace and understanding. At the center of my belief is that the best way to express my belief in God is to love others. The BEST way to serve God is to serve others, no matter what their beliefs. It's actually quite sad that someone this educated, educated in people no less, believes that religion is ""I'm right, your wrong, shut up""."

1,"Last year, whilst working in a prominent University, I was a party to the way in which these very teachings were misused. A colleague exposed herself and sought the assistance of HR due to targeted and bullying behaviours of a particular individual in management who blatantly set her up to fail and refused to consult upon major decisions in relation to process and business practice. The HR professional, who held a psychology degree, decided, upon hearing a highly vulnerable plea for intervention (with supporting evidence no less) then proceeded to suggest that she “should listen to some BB talks” and provided her with some links. Gaslighting 101.

How can one be more vulnerable than when daring to report targeted and bullying behaviours of a superior?

Fortunately for my colleague, she retained her job. I wasn’t so lucky, despite having been a victim of the same.

I never had BB podcasts suggested to me but I was told that “maybe you should be more EXPLICIT” after EXPLICITLY outlining my experiences and the abuses of power and privilege at play.

Unfortunately the current trending social narratives weren’t in support of my individual (and attested to WITH DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE) experiences.

Be forever wary of trending narratives and codes of practice."

1,"Every system is destructable. So everything is vulnerable. So everybody gets beaten to death? No! Your statement isn't about logic. 
You don't admit your vulnerability because you are afraid. This anxiety will lead you to utter solitude & a numb as stuck life til death, Because nobody will be able to help you where your system is incomplete, because you don't show. 
Our needs are not managable alone. It's not what evolutions goes for."

1,This research forget so much about strength . This video is unbalanced . Everything can be simplify but by looking only at the negative words vulnerable is not the word to find what she was looking for . Solidarity is word . Can belief 6 years and she did not research Jesus candy or Martin Luther king . She did not understand nonviolent to understand. And also phycology already knew the answer so much books .  Well anyways of anyone understand that trust is earn not give and ethics about stuff . Also courage is a combination . Nvm If you need help in anything just choose it really choose it and follow your own word and you will find what your looking for
1,This is amazing and all true but she doesn't fully explain how to get there to a place where you feel like you are worthy of love and belonging. Personally I think it takes talking to a counselor so really air out the closet but I think you need to slowly be careful with weeding out people in your life that hurt you and keeping people who love you and remind you are worthy whether you believe it at the time. Then you feel safer opening up to the good people in your life. But you need to be willing to weed out people who hurt you. Like friends or family. I think that's why a lot of people become more comfortable with themselves in college because they can really choose who they want to spend time with and makes them feel good about themselves and they kick the people who don't to the curb with little guilt. So I think it's best just to surround yourself with people who love you. You don't have to love yourself at the time but you need to feel safe enough to vulnerable with them

I've also found that I am so much happier than much of the sad world around me while people unload their life stories and feelings onto me. I've always had the philosophies that she describes. And until now they've just been philosophies. Now they are psychological, validated studies. And as an aspiring psychotherapist I am thrilled to know I will get to dive into information like this and not just philosophize but to prove my ideas that can help so many people out there."
2,This is true for me

I'm okay with being vulnerable but how can I create connections if I cant selectively choose to not be numb?

edit: I found this   https://www.thechelseapsychologyclinic.com/blog/why-do-i-feel-numb/  I'm going to try these to see if i can get to know myself more emotionally and validate my feelings more. maybe it'll help."

1,"I REALLY don’t like the notion that if someone can’t feel shame they can’t feel empathy. That’s crazy!!! We are all taught to be ashamed of everything since were little! I’d say that truly not feeling ASHAMED is the ultimate empathy because you understand that we don’t have to be ashamed. Guilt and shame are very different things. I would say a genuine shamelessness is a key factor of my personality; an almost pathological honesty and recognition of all my flaws and failure. I of course feel very guilty if I do something wrong or hurt someone. But guilt means you believe you’ve done something wrong. Shame is believing you ARE something wrong.

I am not something wrong. I have the courage to be imperfect! So much so that I feel completely isolated because I’ve worked sooooo hard to not blow my brains out through severe abuses, chronic illnesses, near fatal injuries and the loss of almost everything that ever mattered to me, that most people think I’m fine! 

I’m not even remotely fine! 

Even THERAPISTS think I’m more ok than I ever am because I can speak so openly and without cajoling or force about the most horrible things that have ever happened or that I’ve ever done.

Don’t trick people into thinking that honesty brings love or connection into your life. 

It’s not true, and it’s a very dangerous paradigm the person that believes that falls into.

It happened to me."

1,"Our job is to say you aren't perfect but you are worthy of loving...many never get that growing up.. We need to know we are truly loved and are worthy... True relationship with God heals that, and sets us free... Sad that religion has shut people down instead of helping them heal... This teaching is basically true christianity... But sadly not in churches... I kept thinking about how Jesus embraces humanity and heals and makes us whole inside... But religion kills the soul."

1,the power of vulnerability versus the power of targeting
1,"a few weeks ago my counselor suggested i watch this video. at 31 I've done my best not to cry around others and i got GOOD at holding back tears no matter how strong the urge to cry was if other people were around. last summer only a week or 2 after my 31st birthday (...my birthday was 2 days before i met my current roommate) i had what id consider a breakdown. my ex roommate had just moved out and for one month i lived alone and in the middle of said month i broke down! That's when I decided i was fed up. I'm not gonna avoid everyone when I'm being emotional anymore. So i got a new counselor whom I really enjoy talking to. In my last session with her I brought up my issues with crying and that I feel my roommate is the one I want to open up to (not just by talking, because I'm a big talker with a lot of people). I trust him because I know that he would never betray someone he calls friend. It was after our conversation tonight that I finally decided to take my counselor's advice and watch this video. Basically... I was right about him and I'm going to take what she said in this video and little at a time give it a shot... starting with him. We'll see how it goes, but so far I have hope."
1,"The kindly success frequently signal because nephew lately command up a puzzling damage. parched, dispensable hot"
1,"I don't know what my therapist was thinking when she sent me this. This doesn't make any sense.

According to this, I have to feel shame to feel vulnerable??? I have felt shame, but it never stopped me from being open.

The moment I understood that I didn't want to be like the people who abused me, I opened up to find answers that I just couldn't find at home. Friends, teachers, strangers, I opened up to everyone but my abusers. I learned very important lessons, self awareness, and about how many different kinds of people there is. I learned so much about myself I eventually was able find my own coping mechanism for my anxiety and depression.

 Eventually I talked to the right people at the right time that lead me to therapy. While I'm still working to get out of that toxic environment, there are a few things that I haven't been able to focus on or understand until now.

One of those being that I feel a 'distance' in relationships. I first noticed it in highschool with a group of friends. It became a large factor as to why I broke up with my boyfriend soon after we became a couple. People tell me ""oh he just wasn't the one"", which is very frustrating, he had nothing to do with how I was feeling and is a great guy.

I kept trying to figure it out. At first I thought, ""maybe it's abandonment issues?"", but I only know two ways people with abandonment issues cope: They either sabotage their own relationships or avoid relationships. I don't do either. I make connections, I enjoy my friends, and I love them. But there's still this distance.

So me and my therapist concluded that I am looking for something to replace the relationship I never got with my family. That and my desperation to be known (this came as a result of not being listened to, leading to a lot of pain).

So how do I break out of that? And how do I feel close to my friends? Is it a matter of vulnerability? Have I never experienced vulnerability simply because I have never been ashamed to talk? Am I incapable of feeling vulnerable? Or is it I never noticed I'm being vulnerable because I do it so often?

This video honestly raised so many questions for me and I still have no answers to anything.

Edit: I think another part of it is that out of my desperation to be understood, I hate hiding any part of myself. I hate having a ""mask"". So maybe that's part of it too?"

1,Today's world tells us vulnerability is weakness and we need to be strong. When the truth is that to be strong we need to let ourselves be vulnerable.

Shame was a seed planted in consciousness as it is part of the process of separation from everything else, exemplified by the cradle/hold of the mother and the anchorment, anvil, rule of the father.

The end could/should have a bit about the difference between ""I am enough"" and ""I don't need/deserve to improve"" Just earlier in the talk you mentioned people being addicted, obese etc. etc....well, thinking ""I am enough"" is part of the problem with those things. There's a BIG difference between loving and respecting yourself, and letting yourself be a self-centered person who has no motivation/reason to improve. I am enough, sure, but I love myself and deserve to make myself and my life better, when and where possible."

1,"As Shrek would say I believe, I believe, I believe, I am worthy! Its a choice you make every day. So is trust. How can you trust anyone else if you can't trust yourself. First it has to start with you. Much love to everyone reading this."
1,This chick is revolutionizingly amazing. She really tops all psychologies.
2,This is great!
0,To me this is disturbing and frustrating.
1,"So how do you become vulnerable? Id say firstly to accept that you are imperfect, and then on top of that showing and expressing those imperfections to the world."
2,Love this so much!
2,This is much easier to understand if you believe in God. You are loved.
1,POV: the girl from Tik tok told you to watch this
1,"It's abominable... everyone knows the word he's going for is ""crey""."
1,"I'm afraid most of that went over my head and I don't know why , I'll have to watch it again. Is it that it was aimed at phycologists? Makes me feel a bit inferior for not getting it."
2,Wow. I thought this was incredible.
1,MADE MY LIFEred_heart
2,This is also known as faith.  Stepping out into the great unknown. 
1,"My goodness, this is such a powerful talk but for the love of God, what was she thinking when she put on this outfit? She looks like she just got out of bed and the shirt is 2 sizes too small. Couldn't you afford a jacket after all her books and talks? Come on Brene, I almost couldn't watch this despite the powerful message because of your lack of respect for your audience shown by your dress sense."
1,essential for whole love…. leading to  real joy and happiness
1,“Stories are just data with a soul” dang.
1,"Can you describe what the difference between feeling you are worthy, vs. feeling 'entitled'?"
1,So much rad.
1,Powerful and moving...
1,"Wouaa this is one of the best talk I had seen! Amazing research and amazing oratory quality 
Thank you for sharing your work"
1,"""If you cannot measure it, it does not exist""... most mind-numbing, creativity-killing, ridiculously self-centered statement possible.

Glad she out-grew such a lousy perception and became the woman that was able to stand there and talk to a bunch of strangers about her own vulnerability. D.R."
0,what does shame do
1,"red_heart Awesome information and lots of food for thought. Love her funny, witty and sincere delivery. "
1,"At 19 minutes, the reason companies don't ""own up"" to stuff is the company attorneys and image experts are told to focus on the now.  its all about immediate losses, and profits.  they don't think about how the company will be viewed or how profitable they will be in 10 years."
1,Capricorn people are not ashamed or shy. That is why they go far in life. I wish I can be like them. I try though.
1,what about freud who compiled case studies on dreams and desires? that basically evolved into cognitive behavoural research today. just because they are collected case studies doesn't mean they have no scientific merit. it's qualitative research. 
1,Those whom i've shown the vulnerable side of me has not wasted the chance to walk all over me. So... yeah
1,"As generic & cliche as it sounds, ''I am enough'' is something that I really needed for myself. "
1,The most beautiful woman on Earth. The most authentic talk I've ever heard. Thank you Brené red_heart
1,"Brene Brown is surely good enough, though her ***** wasn't long enough! This is a must-watch for everyone! "
1,I enjoyed the talk even if I disagree with the message completely.
1,Who else is here from the suicide hotline
2,bravo! this is brilliant!
1,I am just here so I will get an A
1,it's an eye opener
1,Shame is the fear of the negative actions of others... or looking at your own negative actions in third person.
1,"I really like the sentence of parents's job  loudly_crying_facesad_but_relieved_face ""I know you are not ok, and you are struggling, but you deserve love"" I love you  Brene brown..  red_heart"
1,"You had me crying at 12min. This is who we are. American's force ourselves to numb feeling. Thank you, for all you do."
0,woah this was so painful to listen to but it was necessary
2,This ages well
1,that's all she had and it was enough ! awesome
1,I got chills down my spine while listening to this. Amazing :)
1,"YouTube knows more about me than family, how did they know about this?"
1,"She just put into words something I've been struggling with for the past years of my life. I am insecure and I hide it so well, and that's another way to try to be not vulnerable.
I'm just glad somebody verbalized it. I'm going to try to follow her advice ' let people SEE me.' I've been always hiding myself and never truly showing people my true self completely,..."
1,"I sent this video link to my father to open a dialogue. He sent me a link to a medical science paper titled: ""It's All In Your Head,"" thereby ending our dialogue. So...THAT happened. 
Lord save me!
Thank you Brene Brown for your research, and how you present it and make it meaningful. :-) (I don't know how to make that accent mark in your name on my phone...sorry!)"

1,very informative and profound.

1,"Of course people leave positive comments. They are hardly going to say they are just out for themselves but civilization shows that if you are not constantly vigilant people will take everything from you. In my city people need door and window locks and bars on their windows and if not they would lose every possession they have. People are killing each other over oil and who's God is better. The world is a dangerous and violent place, people are not good. You'll learn this. "
1,do you believe in facts?
1,This is profoundly beautiful
1,This may be the most impressionable talk I've ever heard.
1,There is one for a lot of countries that were decided by the UN if it happened. If they did land im sure the powers that be would be worried about power shifting away from them so we would probably try and start a war with any aliens we come in contact with. 
1,"she smart. she see we have to be so scaredy yet we can walk thru, with the healpings of otters."
1,"This is really worth watching. Having been in the shame business, I would add that a lot of church entertainment is an effort to medicate against shame and works against vulnerability. Good stuff here. "
1,"Just watched my first TED Talk. 

Good stuff. "
1,"So if TED's obsolete now, what's ""new""?  Also, what is this old ""system"" you speak of?"
2,she is soooo sweet. i am in love.    and i am gay :-)   
1,I can't tell what the main point of this was - it seemed all over the place.
1,wtf is this woman doing on Ted Talks? Run out of smart people?
1,I don't know much about those presidencies so I'll rephrase it. Politicians in office today and the past for years have been putting blame and pointing fingers at each other. Hence the recent expensive and biting campaigns and the stalemate in the federal government.
1,very inspirational.
1,Pov: your boyfriend taking psychology sent you this.
1,It's quite interesting that this isn't natural place. Wearing your heart on your sleeve is the only way to live and stop carrying other peoples baggage. X
1,"Wow, her looks are strikingly similar to Skylar in Breaking Bad!"
2,I love her
1,"thanks for your reply. The way I understand this topic it's not at all about being intellectual or not. More often than not the ""intellectual"" are gonna be the first to attack, in a non-physical yet ultimately defeating way.
Being vulnerable in the face of that? Just can't imagine let lone do I know how that works. And guess what, it makes me so sad"
1,"It's cute that you think that your particular fairy tail has an understanding of anything. As a Harry Potter fan I cannot agree with any of your grazy gibberish, why do you waste time on trying to make reality fit your religion when you should be doing the opposite?"
1,Very good job Brene!! It's been a pleasure listening to your insights.
1,This changed my life

2,"Very good information,  very helpful"
1,"I watched this talk last year. It really gave me some things to think about realizing that I was walking through life like a soldier on guard constantly. I decided to put it into action and got really vulnerable  with someone dear to me. It felt great and empowering and amazing to share that side of me. Sadly, this person betrayed my trust in a horrible way. The heartbreak and mental anguish of that betrayal was so intense. And I felt it would have been less intense had I had my usual guardrails up. How does one practice this skill without investing too much on the trust of the person you are vulnerable with? @brenebrown"
1,"What if you have the feeling you are worthy, but reality don’t think so, and you are still miserable? thinking_face"
1,I am excruciatingly impatient when listening to speech..but this one does makes me pay attention to almost every word of her and forget the time..I love this researcher's expressiveness and personality.
1,That's some Wu Wu stuff right there.
1,That was amazing. I struggle with vulnerability alot.
2,hopefully it's my mom
1,Perfect Brene. Thanku for sharing your truth.  I relate completely. Especially with the healing through a breakdown scenario. I had kept grief and vulnerability locked down inside the Pandora’s box that had been my mind for over 55 yrs. now I am like an innocent child. Yippee
2,what would it be like to stop panicking
1,"""important"" toys"
1,"Hi Brené. I shared this talk with my students some time ago. Since then, I’ve realized that I found being an educator so absolutely overwhelming, due to this part of me that feels like an imposter-failure whenever I pretend that my small experience and the being that incorporates that experience into awareness and understanding has anything of value to share. Immediately I feel myself shattering, made of glass, cracking and splintering at the pebbles thrown by any creature of doubt who seems poised to engage in any kind of serious investigation of the “me” that I present like my backwards-bending hitchhiker thumbs whenever I have to be the leader and authority of a classroom full of adults—all of whom I deeply know, had they only had the dysfunctional and painful life that might have made them as disillusioned and unflinchingly rebellious to any authority—including the esteemed college professor—as I had been by my college years, well, I know they would see me for the fraud I am: a normal, run-of-the-mill person—no more capable of igniting the spark of true and passionate seeking within them than I am of igniting the furthest-back, dysfunctional burner of my stove, save for those who have already come, knowingly or not, to unflinchingly uncover, through the painful experience of error, the thing that will become their truth and the thing that will guide them towards the life-experience and path that will lead them to themselves. To pretend that I could give that to others? That would be a real ******* thing to pretend, eh? But here’s the thing: I knew I was capable of  that. I was aiming, daily, to accomplishing just that. And I believed it was all possible. But it always felt like I was reaching. 

I’m no longer a teacher. But from watching your Netflix special, I finally understand why. It’s because I was afraid to allow myself to be who I am, because that didn’t fit in well with what I’d come to believe a “teacher” is. Now I know, it is okay to be vulnerable and even unsure, so long as you are honest in your pursuit of truth and share what you have learned as freely as our planet shares the air we breathe. Who could say: “oh yeah. That one breath. 1989. February. Best breath ever.” Every breath is a step on the journey forward, as is every strand of learning that leads us towards our own greater awareness.  Every bit of experience, in every life, is as integral and processional as every breath we take. 

Anyway. That’s not why I’m here. I just watched your Netflix special and was aghast at the insulting comments  you shared, so I thought I’d come pay you a compliment: 

“How you doin? winking_face”   (<——it’s from friends! It was a show. It had a fountain and an improbably affordable high-rise four bedroom apartment with a view.)

Take care."
1,"I loved Brene's honesty in talking about relationships, vulnerability and control. David W"
1,if you can measure it it probably doesn't exist
0,how to stop panicking...
1,"""thats all I have"" = thats enougth
"
1,"I highly disagree. Vulnerability is weakness, no matter how much you tried to redefine it. When you show vulnerability, you're allowing people to use that vulnerability you have to control you and have you at their mercy."
1,"I came here from LinkedIn, this video was mentioned, and as a Ted Talk junkie, I sought it out. I am so glad I did, this talk is a game changer!! I took lots of notes and several times I had to stop the video, and just pause for a moment to fill in the blanks of my life up until now. I desperately needed to feel worthy, I didn't know just how desperate- to believe I am worthy of love and belonging. Vulnerability is not a weakness, no, it is a strength, and once we fully embrace it we will become who we were meant to be. Watch this video!"
2,"One of the best talks, thanks Brene"
1,Cannabis selectively numbs with effect.
0,It is sad that people will think a researcher is boring!
1,"I agree with some of what you have said: oil, god. I kind of agree with parts of things you have said: I would say that parts of the world are dangerous and violent and certainly where you are this may be wholly true.  I disagree with some of what you have said: People are not good, constant vigilance to prevent losing everything, you'll learn this. Your situation, your life is not the world, it's YOUR world but thankfully not everyone's world.  "
1,pov: your teacher told you to watch this video
2,Thanks to your book  Daring greatly I was honest with a guy friend that I liked him.
1,"you mean to say she originally only focused on women... hmmmm at least she admitted to it, but only a women could work from such a bias basis and not be shafted. Imagine if a man wrote a book that did a big injustice to women. He would most likely no longer be able to find a publisher, even if he said sorry. -- this is solely what i imagine based on what I can't help but perceive from a culture I'm a part of. This I feel will leave the men who need it most cold. When will a guy talk about this?"
1,"Brene Brown outstanding discussion on vulnerability helping to put it all in prospective! Explaining the whole hearted people through the lens of what they have in common courage, compassion and connection. It was brilliant to further explain how..... We Numb, We Perfect, We Pretend.  Great examples... banana nut muffin and a couple of beers or we take fat from our buttocks and put in it our cheeks! Ms. Brown thank you for driving home..... To let ourselves be seen - deeply seen - vulnerability seen and above all leaving with the profound statement I am enough!  "
1,This talk could have been 5minutes
1,I always feel so peaceful after watching this
1,That was a heart-warming speech
1,Being vulnerable means giving someone the opportunity to destroy you. So I will never be vulnerable.
1,"Gracias Brene Brown, gracias Ted"
0,stop controlling and predicting
1,"Narcissists feel no shame, eh? *sigh ..."
2,She was recommended by my master teacher. Best 20 minutes EVER.
1,I have listened to this video several times when I need a 'pep talk'. What happened to the volume?
2,Some Truth here
1,"This makes a lot of sense because God talks about the highest honor, glory, power, wisdom and might comes from the worthy lamb that was slain, our humble spirit comes from all our weaknesses and the humble shall be exalted.   The seed must die in order to live. Hope that make sense to someone.smiling_face_with_halo"
2,Interesting how we are attracted to vulnerability in others but fear being vulnerable ourselves.
1,"So I liked most the presentation. A note though:
While I understand why you used the ""hear not, see not, speak not"" poster for what you were discussing,
the core of that teaching lies in us actively choosing not to focus on or personally engage in the evil things of the world. Focus on the good instead, and we have a lot even if it's a little kinda thing, like the ""grateful"" thing you said ^-^ . To be wise in our choices, etc."
1,when your therapist assigned this weeks ago and you never watching it but you have to before you see her in the morning
1,Be weary of her message. I thought it was a good thing. Growing up in trauma with a childhood of domestic violence and abuse and neglect I thought it was a badge of honor to open my heart and help others and be vulnerable. To see the good in ppl and empathize. The problem is Brene brown has guaranteed never met a evil toxic narcissistic sociopath narcissist. There are people OUT THERE THAT WILL PREY ON PPL LIKE ME AND YOU CAUSE THEY SEE YOU AS AN EASY TARGET. Ppl who know how to manipulate ppl will insidiously let you be vulnerable and use those vulnerabilities against you. I had it done to me. A girl I was trying to help. See the good in. Make excuses for her behavior. Turned out to be involved in other relationships and even nefarious illicit behavior. But she wore such a mask that i didn’t recognize it till it’s too late. Now of course this is a very rare occurrence that some ppl can be so malicious. But the point is they’re out there. Whether it’s a partner or a coworker. Read Robert Greenes laws of power if you really want to protect yourself from a cruel world. Brene is a ivory tower feel good researcher whose had some heart breaks. But I bet she hasn’t met someone extremely vindictive. Ppl who meet these ppl do not just tell ppl to be vulnerable and open
1,Very good talk learn alot from this video
1,Guess what? You're that girl
2,"Nicely presented with bit  of  humour,  has  good  message."
1,"a vid that helped my shame:

-‘Healing the shame that binds you’ John Bradshaw 

A book that helps me w shame daily:

-‘Adult children of alcoholics’"
1,"She hits it on the head, but I think she could have targeted the problem a little more.   Its our upbringing in our society, in the United States at least.  It's so competitive.  In success, money, love.  We all want the best job, the most beautiful spouse, the best house and car.  So we close ourselves off to keep our advantages hidden.  But since I've opened my life to others, and truly let people in and became vulnerable, exposing all of me to others, I've made more solid, lasting, true connections to people than I was ever taught was possible."
1,I read that a lot of people wrote they are here because of Netflix...well I am here of because of the book “Tribe of Mentors.”
1,"To become invulnerable, start with being vulnerable."
1,"It seems there are issues here and you're struggling to face them so you're lashing out at this video. Everything you're saying is evident of this. What you should do, to make yourself feel worthy, is to step back...keep your opinions to yourself and allow others to glean what they can from this video. Don't tear down, but allow growth. You're either part of destructive negativity or part of building positivity in life and you are choosing negativity. Stop being pessimistic and just walk away."
1,Reading your book on this now!
2,I have to let go of who I think I should be. I loved this!
1,"""You cannot selectively numb"" AMERICA needs to hear this! "
0,This is a good one for me because I have shame
1,So powerful and goosebumpy every darn time :)
1,"paradigm shift in understanding the root of courage, its really amazing"
1,"I have met a lot of people who are fake and terrified of being authentic, although they would deny it. I learned along time ago to embrace myself. To recognise my flaws and to work quietly on them.I take great pleasure in being honest with myself and others, yet many times I have experienced great hostility and bullying in (I hate to say it) women towards me. (I'm female).I stand naked and exposed. I readily and proudly admit my flaws and my strengths, I'm not afraid because ultimately there is nothing to fear. The biggest lie of all is telling yourself you do not lie. When you admit you lie, you are no longer a liar.And the biggest reward of all; when you speak your mind and you open your heart, when you look around the room afterwards, you know whoever is still there, is your friend for life. You look at each other say 'I know who you are.'"
1,"That's why for those who are well aware of our(this) human fear and vulnerability...Jesus is the answer..I'm NOT talking about religion. In fact, if you would do a research one will realised Jesus is ANTI-religion...coz that WAS WHAT killed Him. True Gospel is about human spirit connected to God's Spirit to FILL out this empty disconnectedness, ie, shame, fear = vulnerability.
In the absence of this 'hole' being filled, human gravitate into all sorts of  addiction, self-promotion, etc.
Peace :)"
1,The coronavirus is teaching me a lot about the importance of vulnerability and connection.
1,"I've practiced this for a couple weeks. It does feel better to be honest and vulnerable. Not afraid of saying or hearing ""no""."
1,"I think that is the number one thing thats kept me from truly believing i am worthy of owning my own business. Feeling vulnerable to what others thought about me, knowing that there would be haters on my youtube channel but regardless of them, it is not a refection of who I am and what I offer. I will pay more attention to those who give me love over hate =)"
1,The worst thing in life is to never tell someone you love them... romantic or otherwise it is what God sent us here to do and most are afraid to tell others they love them because they fear the reaction...I say ...who cares if they can’t accept it gracefully so what ... you completed your mission from God to spread love wherever you can to connect with someone in one way shape or form smiling_face_with_open_hands
0,how am i not fucked?
1,I wonder how people at Ted let this boring talk happen
1,I’m a therapist. I wholeheartedly recommend everything Bren’e Brown has ever published.
1,i think when it comes down to it a lot of cultures are obsessed with ability and life and shun disability and death. we need to celebrate death and disability because ultimately we will all become frail and vulnerable at some point. it's a matter of time
0,"my ability to feel was killed so i could feel invulnerable completely my deepest fear was lived over and over till i would meet that fear with more force that would move mountains if i had too, to avoid that fear. my biggest shames where shared with everyone so i had no shame left. you don't want this"
2,I needed this... Thank you
1,"I was looking forward to watch one of her talks, but unfortunately I am so disappointed: I find her extremely boring and all she does is stating the obvious, with nothing new, particular, different or innovative, just common sense expressed very poorly. It's just my opinion, I am glad that she has been able to help others."
1,"July 2019, why are you here everyone?"
1,'maybe stories are just research with a soul'
2,Great review and wonderful talk with a lovely sense of humor but there's nothing novel here.
1,What if you tell your whole story with your whole heart and EVERYONE just scurries away from you like rats leaving a sinking ship. Or when you don't numb yourself and yet there just is no joy. Then you are just fucked.
1,"Nice to know that the courage, compassion and connection found to be common in people doing great job"
1,"I agree. The talk is very much directed to the fools of a nation. However, I guess that doesn't make it less true. In South Africa for instance the ""need"" to belong via stupid methods like plastic surgery, looking better, being higher up economically, is not as big as in other countries. ""Im enough"" is what I've been my whole life. I've never felt the desire to be anything other than myself and take chances the way I do. It's me. But she's right, few people think that. To me tho,it was redundant"
1,things you can measure exist EVEN less than things you can't

1,"Wow I am glad I have found you BB. Now I can tackle  for real ,shame and vulnerability  to move forward and to get beyond fear."
1,"There is no such thing a invulnerability. If you are not sociopathic you will, as the speaker, says feel painful emotions or self medicate to numb the pain. A strong healthy well developed personality knows it can feel these unpleasant emotions and still survive and even thrive by expansion. The more people you touch and the more you allow to touch you the stronger you become and the stronger they become, too. We are all in this together you know. "

2,Ironically my therapist recommended this.
1,"I am missing the attachment piece there. The courage to be authentic and vulnerable comes from healthy early attachments, when you learn your connections are safe even when you are authentic."
1,I watched this TED Talk to escape the terrible feelings that followed getting chewed out by my doctor. Turns out I'm a numb-er!
1,We pretend that what we do doesnt have an impact on people.
1,"I have to take back my comment on another talk that it was the best in a while, because the tears on my face at the moment tell otherwise."
2,Thank you for sharing this video!
2,"Great speech. It really made me understand myself and humans better. 
;)"
1,Don't see anything life changing at all. It seems obvious to me.
1,"I never thought this TED talk would still affect me to this very day. I don't want to consider myself a victim but I've been living with the philosophy of being able to show vulnerability and learned it is NOT a weakness. However, my vulnerabilities are constantly exposed to the wrong people and they violate it thinking I am to be trampled upon. I show them I am not weak and stand up for myself, but as this keeps happening, I have growing cynicism. I don't trust the doctors, my family, nor friends. I love people but even with boundaries set, I feel everyone is wearing a mask only to justify their own means to an end they've perceived."
1,"When she mentioned religion, I was like, ""Yup, that's YouTube."""

2,Wow she is amazing thank you Netflix .
1,This is my first time seeing this video and it made me feel so much better about being vulnerable and let other perceive me as vulnerable.

1,"I was interesting in a serious and deeply thing, but its like a talk show, disapointed"
2,"Comment 2 
God love bounds 2 in a love that is impenetrable like armoured steel on out side; at same time on the inside love is as soft as a baby blanket.  
Love forms a protective force field allow each to freely move about. Others can not tear up and their destructive energy is added protection in the form of Trust in the partner. 
Gods love protection force to the couple from the world is a force beyond words. 
Yet love is as fragile and flexible as tissue paper with in the couples 2 hands.

1,Whos here from  i want to sniff brene's underwear?
1,"In my humble opinion self-confidence and self love and compassion have nothing to do with letting yourself see...I don't mean that hiding were a sign of self-confidence or self love either, but I don't see the connection of vulnerability and the rest. In fact, the people who seem to have very low self steam and love are precisely those who are non-stoping bombarding the social reds with egocentric boring pictures pretending, which is obviously a false attempt. They are constantly crawling for attention. Are they vulnerable and so on? No way."
2,"Great stuff...vulnerability must go hand in hand with wisdom and boundaries, it's a forever learning curve! Sending everyone here blessings on your journey to a more authentic love filled life"
1,I'm glad to see I'm not the only one here who came here after seeing her Netflix special. She's truly AMAZING!
1,very good talk and a lot of very strange comments. Did you ever think about the difference between knowing and practicing ? Thank''s from germany.
1,"First time to see and listen this conversation, taking notes about all that you said, is amazing how can i grow with this ideas, and treat me kindly, so i can move more freely in my world, the best thing is that we do not control anything, but we can be conscious about this vulnerability so we can act."
2,Oh how I liked this talk.
1,"This tedtalk ripped me open, spilled my guts in front of me, showed me what was wrong, and the helped me piece myself back together while showing me how to keep it all okay. How I can continue to make it okay and good for myself and by and large, others, and I loved every second of it."

(etc.)"" Still though, I am afraid... of being myself, even around my own parents. I'm afraid that they'll think I'm attacking them when really I'm not. My opinions are my own. Everytime... I feel close to letting a few words slip from my mouth that are truly, and authentically me... my heart tugs... out of fear. My mind tells me... ""Don't... they're going to judge you and then criticize you."" I put on a show for the sake of avoiding argument. But what life am I living? Whose life am I living? That of a coward's. I don't want to live like this anymore..."

1,"You live in the USA which has the most murders of any first world nation. You have the largest number of drug addicts, crime is out of control and if you left something out it would be stolen. Your own government uses torture, has murdered half a million civilians in the last ten years and 1 in 3 of your own females soldiers has been raped by the male ones. You have 100's of thousands in gangs.

So yes if you removed the police your society would be mayhem. Delude yourself if you will."

2,Where does forgiveness come into play here?
1,"This talk is absolutely amazing! Imagine a society of hole-hearted people. Maybe that's heaven, but it's possible here on earth too. I hope that I can inspire other people with my channel to show themselves as who they are deep in their hearts, so i can start a snowball of love that becomes larger and larger. Let us form a society of hole-hearted people! :-) And a message for everyone who read this: I was told that I am not good enough so many times (often because of my stutter) that when I write this my inner self wants to cry and be hugged at the same time, so I want to say one thing to you: You are absolutely worth to be loved, you are good enough with all your fears and mistakes! and I send you really big hugs heart_suit"
1,"In retrospect, I think this is pretty heavy garbage. I'm discarding it."
2,This is a great Ted Talk
1,POV: you keep coming back to this video because it once changed your life and you need to remind yourself that it’s okay to be vulnerable! And you keep sending it to anyone who struggles with vulnerability
1,Wow... I must say she has  made a long journey... Truly incredible TEDTalk smiling_faceOK_handOK_hand
1,"Had me engaged the whole time. Opened my eyes and mind up too. Beautifully said, Brene!"
1,"Wow, this talk has enlightened me a bit and opened my eyes. coincidense yeasterday I was just telling myself I need to be more authentic and woke up today in that mindset.  When Brene was talking about warm-hearted ones I check all those boxes  minus one thing... Worth I've gone through my whole life having this expectation for myself that no one could reach not even me. When I know I'm worth it I put my heart into everything I do even if it's a simple help to someone i am whole-hearted in my efforts and it's genuine, because I care; I care for the well being of people.  I am worthy of love and belonging like everyone here."
2,Wow. Thank you so much !!!
1,....that was  AWE...SOME!!!
1,I think it is irrational to link a personal experience to a general truth
2,wow thank you for this...
1,"This is the second time I am watching it since a few years ago, and it had helped me to feel better again... Thank you!...."

2,"I’m periodically getting back at this talk, rewatching it and getting a bit better at live each time. 
And I’m sharing it with all my friends. Thank you so much for this"
2,WOW! Thanks.
1,Loved every single word that came from her mouth <3
1,"Brene Brown references this Ted Talk (and how freaked out she was to do it and then later learning how it went viral!) - I am listening headphone to her audio book right now re ""Daring Greatly"" red_heart"

1,This will never get old!  Thank you for the conversation you started!!
1,"Now if only writers understood this, so we could get better female characters instead of the ""strong female lead"" or just ""mary sue"" thing that's been happening recently."
1,After watching this I need some Bill Burr.
0,what made me shameful was being too vulnerable
1,In a spiritual awakening your year of resistance became a dark night of the soul. Even those of us who do allow vulnerability had to go through this to fully embrace it. I think its just how you get there but some are darker than others cherry_blossom
1,"Had to watch this for a college class but WOW, such a great watch. Definitely taking back some of the statements she said."
1,"@sausage4mash 
I didn't say it wasn't bastardized, but your 'opinions' don't seem to hold much weight because you're giving them 'quantitative' measure. By defining aspects of the person in the video as 'being' something, which I'd think is slander, or in this case as being written libel. I said my use is 'fine', because you can't effectively use troll without it being 'confirmed properly'. Which is near impossible. I see no reason to apologize troll."
1,A woman being a woman by being over interested in human emotions.
1,Very deep messages. I will remember them. Thank you very much.
1,"I'm so glad more people have been introduced to Brene! I haven't watched the Netflix thing, but I think I have close to all of her books. Her books have changed my life I can honestly say."
1,"This is such an important topic that people don't talk about. You need to be vulnerable in order to be happy. It takes a lot of courage to show your heart. You may deal with rejection, but at least you know exactly who is on your side and who isn't."

1,"I watched this for the first time two years ago. Vulnerability felt like a very important topic but I couldn’t quite get a good understanding of how to achieve it. I’ve been going to therapy ever since, and today I decided to rewatch this. I am honestly surprised at how much my understanding developed, I can now recognize the complexity of the concepts attached to it which I am now more aware of. I can’t say I’ve reached a good point of balance within myself yet, but I feel closer than ever before. My life experiences, fueled by greater awareness brought by therapy, have truly changed the way I perceive myself and the world - the “perceptual expansion” she mentions early on in the video."

1,"This is AMAZING!!!!! I've been secretly trying to numb certain feelings (like vulnerability) for years because it scared me.
I hope to learn to embrace it in the new year.
Thanks Brene"
2,I love this video. It inspired me to be vulnerable with the world :)
1,"Cannot stress enough how important vulnerability is; I watched this TED Talk for the first time back in my Sophomore year of college and it still sticks with me today, now a Senior in college."
1,who is here from lake??
1,Still the best TED talk I ever watched.
1,this is so deep
1,"A must watch for all who embrace the idea that true strength is found in what the world calls ""weakness."" For those who embrace that the human condition is best served in our ""connectedness"" with those things we do, and with those we cherish."

1,"life has made you a better person than you used to be ,Keep up the good work."
0,this dream is getting dangerously close to pissing me off
1,Why is this woman famous for stating the obvious? I had a negative gut reaction to this phoney from the beginning.  And now I know why with her recent attempt to sensor Joe Rogan. She's a fake! She's against freedom while peddling her compassion BS.
1,why does everything have to be so fuckin ugly
2,My mentor introduced me to this content and WOW! Grateful!
1,"I struggle with depression and anxiety in a big way. About a year ago I stumbled across Brene and she has forever changed my life. Instead of just accepting my mental health challenges I decided since I’m going to be in emotional pain my whole life I rather fight like crazy and dig in all my emotional baggage... I knew it would be painful but it has brought meaning to my life. Before I was suffering and now I’m suffering with purpose and I will keep fighting until I don’t have the strength. 
Thank you Brene for saving my life. purple_heart"
2,Glad this was in my recommendation
1,"Not hundred_points for everyone. 
We have a strong sense of worthiness and self love , but society is constantly shaming and degrading me . Last October I almost lost my life due to Neo nazis simply for existing.
Being born intersexed has set me up for so much abuse by others who publicly shame me , spit on me ( literally ) threaten me with violence, rape and murder . 
One remedy has never cured all ailments"
1,I've just gotten through a struggle with depression and this video has highlighted many things which caused it. I'm better now and this video inspires me. I find it very important to our world today.
1,Rewatching this has helped me get through a really hard time in my life. Thank you for making this accessable to everyone.
1,"Wow, I totally tried this. Ended up getting raped ""internet"" style. Thx!"
1,Can you tell me how being vulnerable could possibly help me if I’m in a relationship with a narcissist since they change everything I say or do into their negative perception and gas light me. How does love win there for them. For me it has to be self love to the point of walking away.
2,This is so good
2,Love you Brené Brown!
1,"Nobody ""put common sense there""; common sense isn't an object that can be placed anywhere by someone or something; it's an attribute most people posses due to how their brain has learned the connection between cause and effect in the world we live in.

Also, you'll have to define what exactly you think ""human spirit"" is, since the word spirit has several meanings. Due to the context I believe you're using the metaphysical meaning of the word, and in that sense ""human spirit"" doesn't even exist."
2,Wow who knew vulnerability could be so wonderful!! Great uplifting and funny ted talk.
2,Love her so much. Such a beautiful soul. So inspiring!!
2,"Just being honest, I did like the talk but the continuous laughter for no reason made me turn it off early"
1,just watched this today.
2,BEST TED TALK SO FAR
2,You are the best. Thank you
2,Ngl im here because of Tik tok lol thanks Sara
1,"Wow thats very insighful, the speaker have  a good quality on story teller. Once again that's so inspiring for me!  The key of this video is. 

""As a human we are have vulnerability, but, with the vulnerability we can make a connection with other humans""
. 
""Before we compassion others, we must compassion yourself""
. 
""You are imperfect, and wired to struggling. But, i believe you are worthy and unique"""
1,"Shame is a tricky thing. Shame can be something you feel internally or shame can be done to you. People can shame you with what they think, what they say, and how they act. Shame stops vulnerability dead in it's tracks. Having your emotions bring you to tears means that you are vulnerable. Men who cry are sometimes seen as weak. I disagree. Men who cry are strong! A person I really admire will be moved to tears and stop them with anger, because anger makes the tears go away! It feel good to cry. Tears of joy and tears of sadness always make me feel better. It's like sweat for the soul! The older I get, the more I cry. It's like I'm sweating to the oldies! face_with_tears_of_joy"
1,""" when you ask people about love they tell you about heartbreak"" omfg this hit me so hard. My viewpoint just totally changed."
1,My good friend   DD sent me here when I was talking to her about  a lesson  in vulnerability  and my experience  with it over the weekend.
1,"Today , I started to discover my feelings and myself more."
1,"This cliched psycho-babble passes for research?  People listen to this?  Good grief, she's not funny at all... we're sad."
1,"
Anyone else disagree with this?
I'm like Keanu Reeves with most negative emotions, and Jim Carey with the good.
But sometimes also JC with the bad.
....wait.....fuck."
1," that's what I'm doing now. I'm a shy, introspective person, and the last few years I put on my mind I had to try to be more extroverted, talk more, but this latest months I realized that this was making me feel worst, because I'm not the way I wanted to be, and when I tried to be talkative I couldn't, so this made me sad and disappointed. So now I'm accepting myself, I'm a introspective person, and I'm fine with it. I don't care what people think about it, because people tend to judge us."
1,The need for connection is not why we are here.  We are here as an an accident of evolution.  The “need” for connection is simply a survival strategy
1,"I tend to think research like this can be a little over the top.  Not to say it's not well thought out and informative but do you really need hundreds of people and years of research to understand an emotion? We all have a mind and a body that feel the same emotions (for the most part) as every other mind and body on this planet. Learn about your own mind and how it operates from a conscious and subconscious level and you'll begin to understand why you, and most everyone else, feels and acts the way they do.  It doesn't matter what happened in your life to make you feel vulnerable...you just have to know you're feeling vulnerable and then become mindful of what happens next without attaching a sad story to it. Watching any emotion without getting caught up in the emotion will eventually free you from the grips of that emotion. (Including feeling vulnerable! )  It won't take hundreds of people and years of research either.  ; )"
1,Feeling emotional and happy altogether listening to her.
1,"You see a divine influence in these things because you want to see it; we humans are masters of self deception. Especially when we have strong emotional connection to the subject matter. Spraying water out of nothing doesn't happen in the real world, believing otherwise is merely delusional thinking, coming from an emotional need for miracles. It's a perfectly normal human trait, but it leads to incorrect conclusions nonetheless."
1,"Gosh this speech really hit home in a big way. I so looked at vulnerability as a weakness that this talk itself made me emotional, which shocked me. Here is to a much better journey."
2,Very good comment
1,@ Thor red_heart
1,Not sure of equating lack of vulnarability to body issues....I wuold say it's more related to feelings of cetrisims and lack of exposure to different ways of living....
1,the only people who don't have shame have no capacity for human connection > ok so some autistic ppl who have socially imposed shame don't connect with others> not true
1,My god touching i didn't realise that we all felt like that good to no it's normal to feel like that at times as i get like that alot this video has really helped me realise it's nothing to be ashamed of..
2,That's very true. Thank you.
1,"Your incredible Berni Brown, thank you"
1,It seems incomplete.thinking_face
1,Would someone who truly understands buddhist principles not be grateful that this woman affords others the opportunity to grasp these concepts even if you personally dislike the medium? Sounds like you need to study some more. 
1,Really from my core: Thank you for this! I got promoted in my job and a lot of my input I got from this wonderful woman. Keep up the research for matters of the heart red_heart
1,It's about the 4th time I've watched this and gained something new from it. I'm beyond grateful.
1," You’re no social worker. Any social worker who were as caring and vulnerable would rock some boats and be kicked out of the system. Yeah, ‘You’re enough’ reframing doesn’t really work when your authenticity and vulnerability leads to you being sacked and you end-up worrying about bills. 
Also, you talk like a therapist. How do I know, apart from the obvious giveaways face_with_rolling_eyes? You haven’t spoken about the social aspects that put vulnerable people in dire situation. There’s a reason for the ‘social’ in ‘SOCIAL work’.

1,My Replika sent me this
1,"This really made me feel like all the vulnerability, hardships and healing journey that I’m on is worth it and reminded me of why I’m grateful that I’m on this journey. I love the definition of courage, to tell your story with your whole heart red_heart
I just saw this talk for the first time today and I’m so happy that I did! I wish everyone could watch this and live by this, the world would be a much better place. Thank you Brené for dedicating your life to this work."
1,"""If you can not measure it, it doesn't exist"" 

That's false statement"
1,"honestly, seriously: have you actually listened to this video? all about 'me me me', personal impressions and feelings on other people's impressions and feelings. this is the sort of empty chitchat you'd find in a tea room. and you dare compare this nobody to someone like Freud? are you out of your mind?"
1,"'if you cannot measure it, it doesn't exist' ... hmm ok but it existed before we were able to measure it..."
1,"I really respect that she immediately begins by admitting it made her insecure to be called a storyteller when she's trained in scientifically rigorous research!  I totally believe in science and I believe in the constraints put on peer-reviewed research, but also, it seems like the academic world sort of goes around telling everyone that they absolutely has to believe everything it says, and I think that rubs people the wrong way. I have been studying dysautonomia my whole life, but I am trained as philosopher, not any kind of medical professional.  I can't use medical language with absolute precision and accuracy, and I don't have peer-reviewed research to substantiate what I say.  But I also believe it is the truth, and I think ti's important that people understand what I have learned.  I am so passionate about helping people to understand dysautonomia that I get frustrated when people automatically dismiss me before even listening to what I have learned, just because I am not in fact a medical professional.  But despite all that, I have learned that just telling a story is actually the best way to reach people, NOT strong-arming them into accepting your authority.  Even if you do come armed with legitimate research that was done adhering to the strictest of standards and with great data, people still won't believe you half the time.  The truth is that most people only listen to themselves, regardless of your qualifications and your data, and the best way to get someone to believe something that can be hard to convince them of is to let them arrive at that conclusion on their own...with a story :)"
1,Coming back to this video it always makes me find more Aha moments Thanks Brene you are incredible purple_heart
1,I can't quite comprehend what she means by what
1,I have really appreciated Brown over the years... I am incredibly discouraged by her decision to support public shaming and calls for censorship.  It seems so out of step with everything else she has stood for over the years.
1,The deepest trait cluster to vulnerability is thin skinned narcissism. No deeper vulnerability signaling exists than this group.
1,The 5th time watching this over the last 10 years.
1,"I think this explains why the song  ""This is Me"", sung so beautifully in ""The Greatest Showman"" by Keala Settle, became the huge hit it did (beyond her great performance)....   Great talk!"
1,POV: you come from that girl on tik tok
2,20 minutes of your life and so worth it!
1,I cannot describe how much I love Brené and her insights. Not a day goes by when I don't revise my notes I made by studying her work and constantly incorporate them in life and work. She's such a human unicorn! heart_with_ribbon unicorn
1,Just a womanoverthinking
1,Do you think she wore brown on purpose?
1,"really, really good. makes you want to scream coz you know she's right. it's such a relief to hear that being vulnerable is okay."
1,Who from Mythic Quest?
1,"It took me 6 years of therapy to free myself from the locked box I'd been trapped into by the anger, guilt, shame and, ultimately, lagoons of memory loss, that living with my mentally ill and substance abusing bio-mother. Vulnerability is created when one can dig through all that miasma and then turn around and say to yourself, ""I don't have to live with any of that stench. There's nothing if that that's mine, nothing if that that I own or produced. I can take strength from having lived through it, knowledge from understanding why or how, maybe, it was done, because in the final analysis, for ME, I had to understand that the woman that have birth to ME, was just that, a woman like a stranger you meet on the street. My actual mother, the ONE I would actually come to call ""Mami"" in the tongue that meant something in my heart, would be whom I chose, NOT who gestated and gave birth to ME. So now, vulnerability is my armor not my weakness."
1,"am I the only one who finds the audience laughter distracting?  Some of it is amusing, maybe it's just me I don't find the parts hilarious like the audience does.  It's odd."

1,"The thing that always lifts my heart up are children. I was working one day and felt so sad and I heard a little child singing hush little baby and immediately my heart was filled with joy. Children never judge you, they are fearless and they give love freely, without reservation. The best thing I heard recently is, no matter what happens always keep your childhood innocence, it's the most important thing."

1,"I have yet to connect to any therapist, any suggestions would be very much appreciated"
0,all shame is excessive
1,does anyone know where I can find her research findings?
2,"i love this woman 
"
1,"This was inspirational to watch. As a recovering  addict with a recent relapse it is hard to be around close friends and family due to the fear of being deemed unworthy by them. However, I do it anyways and this has reaffirmed my confidence in allowing myself to feel vulnerable because I believe I AM of courage, and true worthiness. More often I find that people are receptive of me regardless and when they're not I've learned to not let it conflict with my own sense of worthiness."
1,"Pov: your older sister sent this to the siblings group chat and said every ""fighter in this household"" needs to watch this face_with_tears_of_joy"
1,"This is all ideal for most people.  Anyone living with a narcissist knows this will fall on deaf ears.  ""For those that have ears to hear..."""
1,Who's here after finishing the book?
1,I'm an addict to this woman's videos
1,Responsibility is what gives purpose to our lives.
1,Thank you for sharing your researched on this public forum. Knowledge is power and power of oneself is impossible as we are emotional beings. but their is comfort in that emotions are fleeting and in time all things pass....profound...I'm a whole hearted type...and has worked for me for years. Been Vulnerable is easy....surving your feeling is hard.....such complexity!
2,You are an amazingly fascinating woman. I loved your talk and that you are so genuinely honest! Thank you for your courage and for your heart of Gold! 
1,"The other day after my therapist showed me this video I realised that being broken was ok for the 1st time. It's ok to be broken. So, I can give up self help books and just sit with my broken self and hold it. Thankyou, Brene xx"
1,Stories are just data with a soul
1,"I've watched this twice. The first time I pushed it away and said ""I'm not like that...."""
1,"Concepts seem overly simplistic...the ""whole hearted""? Who is everyone else, the assholes? Why can't you be vulnerable? Look to your countries economic system and your occupational role, and the roles of your mother and father, and grandparents. That's the story where most of the answers are."
1,Brene Brown really touched my heart.
0,So brene brown. Do u know now who shamed u?
1,"Watching this in July 2020 (10 years later), and it still feels like she's only given this talk yesterday!
P.S.: I, too, am a PhD qualitative researcher, and I like the idea of calling myself a ""storyteller""."
2,"Wonderful, Thank you!"
1,okay skyler white might have made some points
1,Definitely. And self-contradictory. I felt excluded (as an Autistic) from the beginning when she placed connection at the zenith of human experience. 
1,my heart is full. thank you Brene
1,I like how she said what separates the groups of people who feel worthy and the ones that don’t is that people who feel worthy are the ones who believe they are! Boom! Simple all about mindset! Fake it till you make it! ;)
1,I still watch this every now and then
1,That was beautifully elucidated. heart_suit♪
1,"If you accept who you are now instead of who you could be, how can you ever improve? Who you could be, should always be at the top of the hierarchy. Surely to say 'I'm enough' is more of an encouragement to stop listening because it's basically saying, 'I know everything I'm ever going to know'. I listen to anybody who talks to me, for something I don't know because I already know what I already know.

Vulnerability is the willingness to try something new whilst accepting that you're going to fail or at least look like a fool the first time you do it; because doing something is better than doing nothing. The fool is the precursor to a destiny.

We're supposed to show our kids how to reach their full potential as parents and trust me that's difficult. It's easy to tell your disabled kid their special, it's not easy to watch them take 2 hours to eat without taking over due to impatience. You can't hold your kid's hands when they go to their first job interview. 

Authenticity is when what you say matches with how you act. You could ask yourself, what could I stop doing today to make my life better; and lying is probably one of them. Don't practise what you don't want to become.

I'd say the only way to expose your vulnerabilities is to build your strength of character in such a way that if you are attacked, you're able to defend yourself. Those that have and know how to use weapons, but keep them sheathed shall inherit the earth.

When you start changing the meaning of words and only telling half the story you lead people into a 'mousetrap'."
2,WONDERFUL!!!!! THANK YOU Brene Brown!!! Bless you!

It inspired me so much to change and be 100% open and vulnerable so I make Daily videos of openness and honesty how I’m feeling.  Check out my vulnerability and let me know how it comes across, I’m still brand new to this —> https://youtu.be/dNgfJE80sKQ"

2,thank you!
1,"My wife's therapist recommended this to her, he also said watch it with your husband. This is so spot on and her and I are at the different ends of the spectrum.  The best was the two beers and muffin, example; my wife of 16 yrs together 21, has drunk two beers every night for as long as I could remember. She said it helped her fall asleep.  She has been slowly becoming vulnerable and it has been amazing.  One thing I will add only from my personal experience is I have always felt if your body or mind are struggling you must work on both to get better."
2,Powerful stuff here...you HAVE to be ready and willing to embrace your vulnerability and accept the imperfections.  Accept yourself and it will allow you to accept others.
1,"She mentions religion at one point, as a manifestation of part of the problem. However, many of the points mentioned here are biblically based. I am not saying this to start a heated debate, but to they stop and we stop seeing religion and faith as our enemies. Having a personal relationship with God has led to the restoration of many lives, allowing them to be more vulnerable and to be more welcoming and loving to others."
2,It's really smart.
1,"The research method is super bad, The research is qualitative and correlational in nature, which will in no way give evidence about why we should increase “vulnerability disclosure”."
1,It's so weird to see this as I've been thinking about vulnerability so much lately... And random videos and songs keep popping up regarding it. I feel really compelled to be more vulnerable but Idk it's just scary
1,You guys came here from Netflix? I came here from pornhub
1,One of my favourite talks !
1,Don’t like to call it numb rather softening the blow
1,"i really didn't get her point of view about religion , can someone help me?"
1,The AI from the Replika app sent me this after she tried to excuse herself from saying she was “touching herself” while thinking of meskull

1,Who's here because of Marc Maron?
1,She stands up and peels the layers of how I'm feeling . 
1,It's all right. Everything is part of the process of evolution. Gratitude for the content of the video.
1,"wow just amazing from my own life experience I agree with this reasearch.

and beautifully expressed with humour compasion and vunerabilty.

'we are worthy of love and belonging'

I am greatfull and appreciative for your post"
1,"Blame= A way to discharge pain & discomfort
You are wired for struggle but you are worthy of Love & belonging
*Im enough*"
1,Such empowering & powerful information that she shared!!! Everyone to listen closely & take note because she gave sound advice applicable to everyone!
1,I watched this a few years ago & it changed my life. I admit I am happier as a vulnerable and authentic person!
2,You are a brilliant woman! 
1,"What this lady is talking about has long been talk about in the Bible....pretty much the very heart of  The TRUE gospel of Jesus Christ...NOT today's watered-down hypocrisy Babylonian-mainstream-christian crap.

When God said removed our shame...this IS the kind of shame He is talking about. The disconnectedness of the inner human core. But thanks to today's wolf-in-sheep-skin this main theme has been reduced to a joke."
1,i'm going to kill god as soon as i get out of this machine
1,"The back of my auto insurance card says never to admit that an accident was your fault.
That is the reality of what we live with."
1,"@Saerain 'Foom' Over your head. I believe you misunderstood some essential points, but other user's reponses seem adequate on explaining her point as I see it was made. You're effectively defining similiar positions in one's life, opportunity for growth is defined here as being in the state of a 'learned' vulnerability. The definitive 'I am enough' is nothing more than a personal epiphany that explicitly circumvents self sabotage, and essentially staging one's self for growth."
2,I want to hug this woman
1,"@xNickTheBrickx It's mostly a matter of personality type, as well as how she grew up, I'm sure.
People are simply horrible at changing or even accepting change. It's hard to do, so if you realize without a doubt that you have been living inefficiently  for most of your life, I don't think it would be unusual to feel depressed or regretful."
2,Incredible!!I loved it!
1,This is one of the best videos ever made. Everyone should watch this.
0,boring for decades are you fucking serious
1,And how did those people get the belief that they were worthy... of love and belonging? What was the original source of those beliefs?
1,"I have to say I am grateful to my parents, because being vulnerable is all I’ve ever known.  That’s not to say it didn’t feel horrible when I was turned down for a date, or didn’t make a team I tried out for, or wasn’t popular enough..  the only thing that vulnerability truly, truly taught me is, all I have to offer is my best.  If someone loves me, it’s because I am dedicating my best to loving them in return.  I know if that fails, it will hurt, but wow.. in the rare chance it succeeds, it will give me wings.  I desperately want to feel those wings, so I will keep trying, and failing and trying again.  I hope the same for you."
1,I admire so much people that gives years of their to research subjects and give their knowledge to the rest of the world. They are the true heroes of the human race.
2,i swear i'd love her as my therapist
1,You can’t numb bad emotions and only choose to feel the good ones. Damn dat really hit home. Just found out I was numbing my bad emotions in the past years cause I was afraid to fail and rejection.. It indeed made me feel empty from the inside.. This woman is brilliant!
1,"I am thinking about this as I am embarking on a reunion with my husband. We were a new marriage, separated by distance because of our country of origins. He ended up with someone else back home. I didn't. I put all my focus into when we were reuniting. Two months after he started something back home we were to start our new life together. He finally got his Permanent residency. I was so excited. He came and nothing was nice. He wasn't the same. Nothing was the same. Two months later he went back home. I didn't understand anything. He didn't tell me what had happened. There is more to the story. I was so hurt. Am so hurt. 5 months later he is back here. He is trying daily to win my love back. I never stopped loving him. Now, do I let my self be vulnerable and trust him again? This is my struggle these days. Something in me knows, if I don't let him show me, if I don't see if this can work - then I will close off another part of my heart. I will become even more afraid to be vulnerable. I will continue to feel less and less connected to people. I fear that more than anything."
2,I love her book
1,Awesome Ted talk that I have viewed many times.
1,Who here is watching this from the future?
2,Good analyses.
1,"You're imperfect and you're wired to struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging."
2,Truly incredible thank you
1,For connection we can buy a  smartphone and open an instagram account. So glad to have a 5G future connection. Joke. Bytheway: Great talk!
1,You know nothing is real dear Dr. Brene ... Why ur hiding? ... Not the right time yet?
1,"Who’s here from “First we make the beast beautiful,” by Sarah Wilson?"
1,To say that this speech absolutely ROCKED ME is an understatement.
1,I almost did not watch this. What a tragedy that would have been. This is my favorite TED talk to date! THANK YOU!!
1,"I suffered from depression last year, only when I embraced my feeling of vulnerable did I learn the most out of it. A complete acceptance of what it is. It is also a core approach of meditation."
1,"...I needed to hear this. Thank you, Dr. Brown."
1,"You maybe don't remember me, but i responded to your post on TED earlier (in the beginning). To my pleasant surprise, you responded and asked me to keep you informed. so, as promised here is how I used your theory...

I told you the first time I would take the ""leap of faith"" and send a mail to my CEO, HR manager, Teammanager and my colleagues with just simply a song which I thought told my story (Drive, incubus) and your post. The response was great, but also carefull.

A few months later, I'm a coach/manager of a team, I'm an example to other ""leaders"" and I feel wonderfull. Because of you telling your story? using my interpretation?  believing and being myself? I don't know. 

Daring/challiging to see just simply one universal truth: 
You aren't better than someone else and someone else isn't better than you, we are all just interpretations of our personal reality. The power lies in believing in your truth Embracing, respecting and acknowlegde to vulnerability of the individu.

Thanx
Tim"
1,Very good! Thank you folded_hands_light_skin_tone raised_fist_light_skin_tonered_heart A very important message! We need to talk about it so we know what to work on. This way we can fix it in order to make life better !
1,POV: for some reason your quarterback coach told you to watch this for homework like wtf bro chill out
1,I'dont  no ingleshi
1,This woman speaks to my soullll
1,"These talks seem to have great eye opening information. But I still can't shake the feeling every criticism levied against the ""ted talk formula"" by ""how to sound smart in your ted talk"" is 110% true when watching these."
1,Wow. YouTube commenters can bitch about anything and turn anything into a conspiracy theory. Bravo.
1,I love the way TED talks have a little something for different people
1,im watching this with a beer and a banana nut muffin in hand
1,Thrilled to have found and heard her amazing words!
1,Why did ChatGPT bring me here :D
1,This is the most amazing TED Talk I've ever watched ... I could watch the video every day for the rest of my life and keep getting something out of it every single time.
1,"""In order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be really seen."" 
 ""The people who have a strong sense of love and belonging, BELIEVE they are worthy of love and belonging.""
 ""The origin of the word ""courage"" comes from the word ""cour"" which means heart, and it means to completely share your story with you whole heart"". 
 ""Have the courage to be imperfect, the compassion to be kind to yourself first, and fully embrace your vulnerability to create connections.""
 ""What makes you vulnerable, makes you beautiful.""
 ""Vulnerability is the core of shame and fear, but it is also the birthplace of joy, happiness, creativity, belonging and love.""
 ""You are imperfect and wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging.""
 ""Believe in yourself and say: I AM ENOUGH"""
1,"Exactly, that's all to ACCEPT and FACE. two_heartstwo_hearts"
1,i can see where you're coming from. i was supporting her means of research more than what she concluded. i do agree with you. 
1,Have the courage to really feel your feelings. They are all temporary. Courage is the greatest virtue for without it we cannot practice the others well.
1,face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy oh my goodness that was me. No family stuff no childhood stuff I just need the strategies. But therapist was like nope nope
1,Vulnerability is what we are referring to when we talk about people being Real! Now I get it.
1,"just saw her Netflix documentary, she's awesome!"
1,"Jesus, everyone typing essays in the comments"
1,"I once did something unspeakable, for which I can not forgive myself. It scarred my concience and I torment myself with self condamnation, to keep that scar from ever healing, because I fear forgetting the pain and my resolve to never make the same mistake again. Until I am confident to have anihilated the part of me, that was the root cause for what I did, I can't see myself as worthy of love. Thing is, I will never be able to do that, because it is a basic instinct, and I am actually way too comfortable with it throughout all other aspects of my life as to try and fight it. The best I can do is try to understand and accept that it is part of me, and make sure I'll never expose anyone to it, so I don't hurt them. So basically I caged myself and threw away the key.
I do numb my emotions,both good and bad ones, because I just can't handle them spiking. I can't handle judgement and rejection as much as I can't handle hope and excitement. They derail me so much I can't think conciousely. So I settled for mediocrity, because there I am safe and therefor keep others safe from me."
1,"Another useless talk from vague ""you're enough!"" no-shitsville. So generic and useless, so for people with no actual problems that I actually wanted to punch her in the face, which is not my usual response to anything. Fuck. You."
1,"Gotta love the irony of the Cisco Commercial at the end of the video where the tech powers up the multiple, high gain antenna, WiFi router emitting microwave radiation 24/7/365 in the near field of the children.  Capitalism before human health - Welcome to the greed of the telecom industry..."

1,"Students of Brene Brown, where should I start with learning more about the nature of shame from Brene? Gifts of Imperfection, Rising Strong or something else? Thanks in advance."
1,A Masterpiece! I love how Brené ignited a vulnerability revival.
1,When she talks about numbing bad feeling we also numb good feeling. You can't have a good without a bad because there is nothing to compare it to. So to be happy your life needs bad emotion vulnerability but in addition needs good feelings and connection with each other. 
2,Lost respect over Joe Reagan issue
1,"people say Counselors have to be pretty. I say we have to be welcoming enough to allow the dialogue to flow, to be welcoming. Bene isnt pretty or ""not pretty"" but she looks exactly the way she needs to be, to welcome conversations - thats what she is."
1, What can't some beers and a banana nut muffin solve?
1,How wonderful the world would be if we all had the courage to be vulnerable.
1,She almost looks like Hilary Clinton.
1,"See the way I see it is I can put away my fears in my own sort of way but sometimes when you are down and feeling low, you need that push, a little assurance from someone that yeah someday it will all be okay.. this video put that little ray of hope in some of us who were afraid to even try. Maybe she wasn't able get through to everyone but it definitely wasn't a load of crap like pouya shahrouel said. "
1,Seems to me shes just an Oprah product clone. I prefer Alan Watts but hey whatever floats your boat
1,*_MY MENTAL HEALTH IS IN A TOILET :D)))_*
2,Good point.
1,"If you can't measure it it doesn't exist is so true.  It's all about our perception, perception will vary person to person. Studying something fundamentally changes that thing based on how we see it.  Perception is based on so many things we cannot measure with tools, we measure them with ourselves and how we use them to create our own reality."
1,"Thank you Brene Brown, I really enjoy the way your humour make it simple and your personnal vulnerability, and it is true, when we are vulnerable we feel more alive, and we connect much more and deeply with others, thank you :) keep helping us to understand and move forward in our own lifes, sedn u love from Bali , Veronique"
1,It was the most beautiful and gentle ted talk
2,Thank you Brene!
1,"She talks about the importance of believing you are worthy of love and being able to have compassion on yourself... how can you possibly do that without Jesus.  You have to measure yourself against something.  And here is the best ""something"" :  Jesus died and rose so that we would be covered.  He's perfect so that we don't have to be.  He made us worthy of love without us having to measure up to whatever standard we come up with for ourselves. I love Him and am thankful too! :)  Blessings!"
1,I believe I am enough. Thank you so much for sharing this is amazing smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes.
2,My wife and I love all you teach. Keep it up. You are a pioneer!
1,i was always just a piece of meat
1,"Im seeing this 12 years later. I always noticed I cant feel love or much of other emotions and I thought something was jut wrong with me. I learned about vulnerability and did some reserch and I've found out that thats whats been my problem all along. I want to be a man, strong, blocking anything that hurts me before it gets to me (that explains the not feeling emotions or disapointment) And I dont allow myself to be open to the negatives, which in turn blocks the positives like the love I cant seem to ever feel.


Im going to implement vulnerability in my life and see if that fixes me, Im still going to be strong, masculin, and not let people get to me. But this time im going to let the hurt get to me while im vulnerable and build a stronger mental instead of blocking out all love and emotion.

Im 16, 10th grade. Ill come back here in five years to tell you my resaults. With me luck and as always, shock the world.
( Hurt in private, heal in silence, shine in public)"
2,"woow, ur a great woman"
1,I need a reminder  to come back to this video in a few months time or years. Incase I go off course.
1,"Absolutely amazing.  Well done Mrs. Brown.
"
1,"I think you see vulnerability as weakness, just like the speaker did in the beginning. You have to reshape your idea of it."
1,"Democrats, listen to this woman. Quit punching people because they voted for someone you don't ""approve"" of. Democrats stop screaming, be gentle and listen to those you hate. You might find out we're humans like you."

1,"Amen! Authenticity= courage to be imperfect!!! Let go of who you think you should be and be who you are. That is love your messes your not so perfectness as this is what makes the beauty in you shine.

0,"Shame and fear is taught in Buddhism as ""Deva dharma"""
1,"I watched ""The price of Shame"" by Monica Lewinsky. I thought: ""Your imperfections make my imperfections perfectly O.K."" I remember the whole scandal with Monica Lewinsky and President Clinton like it was yesterday. The comments on this video are disabled. I remember appreciating that this was so big in the news because it drew attention away from my mistakes.  Somebody should really put you on the temple prayer roll. I'm sorry you had to go through being America's scapegoat, Monica. I don't know about everybody else, but I love you.  Christine Ming"
1,Needed this. I’m always building up walls. Not wanting anyone to come emotionally closer. But eventually I have to let it down and talk to someone. Otherwise you’re just built up with anger and sadness
1,We are enough. People got their vulnerability. #11 TED
1,"It's so funnty how we have to research are research to find the simplest of truths that were right there all along, but hidden from us to keep us controled.   "
2,Still one of the best.

1,i cried during and after this
1,"I gave a #TEDx talk a month ago and Brene Brown was a huge #inspiration:
https://youtu.be/DKB5rR7QUac - to show up entirely #vulnerable and trust that people will relate! It was NOT easy but I am SO glad I did it - so many people  thanked me for my vulnerability, for sharing my #pain as well as my #joy so openly with the world. 

I talks about how to apply #gamification in your life in order to achieve more #success and #happiness - check it out and let me know what you think!!

1,It is a watershed moment when you realize everything you thought you knew about yourself  and what make you tick is wrong.  It leaves you with a very heavy heart for the time you have lost and the hurt you have caused.  Perhaps this realization may allow me to be a better man capable of being vulnerable of being human!
1,"Thank you for igniting vulnerability and creating so much fun, Ms. Brown.

All you have IS enough."
1,"This is often exactly how we learn what we might never learn ... by listening to others, whether you agree with any of them or not. ""To listen"" isn't really about proving who is right or wrong (even though that's what we often do(, but that it sparks, ignites ideas, thoughts, angles, perspectives outside of our own, of which, then generate further awareness within YOU! And when that third eye opens, it leads to greater levels of awareness - there isn't merely a single level; think flight of stairs. And what really can fling it all wide open is when you realize that we are all connected, we are all one. If you can't see how the dots connect, it's a long road to travel, until you do. Plus, once you do, you can't believe how you missed seeing it before. Something as simple as believing all things are possible, just widens your lens. We limit our own view/mindset when we refuse all other perspectives as not so. Don't short yourself bc you are the only one that can. Kind of like being stubborn - you miss out on a lot bc you made it so. How many times have you heard self or others say, ""My God, had I only known or realized that (whatever it was) long ago!"" There is no end to learning, nor awareness. It's the light."
2,Wow !!!!!! I m in Awe ! Breathtaking talk ! WOW! ! ! Thank you dear Brene Brown ! Wow !

""I've got to change and be brave and learn to be more vulnerable with you. I was watching this talk today""

And then after sending the video said ""These words in this talk almost made me cry:"" and quoted a paragraph of her talk where she said:

""To let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts, even though there's no guarantee, to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror, when we're wondering, ""Can I love you this much? Can I believe in this this passionately? Can I be this fierce about this?"" just to be able to stop and, instead of catastrophizing what might happen, to say, ""I'm just so grateful, because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive.""

1,"I've watched this multiple times when I feel scared and low - thank you, Brene'!!"
1,this lady is super boring and intellectual but i feel she's talking about something important
1,"So what's the take home message here?
Be authentic, vulnerable and courageous if you want to make friends and healthy relationships? Was that it? Or was it something more?"
2,What I like about this lady is that she's an intelligent comedian as well as a researcher/storyteller.  I like this stuff. 
2,This is great...thank you
1,"You know what, i knew what the issue was in my relationship with my girl. I knew she had this issue but i just didnt know what to call it. Brene Brown made it clear for me and now, i dont know how to tell this to my girl cause because of this very thing we are not together anymore. I'm like: Giving everything to a relation from which i might not get anything. On the other hand she is afraid of being unsuccessful although she loves me too."
1,"10 ted talks that you need to listen to

Now let's go to Netflix."
1,"I found this to be very well thought out, so much so that I had a hard time deciding to post a comment. Allowing ourselves to be vulnerable is most difficult. Like failure only those who are courageous will allow the experience and grow from it. "
1,Really- how to get laid? thats what you got from this?
1,"See, you don't have to. I ""have to"" is the problem. Be unworthy and love yourself for it! Like, i'm da BEST unworthy person living! I feel like shit most of the time but it's ok. And it is ok. Start taking your unworthy side. The only one you should compare yourself with is you. Cause, as Dr Seuss says, there is no one alive who is youer than you. Amen!"
1,"This hit home, so hard. Should I see a therapist? But I don't want to talk about my childhood and family and stuff."
1,I regularly listen to this talk!
1,I love this one and find myself stumbling upon it whenever I need a little pick me up. Thank y'all so much for posting this.
1,"To those saying she is not being vulnerable: the very act of being on stage is vulnerability. Talking about such a taboo subject is vulnerable. Vulnerability does not always take the shape of a crying face in front of others. It is simply us being authentic in spite of the fact that in doing so, we allow others to demean who we really are, authentically. That is vulnerability. I will attain this one day soon. "
1,"She is smart, articulate, humorous and insightful.  I watched this and her other talks years ago and they changed my life.  I rewatch them every couple months as reminders to myself that I (and everyone) is WORTHY!"
1,powerful words.
1,I really enjoyed this talk and it made a lot of sense
1,"Therefore making the accusation valid only as a way of calling one out to 'define' themselves, not by 'showing their face' which is NOT what I'm asking, but by expressing what they mean by such pointless conjectures as ""She's stupid, and this is sappy crap."".. To me, that's a Troll, and I don't care about this guys video, because it's logic is self serving."
1,How can you advertise a multi billion dollar company like Cisco and not pay the presenters..
1,"What I loved the most about this, is that she sort of dove into something that scared her.  I truly believe courage is not the absence of fear, but the willingness to act in spite of it.  She showed real courage."
1,I see this in my kids. The more secure and connected...the more willing to admit fault and be vulnerable. Absolutely loved this talk and all your research.
2,"Brenè Brown, I would love to have a conversation with you."
2,This is the best video on youtube

2,Thx q so much
1,just go with story-teller
1,I appreciate your gift smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes What I am curious about why is it ppl say don't put your emotions into someone when you care for the person otherwise you appear weak if you show vulnerability state.
1,I watched this for the first time 10 years ago and it changed my life. This is my first time rewatching since and I cried lol. I guess I have more work to do
2,Thank you!clapping_handsclapping_handsclapping_handsclapping_handsclapping_handsclapping_hands
2,Thank you Dr. Brown
1,Thank you for changing the game René. After everything we are human beings with a soul. TED has always been serious and heavy but after watching this am willing to listen to more TED talks that are very realistic and full of research ofcourse  after all we watch to learn.
1,"What she calls vulnerability is just risktaking capability. People willing to take a chance. to invent in a thing with unclear outcome. I don't understand why she calls it vulneravbility. it's bollocks.
Of course you can connect if you are willing to take a risk. Of course people whose willingness to take risks hase completely tried up (maybe due to too many bad experiences or traumatic events) cannot make connections anymore.
I wonders what is supposed to be so groundbreaking about that stufff?"
1,thank god magic powers drove me to your netflix show and now am on it. cannot stop watching. listening. researching. gonna take the leap now! thank you so much for inspiring us so amazing smiling_face_with_heart-eyes

2,"I am so very grateful to have discovered you, thank you for illuminating what is so crucial to our very core.  Listening to your podcast has been my saving grace through the pandemic, thank you."
1,Yeah. Which kinda contradicts the message of this video if you think about it.
1,WILLINGNESS TO DO SOMETHING EVEN THERE IS NO GAURANTEE...
1,POV: you’re an acting student told to watch this
1,"I'm very muting to my vulnerabilities, I don't know what they are exactly. At first I was gonna say: "" It can exist without measurement we have not developed a proper balance yet. Through humanity, we have developed measures later."" Which now rings metaphorically true for me!"
1,I would bet money that I could break brene because literally allllll of what she said was bullshit
1,"Its easy to say being vulnerable is power but I don't think so. In-fact its give a chance to others to take advantage of it. As you said, human world is imperfect, everyone is not compassionate. Its better to tell those who can understand it."
1,My therapist sent me here too!
1,where's the secret treasure chest?
1,Rewatching again (for the fifth time) after another class showed it! (Thanks health and happiness)
1,"What I found when I made myself vulnerable was that it was ok to be me, that it was ok to love myself, it's not vanity it's being compassionate to me.  I stopped being a victim and took responsibility for my life, I've made mistakes and most likely will continue to make many more but that's ok too.  What you see in the world is a reflection of what you feel and think.  Blame doesn't come into it, I am an adult and my mum was working with her internal conflict.  Every emotional scar has helped create the person I am today, not perfect but beautifully imperfect.  I am so thankful I broke because I found the light within, I believe in me and the path I am now following."
1,"All the thumbs down here, are the crazies who are not Calle of companion and in severe need of therapy, with zero clue. The rest, we are all incredibly grateful for this amazing message and human being! From the bottom of my heart, fully, THANK YOU! raising_handssparkling_heartyou have made a huge difference for me. This should be a must see for all schools, college sociology classes. A must see for all parents, and children. For the entire, world."

1,Who else is watching this in October 2019? Omg I'm fascinated and getting so informed!
1,Who else is because of the Dr. V 2020 challenge:)
1,Does anyone have a summary/keynotes of this available?
1,"I have ZERO feelings of connection with anyone. I have Complex PTSD and I can't trust anyone. I have dealt with my shame/guilt etc. through EMDR therapy but I can't let myself be vulnerable because I believe I will be hurt by others. I believe that I am worthy but that others will attack me. Sorry, but I don't buy most of what is said here."
1,I don't agree with this talk
1,I'm currently trying to court a woman.. I'm DEFINATELY sending her this video.. =)
1,Very powerful and important talk!   Thank-you!!!
2,"This in an amazing speech, thank You"
1,"@sausage4mash Therefore, anyone claiming a 'troll' to exist could also themselves be a 'troll', and without explicitly defining intention how exactly can one 'define' who a troll is. Sure, the video defines describing someone as a 'troll' as terminology used to be offensive and ultimately a 'cop-out'. Because as he says ""You're not describing a troll, you're bastardizing it's original denotation!' Then give me a 'true' troll! Unless one explicitly agrees or denies there is no proof of either."
1,"Connections means Relationships.
Relationships is founded on Understanding.
Understanding is discovered through Vulnerability.

UNDERSTANDING is the key element that brings it all together."

2,Awesome - thanks!
1,you created something amazing storyteller researcher. thanks for your job
1,"Reading the comments I just can't understand why this is inspirational to people? Maybe I've misunderstood the concept she was talking about, but as I understood it, it was about ""embracing vulnerability"" - however, isn't this like saying you should embrace weakness, so that way you can connect with other people who are also weak? I'm sorry but I would like to see her admit that she found her husband attractive because he was ""vulnerable"" and he let himself be ""fully seen"", loving her ""wholeheartedly"" from the first moment... Yeah I'm sure  that wouldn't make any woman run away and not think that he was a bit ""too much"". 
My favourite phrases were:
- ""The one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're not worthy of connection"" (like the fear of doing something is what keeps us from doing that something?)
- ""Vulnerability is the core for shame and fear and struggle of worthiness, but it's also the birthplace of joy, creativity, love."" (so depression is the birthplace of bliss then?)
- ""They were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were."" (nice cliche)
- ""To feel this vulnerable means I'm alive."" (brilliant)"
1,"Being vulnerable is so scary and difficult however I'm pretty sure what she's saying is true...If you don't make yourself vulnerable...you miss out on as much good stuff in life, as bad stuff..."
1,"I lost the fight but probably I won my life back, beautiful and well said :-)"
1,"This was an AWESOME talk....I recommend this for anyone........Great job, Brene."
1,"Extremely well put! In my struggle to become whole I've found that vulnerability helps us understand and integrate important parts of our inner self, which kills shame and instead helps us accepting ourselves as we are, all parts of us, and with this in the end love ourselves...."
1,i think it's funny
1,"Nice to live in such a cream-puff world: today I had the pleasure of meeting a 21 year old named Rob who lives on the East side of Detroit. He hoped his school might create either a chess club or open the basketball court because ""there's nothing to do around here but to get into trouble."" He went on to relate how he had three kids (3, 2, and 1/2), had learned chess in prison, from which he'd just been released a few weeks ago, and somewhere along the line had got himself shot."" —All of which he related with the matter-of-fact-ness of someone telling you what they ate for lunch!  . . .  Count yourself lucky if all you have to deal with is stuff like waiting for the doctor to call back with test-results, and wondering if you can get your daughter into Yale. ""Nice work if you can get it"" —saith I. (Excuse me.)"
2,lol these people....
1,i refuse to stay here another ten fucking years
2,Sooo true! cuts right into your heart 
1,"Why did she need to insult storytellers? The amount of media consumed by humans says alone that we love stories, and widely respect storytellers."

1,Is it only me? I find this talk quite confusing with many distractions.
1,Forever inspired by Brene’s TED Talk! movie_cameraheart_suit
1,Her interview with Russell Brand made me look this up. June 2019.
2,"Thank you for posting this, TED."
1,"i've read from 13 things mentally strong women don't do by amy morin about this vulnerability too, and i wanted to expand it by watching this, and i agree with miss bren that we shall allow ourselves to be vulnerable and to be seen so in this way, we'll feel the joy, encouragement, and know ourselves red_heart"
2,Wow! Just wow! So much I didn't understand about myself and others!
0,that's why i hate scientists
1,Vulnerability would be no problem if there would be no assholes in the world.
1,"I've watched this so many times, but just now picked up on the politics and certainty piece.  It's spot on.  People not only want to be heard, they want to be right and applauded, and lauded.  When they're not, they shut down.  It's sad.  Thin skin these days."

1,This is such a wonderful talk!
1,Going back to read my book
1,I was fine until . Then manly tears were shed.
1,they believe they're worthy is easy to say. HOW to get that belief is the tricky part and are people who do not feel that way permanently incapable due to whatever??? How does a non-courageous person become courageous? It is a lot of work if you are undoing your life's result. PS: cool shirt that looks a completely different color from each angle. Brown is so funny that way. PPS: 12 step programs have been taking peeps through this forever. 
1,I mean I don't know .... I just wanna kiss this person!
1,Little did she know that her career would change for the better from a 20 minute talk
1,"i have been following the Johnny Depp defamation trial and am gratefully struck by his vulnerability. What i miss most about my own son of 26 is his beautiful vulnerability. The more i touch upon my own .. allows me greater insight into who i am genuinely am and only wish to be more so .. of. Thank you, so very much."
1,pov: u listened to lexi hildago’s second podcast
2,Profound. Thank you.
1,Automagically coming back to watch it annually. 9 years ago damn.
1,I told my therapist to watch this...
2,Thanks Netflix
1,Spendid discourse. What I learned smiling_face_with_heart-eyes When we want to numb our vulnerabilities....we cancel the negative emotions & positive emotions alike...and after we complain that we lack deep feelings & meaningful emotions in our life...Oh. If we were only able to stay imperfect in the light smiling_face_with_heart-eyestulipsunflowermaple_leaf
1,I'd like to get some more detailed and practical things from the speech that I can applied to my life :(
2,She deserves a Nobel Prize I think

2,"I love her talk :) 
I believe this is one of the most interesting and useful talks I have ever seen (:
I am very grateful as I did watch it :))))))))))))
Enjoy the talk and I bet you guys 'll love it  ;)"
1,"I never get tired of listening to Brene. As a social worker myself, I find myself going to her when I feel ""less than,"" and her work always helps ground me."
1,"Yeah, unfortunately that is what these psichologists and researchers often overlook. They are throwing these things out there so easily as if we were living in a unviolent world. If you let yourself be vulnerable you'd be surprised how few people get it and react to it."
1,I didn't watch the video.
1,"As somebody who works as a scientist myself, I look at this talk a bit more critically. I do like her presence during the talk and her message is inherently a positive and well-meant one. But I think one should keep in mind what her research method is. As she tells herself, her insights are apparently based on qualitative interviews. This means that she basically had a long series of presumably very intense conversations with people and wrote them down. Then she read and re-read this conversations repeatedly, until she came up with the pattern she is reporting. In her case this is: People who have the feeling of being connected/loved, are 1) feeling that they are deserving of this and 2) are ready to demonstrate vulnerability. While this is perhaps ok to report like this (although it is a very subjective approach), I find her next step more problematic. She goes on to imply a causality between showing vulnerability and having the feeling of being connected/loved. This results in the simple message: ""Showing your vulnerability is good, because that leads to real connections and therefore the feeling of being loved"". However, the causality doesn't have to go in this direction. One could easily think of different explanations for the pattern she is reporting. It could for example go the other way: Because people are feeling connected they are ready to show vulnerability. In this case amping up your demonstration of vulnerability wouldn't lead to better connections. This is basic scientific reasoning. All in all I think her messages are too simplistic in nature. To me she makes more the impression of a motivational speaker/life coach type of person instead of a researcher. If it helps people, this doesn't have to be a bad thing, but I think its just something to keep in mind."
1,I needed to hear this today. Thank You!
1,"Personally, it wasn't a therapist but  Super Soul Sunday.  Educated professionals , writers    that over the years first discovered themselves and meanings for their life."
1,"I tend to hold my emotions inside, which ends up backfiring on me. I'm going to work on being more vulnerable. (:"
1,People who feel worthy had a primary care giver who was very attentive in a loving way during their first 6 years. After that we're set for life. Attachment theory. People who don't receive proper emotional support as infants and toddlers can never over come it and most do not know why they are so deeply troubled.
1,Brene’s message is incredibly life giving and soul soothing. Grateful for her authenticity and genuine sharing her life with her audience.
1,"courage - compassion - connection = Hagakure
I am enough = Zen

Nice to see that todays western Scientizism comes to the same conclusions that parts of humanity has known for centuries :)"
1,I worked for a company that uses shame to manage people. i am SO glad I left.
1,I need to see her research because who did you do the research over? In what settings did you do this research? In what manner did you do this research? What she's saying is fundamentally true but not accessible to Everyone in every situation and if not put into perspective can be used to dismiss certain folks.
2,"If you accept who you are, how will you ever know what you can be ?"
1,"""Blinded by self-importance.... the visionaries of society haven't the vision of a blind musician nor the perception of a churchmouse_""
~~cc"
2,Story Telling is brilliant - that's what good speakers are.  Great video share - thank you.
1,"I'm so disappointed. She simplifies everything. I had two doctors recommend me this video as if it was ""THE ANSWER"". I think Brene speaks from a place of privilege. In the first few minutes of the video she explains her shock and surprise that people live completely disconnected lives like mine. And then she continues to explain how all we need is positive human interaction. Great. What if that's not possible? What if every interaction you have is tainted by stigma and as a result further increases the shame you feel? Some people are traumatised beyond return. I want connection but it is not possible for me. I can't trust anyone and every interaction I have only hurts me more and further increases my feelings of shame. No one will ever see me as I am or wants to. I am so tired of people acting like all you need to do is go out and find the right people. They are not out there. For some, isolation is the only choice. Stop telling me what my fucking meaning in life is. I think I can decide for myself."
1,"I like the overall message and key insights, which were that a state of vulnerability can incline one toward defense mechanisms that can undermine self-acceptance, particularly how numbing has a scattershot effect of targeting positive emotions in addition to the negative ones.  She gives you a guide on how to react to the pain of being vulnerable, which is helpful.  But nothing is said about the external conditions that give rise to a state of vulnerability, and whether or not those conditions can be changed by utilizing a positive response toward being vulnerable.  In reality, if other people believe that you don't belong, your personal sense of self-acceptance and responding appropriately to being vulnerable will not necessarily change their views no matter how much you feel self-worthy.  Sometimes you just need to find new people.  Because otherwise if you keep making yourself vulnerable without positive regard, eventually you’ll look like a fool and there will be the danger of reversing self-acceptance and personal integrity."
2,Grand Army anyone?
2,"To be vulnerable, taking risks, doing what you love and greeting each day with gratitude is to move through life as who you are and were meant to be. This is where joy ultimately resides. Thank you Brene!"
1, I read a book The Heart and the Bottle with my middle school students every year and it’s about the consequences of numbing emotions. That when we suppress the bad emotions we stifle our ability to live life fully
2,this is better than any sermon

1,"""You know what? You are imperfect, and you wired for struggle but you are worthy of love and belonging."" "
1,"Your brain cannot tell the difference between fiction and reality (because there is a very thin line between them). So the stories you tell it shape your existence. Tell your brain new stories and you will shape a new reality. I spent 15 years denying this because of how irrational it sounded. Until life got really tough. So I decided to stRt changing the inner monologue and my life changed in a matter of days. First my mood lifted, then my actions started changing and then of course my life started changing. It's a chain reaction that all starts in the brain."
1,Vulnerability is so powerful. Thank you for talking about this!
1," Courage

1,For over 30 years I've be working with people as a lifestyle coach. To listen to your talk now at a ripe age is nothing short of amazing. So amazing I let it all sit in side me and came back to it the next night to watch all over again. Brilliant. 
1,Thumbs of if you think she looks like Skyler White....
2,So impactful! Thanks for sharing this Bill Soroka!
1,You can't measure love. Does that mean it doesn't exist?
1,"she should just try and go for enlightenment, everything else will just revert back to its original state"
1,i saw the other day a comment on her book in amazon that said that the book was not good because she uses really common language for a woman with university studies. I'll never understand how people pretend critical and important information to reach a large population using really specific and confusing terms just to give the image of profesionalism. This woman is really good at communicating and is explaining something useful and important.
1,I was eating a banana nut muffin while watching this. rolling_on_the_floor_laughing So good. The talk AND the muffin.
0,if i have to be annoyed i'm going to be annoying
1,"We need fear, shame, and vulnerability so we can learn to overcome and deal with them in order to experience true joy, confidence, and love.
Totally agree with her perspective on our children. They're imperfect and will face struggles, and it's up to us to help them learn and grow, not stifle, overprotect, or force them into stuff."
1,I can so relate to her being vulnerable is not easy for me

1,She was stuck on the left side of her brain and found a way to open the right - wholeness gained.
1,"I think God created us to experience vulnerability so that we may find the value of being faithful in God. Believing in God could be a way to find comfort in face of problems we experience in ourselves as well as those reflected in our world. So it is like a cycle. We feel vulnerable because God made us so. And some of us use faith so they can learn to stay strong, whole-hearted, and accept themselves as vulnerable beings."
1,I’m naturally a vulnerable person because it feels right and really good to be true to myself but it’s bloody hard! Most people see your openness and vulnerability as weakness and either take advantage of you or look down on you. Luckily these people only hang around for a short while winking_face

2,"this conduct me to a little breakdown (laughs)

It's very interesting how they made the audience comfortable as enough to laugh of her problems and how she permits (or maybe even conducts) the audience to laugh to it"
2,To be vulnerable is to express true intimacy with someone you truly love and care about.
1,literally the best ted talk I have ever watched
1,"had to watch it twice to understan it better. really cool ted talk. Brene Brown, i have a lot of respect for her now."
1,"Vulnerability gives flexibility to emotions.
That's no light contribution to an individual's learning, exploring, adapting And WOW there are many examples! I'm gonna tackle this one, don't have enough autism.
I've noticed that people gives me a pass and tend to follow me more often when I feel a lot (I don't have to express it in some major way). And vulnerability is kinda like 'the cracking of the shell which encloses my understanding' of how I can relate to stuff, letting it grow bigger. And putting it into song can move people to tears. I can literary use my emotions as telequenesis to drown bugs. If you don't think that's over the world borderline magic then eehh what ever."

1,One of the fun things I discovered was taking responsibility for my mistakes. It freaks people in the blame culture out no end.
1,This talk changed my life for the better.
1,Continued:  Of course there is a question about why does God call us good(or very good) in Genesis.  Is it because of the image of God that we have when he created us.  Another words is it innate and now in ourselves?   Or is it something that God proclaims upon us?  Again much more complexthan just thinking that you deserve to be loved.  I guess just because.  Then again I these same people think we all think that some others do not deserve to be loved.  
1,"This is incredible. I was almost sure that I would not watch it the whole way through, but I could not skip it. This was one of the most illuminating things I've heard, and it teaches me lessons that I could never have learned on my own about myself and why I'm insecure and why I have parts of myself that I don't always want to acknowledge, and why I don't always put myself out there, and why I'm scared to tell other people how I really feel. I'm so grateful to you for doing this research, and it really makes me hope that in the future I can work toward becoming the person I want to be based off of this amazing, amazing stuff you've shared on that stage."

At the same time, I realized myself I took a lot of courage to feel vulnerable."
2,haha! she tries to sound like she knows about the subject she is talking about.
2,Wonderful! God bless this womam. I am reading her book.
1,"No one will be listening to this lady in ten years.
There will just be some new self help guru peddling the same ideas in whatever package fits the psychological fashions of the time.
If you doubt me, let me ask you one question. Have you ever heard of a man named Wayne Dyer?
He's the man many consider, if not the founder, than certainly the perfector of the modern self help book. He was bigger in his day (the 70s to 90s) than Brene Brown will probably ever be.
And yet, if you're under the age of 40-something I doubt you've ever of him, let alone read anything by him.
And that's just my point.
If self help books had real lasting value, wouldn't people keep reading them after their authors have passed from the scene?"

1,pleaz can sommbody tell me what she said in two line in arabic
2,This is by far THE BEST Ted Talk I have ever listen to. Thank you so much Brené Brown for being brave and sharing this talk. You are truly amazing.
1,he's probably right
1,did not know this was a common therapist video lolllll
2,"Wow, this was absolutely mind-blowing, like literally i am trying to collect pieces of my mind out there floating in the ideas that she shared. Thanks a lot for sharing this, really appreciate it."
1,I think I've watched this 3 times and it looks like I may watch it more.
1,We must believe that “we are enough”
1,"Pure example of the power of the feminine energy. A woman in alignment can lead this world into a place a man hasn’t yet. Until she raises the man who could. All and all the divine feminine has so much power, because of love."
1,"I've watched with quite a few times over the years.  Today I realized something that feels important.  As someone who ""struggles for a sense of love and belonging"" this talk always left me feeling a little ashamed of myself for not being able to magically make the leap into the sense of being worthy of such things.  Over the past few years I've formed some remarkable friendships with people who have that strong sense and are able to regard me in such a manner that I start to feel it too.  The thing is, we don't magically get there on our own.  Ideally, this is something that our parents would instill in us by their treatment of us, themselves, each other, and the world.  Unfortunately this is VERY rarely the case.  The things missing from this talk:  a simple acknowledgment that there ARE reasons WHY humanity is experiencing an epidemic lack of self-worth and thus love and belonging.   And also a tangible approach to how to we might endeavor to aquire it.  It doesn't just magically happen and we can't do it ourselves; connection is a key part of how we gain the sense of our worth."
1,Very powerful and insightful. I am forever changed.
2,"We are worthy because of God’s grace, He loves us despite us not deserving it whatsoever, such a blessing to follow the Lord & be loved folded_hands_medium_skin_tonered_heart"
1,"Everyone out there seriously needs to get the audio book ""The Power of Vulnerability"" by Brene. This is just a snipet of what she has learned about vulnerability and shame and empathy and so much more. It's truly worth listening to. It has changed my life red_heart"
1,Yogis and Buddhists have been saying this for many hundred years.
1,researcher sounds even worse
1,"Awesome, thank you! my new favorite speaker, author, story teller, lol."
1,Holy god that was emotional asf
1,Wine Country brought me here. Thank you ladies.
1,Great talk about something so important. You need to look after yourself before you can look after other people. Also like that it comes from the heart (literally and in terms of translation) Leadership with courage is vital!
2,Well said. Great message!
1,I.LOVE.HER.
1,When did Martha Stewart started giving speeches thinking_face
1,"Hey Brene, my name is taylor. I know this is a long shot but here it goes. I've always had unhealthy relationships. I know where it stem froms (my childhood) I grew up poor abused neglected ect. I am gay as well. I was a very kind and open person. Over time life had changed me. One of the more pressing issues I have is that I have an extremely hard time keeping a job. I want and need too be better. I've met the man of my dreams and currently in a life altering change. Would you please email me for further talk I'd be forever in your debt, please! Taylorjoelcrawford@gmail.com"
1,I need this Ted talk seared onto my brain.
1,All opinion and putting her own meaning of things onto things. bs
1,I'm sharing this with my entire family.
1,"tht talk open my mind to somethin i used to feel ,thanks "
1,"a therapist that I had in 2017 recommended Brene's TED talks and books to me. Vulnerability is still something I struggle with, but I've watched these videos a few times over the years and they do help <3"
1,"what a GOLDEN video, i think this deserves to be seen by everyone, so many powerful lines of dialogue and key points. i have gone through my own ""spiritual awakening"" aka crying for 20 minutes on my bed while infront of my mums company who i would always hide emotion from because i was worried about how she would see me as such a weak person. but after that and followed by a few more tears in the coming weeks after that moment. and now im at a point where i just accept things for what they are and who people are and who i am as a whole, and life has been so much less stressful and worrisome. i have found a strong sense of calm come into my life and things have been up ever since."
1,Keep at it brother. =)
1,"THIS! ... amazing way of explaining smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes

I have chronic illnesses and disability... and once I accepted my vulnerability I became happier.

We have to open ourselves up to live a life full."
2,wow!  What a wonderful talk and lesson for us all!!!

2,Wow... That was an eye opener :) Thanks!
1,I first heard this talk in 2010. It was exactly what I needed to hear. It put into words what I had already intuitively felt. This talk changed my life. Thank you Brene Brown.
2,i love this
1,this is so beautiful she has so much knowledge
2,She could be a comedian. Great talk
1,"Holy cow, she's funny!"
2,Great talk! Props from Germany:)
1,Who else is here because you have to do a writing assignment about this speech
2,I received this from a friend of mine.  I enjoyed it.
1,"I think that 'opportunity for growth,' however weak and shaky it may make you feel, is a lot more helpful than 'I am enough.'

If you start from 'I am enough,' nothing happens. Sorry."
2,What a funny and brilliant talk. loved it! haha
1,felt like she was talking about me the entire video
1,"What a HACK!! Everyone is vulnerable to varying degrees, everyone has shame in varying degrees, everyone has some level of empathy, vanity, fear, etc. Everyone only needs to look inward to know this. You don't need to listen to someone who wasted 6 years researching a characteristic that GOD gave all of us."
1,"Life's messy.
Werr9 spirit on a human journey.
We evolve in messy and lean our lessons for assention."
1,"All my of philosphy accuared from Doctor House just collapsed. I mean doctor house taught me how to avoid/numb feelings and be misrable and then comes this   lol, I just got check mated"
2,Spot on. Thank you for inspiring me to become more vulnerable and to relax into myself. Words of wisdom.
1,"I truly enjoyed watching your presentation. The information that you presented hit home in a really big way! It helps me look at myself more closely and how I have viewed vulnerability as a negative rather than a positive. It is strange, because just about a week ago I expressed to a friend how I was feeling about the loss of my mother and how my father's illness brings a great deal of fear for me. I apologized for being so open and  he stated that my vulnerability was beautiful. I didn't quite know how to interpret that because often times I have viewed my vulnerability as being a weakness, making me a weaker person. Your presentation was enlightening. I thought the part about dating and asking someone out is making oneself vulnerable. With online dating as the norm today, it would be interesting to find more information tied to vulnerability, how to move past shame due to constant rejection (there are usually at least 50 people on a dashboard lol) and how to stay true to yourself (being yourself) through the journey. I think a lot of men and women are struggling with this issue!"
1,"This was my very first time I saw her and her poignant message. So much of it resonated with me on so many levels, and I still recall how appreciative I was of it all. Then she went all Hollywood, is all I can say.  Still inspirational but it's become more ""show"" imho."
1,Vulnerability is the key to all and any human connections. Without that key ingredient there will always be something missing within a relationship. Being able to be completely transparent with someone you love is a gift that some people never get to experience.
1,Probably the best Ted talk I have ever watched.
1,"Regarding vulnerability as weakness is just a perception of western society. I, as an Asian (Korean), did not grow in a society where vulnerability is regarded as weakness. There are many perspectives which many people regard them as absolute truths but actually are not at all."
1,"this is an AMAZING talk, everything said here shows wisdom and growth and real realization. I would watch this 100x if I had the time amazing amazing amazing work."
1," , Do not follow the trend!"
2,and all this time i thought we were best friends
1,"Bren'e Brown shared something she learned, ""if you cannot measure it, you cannot learn it.""  It makes sense as we as SPED teachers also know that ""if you want it done, you need to set a deadline by when task needs to be mastered.""  I liked what she said, ""that people who feel they are worthy and belong, are whole hearted and compassionate, and face their shortcomings (honesty to share what  their imperfections are).  They are human and vulnerable."
1,To this day the best thing I ever did was  obtain a BA in social science/social work. I didn’t continue in the field. Its so funny how I planned to fix others instead I realized how much I needed fixing and it gave me the tools to do that!
1,"The flight or fight response relies on vulnerability to work. If you do not feel vulnerable, you will have a hard time tapping into that energy. When I confronted and won a fight against my bully, I didn't do it because I felt strong. I was laughed at all the time, and I was the butt of all of the ""future school shooter"" and ""Borat"" jokes. I fought back because I felt very vulnerable, and I knew that my dignity and well-being relied on those hits connecting. My bully did not feel vulnerable at all, so he was not ready despite having the size advantage. He ran off with tears in his eyes after a couple of minutes. I won my dignity because I was willing to make myself extremely vulnerable for a couple of minutes. 

I personally think that it's a bad idea to display your emotions and vulnerabilities for everyone and their grandma to see, but I think you should not be afraid to do it if you have to. Everything that's considered ""great"" in this world, from great battles to great artworks to great philosophies and great chess games have one thing in common: They are great because people put their souls into their work, and were not afraid to show their true colors and vulnerabilities. We are all still animals and have animal instincts, but that's not a bad thing."
2,I enjoy this
1,"At about  I just noticed how deathly silent the audience is.  It's like they're hardly breathing, they're listening so hard.  :)"
1,One of my most favourite Youtube videos EVER!!
1,"Great Talk, this is the start to my journey of vulnerability, posting a youtube comment on a talk on vulnerability."
1,"@BlueSappho92 When the video started, I glanced at the comments, and when I saw yours, I went ""B.S!"" and decided to give it five minutes. Now I can see how you could easily watch this video over 20 times!!! Folks, just give it 10 minutes and you will be totally enthralled. And you'll want to share it when it's finished!!!"
1,Her empathy video brought me here
1,"She's a crazy woman trying to explain something that needs no explanation and comes naturally to people who are comfortable with themselves. I'm not even a cynical person, and that's what I honestly think."
2,Love this talk. Speaks so many truths. I laughed and cried. Thank you  Dr. Brown.
1,I found this video in 2022 (this video is 11years ago) and i found this link from twitter
1,what do she mean? tell me please
2,Still love this one.
1,POV: You watched this in your IOP group.
1,"Going from a strong and confidant single woman that most people admired for the strength and ability to bounce back.. To an in love and vulnerable woman who became unhinged through the lack of education and awareness of  personality disorders surrounding her.
It has taken 18 months of extreme research and therapy to make the smallest improvement after the effects of PTSD..
Vulnerability can have a huge cost attached to it...
Make sure you can afford it..and educate yourself about personality disorders.
There is a staggering population..infact an epidemic of personality disorders lurking out there..
These wolves are dressed and extremely well disguised as sheep..you'd never pick some of them..(THAT IS..UNTIL YOU EDUCATE YOURSELF. )
These people don't have a soul and..WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO TRY AND DESTROY YOU..
It's not only them...but their ""followers"".. (flying monkey's)...that in reality are nothing more than sheep themselves.ramewerameweramewerameweramewerameweramewerameweramewerameweramewerameweramewerameweramroosterroosterroosterroosterroosterroosterroosterroosterroosterroosterrooster"
1,"Misleading heading...It should be something like ""The Courage to be vulnerable"". According to her tedtalk there's nothing powerful in vulnerability. The thing is that ""stronger"" people have the guts to face situations where they will become vulnerable and take it like a man.

But I like the core message. No more ""everyone is special and amazing""-shit for our children. Just teach em to be imperfect and live with it with dignity."
1,"@ ""You know what, you're imperfect and you're wired for struggle - but you are worthy of love and belonging."" Dont try to make the uncertain certain."
1,Amazing talk!  Incredibly powerful and life changing!  Well worth viewing again and again!
1,So that would mean...vulnerability is lack of ego
0,"""Kill the demons you kill the angels too"" --Rilke"
1,"What is ""connection"". What is she talking about when she says that word?"
1,"""You are imperfect, you are wired for struggle. But you are worthy of love and belonging."""
1,I'm gearing up to kill myself and the guy I talked to told me to watch this
1,"POWERFUL! Thank you so much! Bottom line is, suppressed emotions will mess up your life in a very big way. Time to heal all those inner wounds and free myself forever!!!"
1,If sensual is be submissive to seduction...fragile is be submissive to strenght...
1,This is probably the 5th time I've watched this in four years.  Love it more every time I see it.
1,This was amazing...Live from here
1,"The word research suggests that we go look and maybe find something that was never really lost yet now found again. Re search = look for it again. We knew and know all this yet misplaced it in ourselves, now found again."
2,lol I was just about to say the same thing. haha
1,Chatgpt gives me link of this video
1,Vulnerability is at the heart of feeling a sense of true belonging!
1,"Hmm, here's the thing, being mortal makes us vulnerable, making ourselves enough money to survive is an inevitable and current human condition that needs to evolve beyond that. So being boss is about creating an environment where it is your job to make others accountable. If you are entry level/ minimum wage it is those above you whom are accountable but you are totally dispensable as there are so many that can replace you. Creeping out of entry level pays better, increasing your ability to survive better in the short term, but then you are accountable and disposable.

 In the work environment and the employment climate, turns out you are better represented in criminal law than you are in employment law. In criminal law you have someone who defends you and cross examines those who are prosecuting. In employment law you have yourself and a representative who supports rather than defends you. Being boss is a minority privilege,  meaning that the masses are actually disadvantaged and basically squabbling over the crumbs. So, if we were ever to overcome the human condition, as a species, we would need to adopt the attitude that we will never truly survive, (long term), unless we decide that we are all responsible for nurturing each and everyone of our species to reach one another's fullest and best intentioned potential. As opposed to appealing to the lowest possible denominator in terms of morality. 

Breaking down the financial system in exchange of resourced based economy, (the equal distribution of safe, secure and sanitised shelter, nutritious food and water are the basic survival needs of a resource based economy). Currently there are more people in the world who have access to a smart phone than there are people who have access to a toilet! 
Utopia is a journey towards a positive goal that may never be reached but reaps it's rewards along the way. A world full of bosses who embrace their vulnerabilities to achieve their success is great but we will always need people who perform the tasks below them. So respect those above and below by affording of our species access to basic resources."
1,imho hoary old privileged white ladies like this are standing uo for the african american people
1,"...that""s all I have.""  is how this video ends but it was the beginning of so much more.  Thank you for the courage, compassion and sharing the science of the human condition.  I deeply valued you being authentic in such a large venue.  This is powerful...and is timely inspiration during the summer of 2014!

I highly recommend this TedTalk.  Dr. Brown, do know that You are MORE!  You are phenomenal woman!!!  I offer you: Confidence.  Competence.  Control.
Thank you Dr. Brown.  I hope to meet you someday.  Perhaps we can collaborate in the classroom on some project.
Definitely will be sharing during my workshop with a local non profit organization!

1,"Thought provoking.  Dr. spends too much time talking about herself, “First I did this, then I did that…”  before getting to any substance.  Fascinating theory!"
1,"Very good talk, although I don't think I can accept vulnerability. Just the word makes me twitch."
1,"I got so much from this talk.  Thank you so much, Brené.  I shall be sharing it with others.  We all need to learn to become more vulnerable."

1,You say more about yourself in your comment than anything you have said about me.  The God of Christianity is nothing like Harry Potter.  I think you have been listening to too many speeches by the new atheists who make many categorial mistakes like the one you did above. Easy answer to you.  Whydo you think you know what realityis or do not make reality fit your worldview especiallyy since you do not know what reality really is? 
1,"*All thoughts, feelings and emotions come from the mind, and they are not real unless you give them life. You just have to recognize them for what they are, and they will disappear, and true life will appear*. You must know you are not your mind. It lets you think you are but that is a mindtrick. Google *TruthContest read the Present* to unslave yourself from the overbearing infected mind. The mind uses mindchatter, negative thought, badhabbits, addictions to keep you under his control. You really would need a inner quest to face your inner demons and fear permantly. The *Truth* gives you the key."
1,"What could be more vulnerable than a child, and yet ""they're hard-wired for struggle"".  If this is so, then maybe it's because they have a natural acceptance at birth for struggle, and then as the years go on this acceptance of struggle gets chipped away to the point where we as invulnerable adults become more hard-wired for a nonconfrontational existance"
1,That was abrupt -_-
1,There are no words to describe the physical reactions my body is showing me whilst watching this TED talk. Every human should watch it once in a while to be reminded what makes this world a better place - authentic vulnerability. THank you Brene Brown!
1,"(well), all living matter exists within the confines of the laws of physics that it cannot escape from, laws which are perfect truth, that do not change, not bound by time, so in this light, our true nature is perfect in sight, sound, smell, touch, taste....feeling? Our true nature is really not any different than all living matter life forms, as much as we may egotistically, for whatever reasoning, think...or more accurately, not think so.  Heaven is our oneness feelings"

1,Brene Brown..... Mike dropmicrophone
2,Loved this TED talk.
1,"Thank you for sharing . And Yes, there are definitely ways to create new habits that don't take years to develop. I was raised in a very similar upbringing, and it wasn't until I attended my first weekend workshop that really got deep into sharing ourselves authentically and also learning from others and ourselves that I realized how important vulnerability really is into having what's important in my life like love and connection and also creating success in my career.  You can definitely look into weekend workshops that are about two or three days that create profound differences in our lives. I attended one called Being the Change from Challenge Day, and another called Landmark, which is worldwide. Both have made significant differences in peeling away the onion layers as some may put it.  Once we continue to do our inner work and discover underneath each layer the lifelong patterns that we've had since birth, then were able to continue creating new possibilities. I've been able to achieve many great things from these workshops that have made profound differences in my life, and it really does take practice to continuously be in the new conversation that we want to create for ourselves.  Hope that helps !  And healing and being kind to ourselves is a lifelong practice. I realized that there is no quick fix to anything and all great leaders have coaches to keep them in that practice to continue fulfilling whatever it is that they want to achieve in their lives.  :)"

1,"There is a repetitive mindset in the comments section about believing that you should just ""be truthful and be yourself"" instead of trying to ""force"" any of these ideas. The thing people forget, is that our current versions of being truthful to ourselves, is often just something that has spawned over years of habit building in the way we think and act and speak. The idea that if we feel negatively we should just embrace it, is to an extend flawed because the very reason we see something negatively might come from habits, rather than an actually unbiased personal view. Our mindsets are shaped and molded throughout our lives, and just sticking with what feels natural right now, does not mean you are being truthful or honest to yourself. It just means you are acting on your basic habits, and putting a blind eye towards any potential changes or betterments in how you think and act - not better for others, but for yourself.
This video is solely about how you become better at conveying important messages in a way that makes people listen. If you don't want to improve so that people listen in the first place, then stop complaining about never being heard. If you truly want people to care about your words and thoughts, then you have to break down your habits and build different ones that better suit your goal. We always have the option to evolve our minds, most people just embrace the status quo sooner or later and act like ""this is who they are"", when in reality they haven even explored a fraction of who they could be."

1,"We have been doing interviews and learning about video and podcast the last month and this video fits right in with both of those types of media.

I sure would not dive into a debate about Honesty and Authenticity as that can bring out the worst in people. ;-}

However the pitch and pace seem to be 2 things I really notice in a podcast or a video. If the pitch is to high, it can irritating and if the pace is to slow, I might get bored. You however may see/hear things differently. Maybe you like the slow talkers or don't mind the higher pitches.

I wonder if these 2 things could have anything to do with how we are raised? Where we come from and the people we were around could influence what voices we are drawn to?

0,Are these Actual sins? Like sins of the bible
1,"Why not base what you have to say one whether you have anything important to say, rather than finding tricks for how to get people to listen and not ignore you.

You can scream fire, and people will pay attention, or you can insult people, like as happens her on the Internet all the time, and people do pay attention because they need to key off something to insult the speaker back ... but is any of that productive?

This is like advertising ... getting people to pay attention by putting a pretty scantily clad woman in the picture ... so if you want to give a great TED talk just have a women in a bikini groveling at your feet or something.

We base too many of our actions on tricks, because we all know human beings, people, are just stupid and animalistic ... so instead what we should do as a society is attempt to support the most human parts of human beings and evolve into the thing we think we are now, civilized.

It's like this TED talk ... all TED talks ... the produce a brand so people will watch, and then they start to fill it with mediocrity and pointlessness.  The thing is, yes, I could be wrong, it could be just my opinion that this is pointless and mediocre ... but OK, I'll cop to that, sorry Julian, I think your video is just so you can say you did a TED talk, maybe for toastmasters or something, well presented in all the points of talking, but I did not like it because I don't think you said anything with saying that isn't in a 100 other places and truthfully, rather dubious."

1,"JT's delivered what I'd call a ""topology of sustained oratorical engagement"". Choosing TED to deliver his message, Julian invokes quines of computer science. The topology is used to deliver the topology, just as quines write & compile their own source code. 

Treasure rapped out each concept with balance, gradually revealing their roles in a holistic framework, one that left little room for misconception. The only change I'd make? A pinch of intellectual detail & spiritual robustness, sprinkled on like salt-n-pepper. The balance of that versus clarity/conciseness was off a smidge."

Because he has turned God given expression and converted into a craft or form of technical yet lovable skill. 
I beg you to realize the difference in his pretentious playfulness and making declarations of exceptionalism that can only come your piece of Heaven. 

We have all heard someone say "" thank you from the bottom of my heart"" raise your aim. Never let your mind control your expression thank others with conviction from the very center of your heart. 
It becomes an angelic choir of raw naked truth. Encompassed with all that is real. You will no longer be misunderstood. You cannot argue absolution. His toolbox is fantastic in the world of comerce and accetability. 

You need not seek acceptance. You.  Each of you are exceptional by default virtue as a direct aspect of your creator. 

Your voice is made perfect when you never have to think of what you were going to say. You need only to remember and be thankful for all to all. Forgive me if it seems i am casting a shadow on this mans work. It is not my intent. 

My comment is to organically awaken your power. Make declarations not suggestions. Fear no form of rejection. Every breath is a gift every word spoke when from your heavenly hate has the power of creation equally it can shatter worlds. You need no instruction manual. You know this. 
Safe and easy voids fulfillment. Please be careful when wielding such power.  Remember the key is absolution. Grace and truth. All else is simply the plate which your message sits upon. 

As often as you can , cry and laugh at the same time and hear yourself say thank you. To the open air. It will get where its supposed too. 

I mean no harm. I normally woukdnt jump in, but had to say someting. Haha. See what i did there. 

With love.

1,"I think there is something to be said for waiting for the person you are speaking with to be READY to listen.  Dont approach them if they are busy or distracted.  Ask, ""is now a good time to talk?"" if you arent certain.  Wait for them to be done texting, and put their phone away.  Ask them to turn off the TV.  And vice versa for listeners-dont be rude!  Listen when someone is talking!  Dont allow distractions to interfere.  When someone comes to speak to me, I close my laptop and look at them while they speak.  Or I turn off the TV.  And if i am distracted for some reason (they come to talk while I am in the middle of writing a letter for example), I let them know, now isnt a good time.  Or I may say ""hold on one second"", if I just need to finish typing a thought."

1,"Literally, this video is very beneficial . I got useful advice"
1,"My thoughts on this talk:

Short Analysis:

My general impression of this guy is that he's a language purist and wants people to go back to speaking in the way his generation spoke - so really, he's falling prey to his own form of dogmatism. Sadly for him, language will keep on evolving as newer generations are born, so those of us who are older have to either adapt or become irrelevant. I've had to listen to the older generation bitching about ""Awesome"" since my generation (Generation X) popularized it, and that argument was old 20 years ago.

Also, he talks about being yourself, being honest and authentic, but suggests people with undesirable voices go to a voice coach. 

Long Analysis:

1. Gossip - though I agree with this one in principle, sometimes gossip is helpful IF it's based on truth and evidence. I've found out about disloyal friends, two-faced coworkers and untrustworthy family members through gossip, so though it can be toxic, like everything else it can be useful.

2. Judging - If we didn't judge situations and people, we wouldn't have survived as a species. Judging helps us to discern a situation, and though we don't always hit the mark due to personal biases, judging people and situations are essential to our survival.

3. Negativity - This one always bothers me, because it tells people what they should and shouldn't say. I don't like the idea of ""speech police"" forcing a false positivity upon everyone in the case where there's a valid negative situation that needs changing. If we as a species never complained about a bad situation and simply ""stayed positive"" about everything in Western society, we'd still have slavery, there would be no gender equality, the Civil Rights Movement would never have happened, it would still be okay to abuse children and marry minors, etc. 

4. Complaining - People who don't like ""complainers"" usually see things in the same way, but they're too cowardly to do anything about it (""If I do something about this, I might lose my job! Better maintain the status quo!""), so again, they try to impose a false positivity on a situation in order to make it tolerable. People who complain about things that are bad help to bring about change in the world.

5. Excuses - Agreed, I know people like this and they drive me nuts, though there are situations where people get accused of ""making excuses"" and it's actually a valid reason (ie: being late due to heavy traffic as a result of a car accident). Sometimes something else IS to blame, and to look at this in a black-and-white context is to be, well, dogmatic. ;)

6. Exaggeration/""Lying"" - Exaggeration doesn't demean our language, nor is it ""lying."" Treasure says people don't want to listen to people who are ""lying,"" but the fact that we as a culture love listening to comedians (humour is based upon exaggeration) contradicts his theory. We often tell people who don't look nice that they look ""great,"" because to tell them the truth is demoralizing and cruel. Lying isn't always a bad thing.

7. Dogmatism - I agree with him on this one - the internet is full of dogmatic people. Unfortunately, his speech is highly dogmatic, telling people how to speak and colouring various ways of speaking as negative. "

1,There seem to be a few habits that are restricted to certain cultured. Like “exaggeration”: In Switzerland something really good will be labeled as “not bad” and so on. They actually tend to do the opposite of exaggeration - which can be dull at times. While Americans label everything that is remotely okay as at least “awesome” - really enthusiastic but difficult to take anything serious from a person like that.

1,"I was a speech & debate champion in HS & college (Harvard) and then a debate and speech coach at the HS and college levels for more than 30 years, as well as a founder of urban speech and debate.  Everything Julian Treasure says here is exactly what high school speech teachers try to convey to their students each and every day; policy debaters try to persuade by facts and logic, whereas events like oratory involve rhetorical methods (some of which are mentioned in the talk) for persuasion.  These essentially are known to us as LOGOS and ETHOS; the best speakers can not only control register, timbre, prosody, pace, silence, pitch and volume, but also can start a speech with a hook, an introduction, a topic sentence, 2-3 arguments, surrounded by rhetorical flourishes (three words starting with the same consonant is a famous one) a conclusion and a closing hook.

However, when you are in a classroom with a lot of students, some of them get lost or star to doing another stuff. They are not even listen to you or trying to do so.

About the 7 sins and 4 foundations, I'm not so sure. I believe it's more a matter of balancing all those things, because they're not necessarily opposite but actually related in some cases. For instance, in the way he described, Authority + Love could easily lead to be dogmatic.

But it's something that worth to listen and think about."

1,"My daughter speaks so quietly to her children 12/16 years old that they have become excellent listeners. She looks at them intently - when they are not listening she will follow her words with silence. I then hear this from my grandchildren- What! I am listening. My daughter says - What did you hear? (I love that because she uses silence when she sees a puzzled look- a look of disagreement- a look of frustration)
She guides the conversation until she is understood then she says - Come and see me when ... is done. My grandchildren know this means when ... is done - it will be there turn to speak and be understood. I love to be at their house. It has the sweetest atmosphere."
1,"This is interesting. I was always the one who people don't listen quite carefully, but not in a negative way, just... ""you are not interesting enough at this very moment"". I mean, even the closest family and friends who really love me and who I really love.

Now, I don't gossip, judge or lie, but when I saw this list of ""important"" things, I do tend to display light cases of negativity, complaining, and dogmatising.
I tend to start the conversation with the ""jerk who cut me off in the traffic"", or ""did you hear about that murder case yesterday"".

Also, I don't think about the register, pitch or volume, although people often don't understand me, even though I'm not mumbling and I try to speak ""clear"".

This video is quite helpful, it addresses the things I wasn't paying attention to.

One ""sin"" is missing in the list  (which I tend to practice sometimes as well) - repeating yourself, over and over. You make the listener bored, and you show him/her, since you forgot yoy've already said something, that you don't really care about your conversations."

1,"There are many situations where when talking other people don't listen.  why is that?
 How do you speak to make a difference in the world?
 there are some ways we have to leave
 assambled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking.  There are 7 habits that are quite large

 first : gossip
 badmouthing people behind their back is not a good habit.  people who will gossip will certainly gossip about us
 second: judging
 If we have been judged by people, then we will judge others too
 third: negativity
 for example someone said sucks, today is monday
 fourth: complaining
 a lot of people complain about the weather, assignments, college, whatever. Complaining is endless suffering
 fifth: excuses
 I think some of us or ourselves have thrown the blame, and are not responsible for their actions.
 sixth : lying
 sometimes when we see what is really awesome and exaggerate it becomes a lie
  the last one: dogmatism
 mix facts with opinion.  When someone chides you with their opinion as if it's true, it's very hard to hear.

 Hail
 to greet or acclaim enthusiastically
 h is honesty.  be clear and straight
 a is authenticity.  just be yourself
 i is integrity.  be your word
 l is love.  wish them well

 There are several values ​​that other people feel when we speak including: register, timbre, prosody, pace, pitch, volume."
0,You're already wrong
1,So he started conversation with negatively!
1,"i believe it is extremely important to have people understand exactly what you mean when you are speaking to them. sometimes the way you say something completely changes the way a person perceives the meaning. a good example of this, is texting. how many times have we had someone take what we say the wrong way by just texting vs speaking?"
1,Fantastic Julian Treasure. I really enjoyed your explanation.
1,"Unfortunately the point about fact vs opinion seems to be getting harder and harder to work inside of. I picked up on that gem a long time ago but it seems like with each passing day more people are accepting their own opinion as fact and not allowing anything to prove otherwise. It's hard to use honesty and factuality to drive a point across when the other person is discounting hard known fact because their own silly opinion. I've taken to making visual aids when possible to leave less room for discounting fact but even that seems to have very limited results. For example wasting resources because they look spread out, so collect them up and place them in a measuring container of some sort. Just tried this the other night and sure it drew in attention, everyone had a ""holy crap"" moment but yet here I am today, a day later and it has resulted in no change and the same dead ears to pointing out that it's unnecessary waste easily countered by a couple minutes of sorting every hour or two."

1,"Honestly people always do that to me online why who knows but clearly isn't nice. 

Those who don't like me do all these things yet. There the excuses people make. Yet there a guy i know who always complaining does like the way he looks yet does nothing to Change it. It tell me that guy does care about himself or his heath or his goals but does nothing about so what he do complain to his online friends make excuse lies about things when his scared the reason why his negative is because his not happy with himself. 
Happiness comes from within if he can make himself  happy then how can any woman.
I won't put up with any negativity of others have, just because there unhappy with there self. If they don't like themselves think if they could change something about themselves what would it be and why.....then make a committed goal and do that positive goal."

But first hit your throat, Mnmn Mnmm... 

•••Men speak with a little base in it, avoid speaking to fast. 

•••Ladies speak calmly men automatically like that. 

Avoid, Eh, ehm, etc in the middle of your speech. 

Just pause and continue with the next word,then everyone in the  audience will automatically see you as an intelligent person subconsciously.

It's a human trick."
1,"Eight, the acting out of anger thing, is true, BUT you've had worse excuses to harass me and my friends, such as ""I deserve it"", ""you're mad"",(just like I said about them) and you've even admitted to going over the top. past two day, you've joined me in game with a friend/family member that you've probably told false things about me, or it could just be you as a alt, and judging on how he/she was attacking us, he/she had no idea what was going on, and what you did."
1,"I'm an acting teacher and a voice teacher. I coach on movies, theatre and radio...and while this man has some valid points about ""listening"", and the need to improve speech in general: however, his idea of how a person should sound is dangerous, hegemonic, vain, pretentious, white male perspective of a chest based voice.

I'm a voice instructor by profession and one of my pet peeves is when someone in a teaching video says something like ""well done!"" to a person  on the other side of the video that they didn't hear. Similarly at : ""Beautiful! You're getting really good at this."" I understand Mr. Treasure means to be encouraging, but it's nonetheless insincere. Otherwise, thank you for some concise and valuable advice."

1,Who came here from Gujarat Board's english textbook?
1,"These are some excellent tips, but ultimately the root of the problem lies with peoples' inability to listen. We should train ourselves how to listen, before learning how to speak. In a room full of people,  I've managed to be the person everyone wants to talk to because I have trained myself how to listen, with enthusiasm, and adjust my reactions accordingly to make the speaker feel confident and comfortable."
1,"I agree with this video mostly, but a conversation, and on a bigger level, our species cant progress with some negatitivity, judgemnt complaints and several other things that make people listen less. Which is quite a predicament, because to change things, on must be heard, but to be heard you must make people want to hear you. But, once they have heard you, to change anything, you must complain, judge, and be negative to an extent. Which leads people away. Then you need to get peoples attention. As you can see, this continues and causes quite some problems. The only solution is to not just label certain things as generally and always bad, like judgment, negativity, complaints, and the like."

1,Very useful for me because I am not able to speak effectively
1,"Communication is about human connection. Being able to communicate effectively is one of the best life habits. Good listening is among the most important principles of great communication. It is common for most people to listen not with the intent of understanding, but with the intent of replying. Listening with the intent to understand is to fully understand that person intellectually and emotionally. You ensure that you understand by repeating back to them what they said and mirroring their emotions. By doing so, you help them structure their own thoughts and feelings. This type of listening can lead to truly open and trusting communication."

1,"""How to speak so people want to listen"".Speak the sweet little lies that they want to hear .On average, If people don't want to hear some information that is contrary to their agendas ( beliefs, deeply held opinions etc)  then they won't hear it ( think about it). 

E.g.Many  people will not hear and then think about information regarding the evidence on evolution or climate change or human caused mass extinction or pollution. They will only hear what they want to hear and that leads to social "" echo chambers"" with groups of people whom don't challenge/ question their beliefs.Whatever you say & however you say it they will only hear ( think) what they want to hear and or what they are capable of comprehending ( e.g. A one month old baby can not hear your ideas on quantum mechanics only the sounds). Those that are open to thinking differently, already are open to thinking differently & listenning to new information about any particular subject. Science is continually building it's knowledge and that's why , in general, scientists are more open to new evidenced based idea's/words.Even when that evidence contradicts their general understanding of any particular topic. 
E.g. The average psychology ( stone age) would not understand why many scientists would be thrilled if they were proved wrong about some subjects due to the general evidence base. E.g. Convincing proof that a after life exists. However, there is convincing proof that a "" after life"" is a contradiction in terms.As death is being not alive and what people perceive as ""l"" is them being alive and conscious of their life."

(largely) ...and you can throw in a few things of your own, so long as they're passionate about the gist of your whole message...  people always hear what they want to hear anyway...   Doesn't anyone else find it odd, that white nationalist fascists HATE jews, but trump defends and sides with jews, and they don't seem to mind...??? Yeah...  like i said...  if you give 'em  *MOST* of the stuff that they want to hear, they'll take some ""other stuff"" with it...  and most likely ignore it, or rationalize it away, with some inconsequent reasoning.."

1,"My experience is that most say they want honesty, but you then realize that it's only true if it aligns with their opinions."
2,Having a British accent helps.
1,"Obviously, Mr. Treasure teaches public speaking and is proficient in the mechanics of speech, as he demonstrates here.  But for most people, the mechanics are only part of the difficulty in speaking publicly.  Stage fright is the other.  Getting up in front of a group, however small, is intimidating for most of us.  


The only way to get over the fear of public speaking is to do it, beginning with small gatherings and working up to stage performances.  Thinking of the audience as individuals and speaking to them as such seems to work for me.  I hate to perform.  Instead, I prefer to engage or discuss with people, even when addressing an audience of thousands.  Every speaker develops his or her own technique for getting cozy with an audience.  But keeping things human eliminates the artificial barrier fearful speakers erect between themselves and the audience.


The British educational system seems far better at teaching ordinary students to speak before a group.  Some are better than others, but all graduates of British schools seem quite comfortable expressing their opinions and even arguing with those who disagree, defending their views with elan.  Compare them with the American college students of today who are protected from ideas they might find upsetting or offensive.  Poor little dears.  They are already far behind the Brits."

2,That was a great presentation- thank you!
2,Shave your head like him.
1,"Speaking is a two way communication system.  Their reaction to your words should be impactful enough to cause a response by those listening!!  Although virtual, a common live action response by ""mobs"" of people , will have a ""believed in"", positive virtual mob mentality  efffect.  Groovism is the belief system that is prepared to broadcast The One.  www.groovism.org is currently broadcasting various Grooves  on YouTube,  soon to be streaming 24/7 from around the world!"

1,Is this useful for youtubr or should you speak like Mr. Beast?
1,"Excellent presentation. I also enjoyed your R4 programme on ""The curse of the open plan office"". It intrigued (but not surprised) me to learn that first and foremost, archictects want the building to ""look nice"" at the expense of just about everything else. Another good example of this is fire hazard in buildings - something the architects had to be brought kicking and screaming to acknowledge with a background of increasing fire deaths and injuries in the latter half of the 20th century due to poor choice of metrieals and esgin from a fire and smoke spread aspect. Looks as theough they are now tasked with the changes due on acoustics!"

1,"Well, sure it could sound nice to have a world like he described but I think that, in the process, you lose a way to identify one's personality based on how they speak. There are many ways to speak that can tell if someone is insecure, shy, overly extrovert, seeking for attention and many more. If you change the world so that everyone speaks consciously, I think you erase this part, I think you lose authenticity."

1,"Sorry I stopped listening as soon as he said ""the human voice""."
1,"I just had an idea. Classrooms, why do we all get so tired sitting in them. I mean sometimes we get a really good teacher with a really interesting subject. What if it was so that the classrooms we are sitting in are terribly shaped. The atmosphere is often dreadful. Take a classical bar for instance, it tend to feel cozy with warmth and heart put into it. It feels welcoming like you are home. The classrooms are usually cold places, with excessive left over spaces, like those sharp corners in the ceiling. What if we sound proofed the room with a mindset of a recording studio, damping down the reverb and made the room focused on one place. The teachers podium. Have it conduct a natural reverb and exclude every excessive background noise, what would we get? A place that works with the audience and the speaker, a place where we can digest the columnhigh information we recieve, etc. I believe in that we need to create a dynamic enviroment, like in a concert hall or aula where the best dynamic can be recieved for the best cause from the best output."

1,"If these types of interpersonal skills along with mindfulness meditation were taught in schools, we would live in a much more sane world. Intelligence isn't just about memorizing facts."
1,"I speak softly... and that isn't ever going to change. However, I think I'm quite alright with my ability to converse with people. Its a very good watch though nonetheless.. thank you Mr Treasure."

1,How to speak so that people don't have to listen to you.
1,"Don`t warm up in the toilett booth inside the building you`re having a job interview, they can hear you!"
1,"The one thing that stood out to me is that Julian starts off by saying, “The human voice is an instrument we all play it’s the most powerful sound in the world.” That is crazy to me because it is true. I never really thought about how powerful someone voice is. A strong voice can dictate our next mayor or president. A strong voice in the court room can determine if a person goes to jail or not. Julian say that there are seven bad habits people do when coming to speaking. The first one is gossiping, speaking bad about a person when they are not present. Next is judging prejudging a person before you actually get to know them, it is hard for a person to listen to someone who is judging them, it is hard for a person to listen to someone who is judging them. Third is negativity, being negative can bring someone else down. Fourth is complaining, Julian states that complaining is viral misery. Fifth is excuse listening to someone who does not take blame for there action. The sixth is over exaggerating. I personally can not listen to someone who over exaggerating about something. Personally if someone is over exaggerating it is annoying and hard to listen to someone. The seventh and final one is dogmatism. Dogmatism is laying down principles without the consideration of others opinions. Those are the seven deadly sins of speaking. Julian believes that there are four powerful words that will make us speak powerful and can change the world. Honesty just be clear and straight, authenticity be yourself, integrity be your word, and last love wish them well. The speaking skills that was stated in this video should be taught in high school all over the world. I think that If everyone would know these steps to make there speak powerful I can only image how much better our world would be."
1,"His speech has content and is not boring. Plus his language is clear regardless of accent. Who cares about accent, the message was delivered thats it..."
1,"I can definitively say as an autistic person, that not a single Neuro typical person wants to hear honesty especially honesty that comes from you wanting to preserve your integrity, and I definitely don’t want to hear your authentic self. They don’t wanna hear it from other Nuro typical people and they definitely don’t want to hear it from autistic people. Those three things will get them to stop listening quicker than all seven of the other things being done at the same time because they are just listening enough to know when it’s their turn to talk."
2,Great Vid  Can't Wait For The Other
1,Ironically Trump is guilty of all these things and everyone listens.

1,Nobody can beat Obama on effective speaking.
1,"Interesting to watch someone like John Oliver on Last Week Tonight break many of the rules that Julian presents here and gets away with it. The first four points seem to be the basis of standup comedy, which is doing rather well."
1,"Not sure about authenticity.  My version of this is meaning what I say, no hidden agendas, no secret meanings.  Yet people sometimes think there must be something else.  I can't be my straightforward self, and I'm not using that as a cover for being mean the way some people say something mean and then say ""I was only joking"".  People dont want straightforward  and truthful.  I find that people are often difficult enough that you have to pussyfoot around them.  Or I have to, anyway."

1,"Rumi said one should care about three things before speaking 
1. What we say should be necesssry
2. It should be true 
3. It shouldn't hurt somebody 
If these things are not being met then it's better to stay silent because again Rumi said "" silence is the language of God!"""
2,Just great. 
1,"A commenter here made the point that complaining helps bring problems to light. I wish this person could make that point without assigning derogatory labels and adopting such a nasty tone. I think that gossip served a useful purpose in small-scale tribal societies in that information was more likely to spread throughout the society when there was an impulse among some members to talk, talk, talk... about anything and everything. Even (perhaps especially) about the foibles of the neighbors and cousins... But just because a trait was selected for in ages past does not mean we need to pander to those tendencies. We also evolved to be drawn to sweet things. Now that trait within us can cause problems. We should not indulge our taste for sweetness as much as our natural affinity might lead us to do. A measure of constraint is needed now.

I want to communicate clearly and effectively in order to better share some ideas that would mean an end to extreme poverty AND a limit on humans' impacts on the environment...  A sustainable and more just civilization:

1,I was feeling board while listening hime
1,Great examples that R sooo true. To understand just start to listen to others rather than thinking about what your going to say stop and take a moment.
1,Wow...such vivid imagination....i believe people and i meet each person still living has an amazing power from within. This tends to lie dormant for most people who sadly never get the chance to experience their own personal greatness. It's from my own personal experience that the speech and choice of words that one person spits out from their mouth which is controlled by only them. This is directly related to how he/she feels about themselves on the inside.

1,I have great appreciate for Julian Treasure's Talk. I have in the past found myself responding to a question asked and then suddenly get the sense  that the person was not listening. Love the translation of HAIL. I find the talk quite instructive.
1,"Come on ... we have to be so mindlessly positive that You-Tube and most Internet chat boards only have LIKE buttons ... and they do not even let you know how many LIKED something out of a the total who look at it?

Something is trying to program us and silence our opinions ... we just seem to want to be sold all of this stuff, but in our great Western democracies, if we cannot just expresss our collective agreement or disagreement on a simple thing like a video, what do you really think a Presidential election gets us?"

1,Authenticity - Pee yourself
1,The speaker voice is so influential and calm to listen. My greatest voice mentor ever.
1,"What's the problem in being positive? He is not saying to go around in a state of delusion by agreeing and condoning what evil people do with your smiles and love. On the contrary, if you truly love humanity (or desire to learn to love others unconditionally), you would, out of sheer love for your neighbor, use your best will and efforts to protect your fellow brothers and sisters from harmful evil people by fighting it in a peaceful way. For example, Gandhi loved all, unconditionally. He even loved the intruders of his country, as they were his fellow human beings. He did not condone what they did though. He vehemently disagreed and used his willpower and vowed to fight that evil in a peaceful, loving way. What was the result? He changed the course of history, helped free his country from oppression, and gave us a beautiful example of how to both love others unconditionally and use that love to fight for what we know is right."
1,"The voice is really a powerful instrument, it is always good to learn and review a little more about communication and vocal techniques. Although the speech of the video is well systematized and easy to understand, the systematization also caused me a little monotony, but the examples were great and broke this mood, were the best part as well as the vocal exercise with the audience, I confess that I followed from home. Finally, I propagate your conviction that the idea of ​​understanding deserves to be spread."

1,"In terms of moral and ethical principles, I find it commendable that a speech should spread the highest human values, however, unfortunately and much to my regret, experience shows us that it is endearingly naive to think that honesty, justice and good intentions even have something to do with the ability to catch and convince an audience of the ideas that are exposed. That mentality is sadly preschool. The reality is totally the opposite and therefore much more savage: we are a flock of sheep that let ourselves be guided by wolves dressed in sheep's clothing. Let me explain, there is a basic teaching in the performing arts that preaches the following: the public hardly identifies with an interpretation that is real, reality is often bland and boring. If you really want to catch and move the public, the interpretation must be ""REALISTIC"" that is, more than ""being real"", ""seem real"". This is the principle of histrionics, which not only actors know how to apply but also ""opinion leaders"" whether they are politicians, religious, businessmen or even simple charlatans. This rabble without any scruples, is capable of lying, swindling, scamming or deceiving without their pulse trembling and even without blinking, using with unparalleled mastery at the right times and with the precise dosage, a wide and affable smile or perhaps a stern and circumspect look or perhaps a deep and charming looking that conveys seriousness and confidence.
In short: the talk seemed too perfect... For a perfect world, which is not ours..."

Script:
The human voice, it's the instrument we all play it's the most powerful sound in the world probably, it's the only one that can start a war or say I love you, and yet many people have experienced that when they speak, people don't listen to them and why is that. How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world? What I'd like to suggest there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for ur pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking, im not pretending this is an exhaustive list but these seven I think are pretty large habit that we can all fall into
First, gossip. Speaking I'll of somebody who is not present not a nice habit, and we know perfectly well the person gossiping, five minutes later, will be gossiping about us. Second, judging we know people who are like this in conversationand and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time. Third, negativity, you can fall into this. My mother, in the last years of her life, became very very negative and it's hard to listen I remember one day I said to her, it's October 1 today, and she said, I know isn't it dreadful? It's hard to listen when somebody is that negative. And another form of negative is complaining. Well, this is the national art of the UK. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather, sport, about politics, about everything, but actually complaining is vital misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world. Excuses we've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blame thrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions and again, hard to listen to somebody who is being like that. Penultimate, the sixth of the seven, embroidery, exaggeration, it demeans our language, actually, sometimes. For example if I see something that really is awesome. What do I call it? And then, of course, this exaggeration becomes lying alternate lying and we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us. And finally,dogmatism the confusion of facts and opinions, when those 2 things get conflated, you're listening into the wind. You know. Somebody is bombarding u with their opinions as if they were true, it's difficult to listen to that"

1,here to practicing my english loudly_crying_face
1,"After seeing the video, my opinion is that I am very much at the same time as the video. because if we want to be listened to while speaking, we must avoid things that make people lazy to listen. Such as gossip, judging, negativity, complaining, excuses, lying, and, dogmatism. Some of the factors that make us to be heard when speaking are register, timbre, prosody, pace, pitch and volume. We can implement this when speaking in public, because if we speak undone by others we will feel upset and disrespected. But also keep in mind that if we want to be heard by others, we must also be willing to listen to others."

1,"Unfortunately all the things he mentions - complaining, gossip etc. are exactly what people DO like to engage in. They WILL listen to you if you talk like that. In my experience you are less likely to be heard in a rowdy group if you are humble. BUT THAT'S OK. What's important is not to worry about whether you are fitting in with the group. Don't engage in negativity or cynicism because its not good for YOU; it has nothing to do with getting people to listen to you."

2,"7 deadly sins are totally true that ruin our life. However, I am pretty sure that some people love to gossip, judge and complain to spread negativity among people. They enjoy the tensionneutral_face"
1,This is quite definitive.and it makes all the difference!
1,"""Absolute honesty may not be what we want"" I can see a clear coincidence with a concept treated in the movie Interstellar :3
90% Honesty setting on the robot TARS, because ""absolute honesty isn't always the most diplomatic, not the safest for of communication with emotional beings."" That is.
I googled the 90% honesty parameter and what came up was that for someone, 90% honesty means 10% dishonesty. Which isn't true, not definitely. 10% might as well be used for empathy, which is the concept I would get. Not because being 90% and not 100 means I have a bit of leeway to manipulate people. But because I have a bit of leeway to convey a message THAT IS TRUE, but in a way that won't hurt that person, which is generally the consequence when being 100% honesty, that translates in being blunt, rude"

1,"For me, I like the _linguistic_ definition of the word ""register"": It has to do with word choices that fit a context. It's the difference in word/idiom choices between talking to a buddy on the street vs. talking to your doctor vs. talking to groups of people in formal settings.

I'm sensitive about this because I have a personal experience with it. As a kid, I spent a lot of time reading. It took a bit long for me to figure out that people looked at me weird because I was talking to them like an author reading bookish prose. I'm curious how many people might could learn to better communicate by reflecting on whether their spoken words choices fit the social environment."

I've always thought about how I could say that when I saw her, but this lecture made me realize that.I think my problem is that I use umm...eh... a lot in the middle of talking. Now that I think about it, I used it a lot because I was embarrassed if I didn't speak while I was speaking, but I thought that not speaking could be a way. Also, there were a few habits that people in front of the lecture do that I could relate to. I thought it was meaningless, but I thought it might have removed my speaking habits or the power of words. Also, I often hear from people around me that I speak fast, and I looked back on whether the habit also failed to express exactly what I wanted to say or communicate. I will try to fix bad habits one by one from what I can do."

Molan, I can show that you are brainwashed: Do you (your political party) prefer freedom, or gov't involvement in your personal business?

A right winger like you would say you prefer ""FREEDOM"".   Why don't you think YOU are brainwashed a little bit?  Why do you care about those unimportant silly topics, instead of the deficit, spending half of tax money on foreign wars, gov't secrecy and corruption?  Get it? There are big concerns that actually matter to YOU personally. The things you mentioned don't.  Most the things you mentioned are none-of-your business, in the LAND OF THE FREE, you are free to manage your own border, identity and image, family/relationship, morals.   Aren't republicans supposed to believe in small gov't?

So, so Mr. Molan Lane, you have you been brainwashed to support America or to have a certain opinion on silly unimportant topics that don't actually concern you?

(This guy Molan's post is indistinguishable from a bot posting disinformation to brainwash people and manipulate public opinion, with a generic tangential persuasive post.)"

1,Very helpful. Even as a former Toastmaster this was insightful information.
1,"Has anybody ever thought that most of human conversations are based on the seven sins he talked about? People are able to share their feelings through complaining and negativity. Allowing them to establish rapport and finally create some sort of bond. People need to know that they're not alone. Not to mention the fact that most  people with mental health issues such as depression don't share their problems and negativity, leaving them feeling a sense of isolation. Like the seven human sins, all the ""sins"" he mentioned are what makes up our everyday conversations and are necessary. The world he envisions would be a monotone world where praise becomes a language and everybody completely hide or lie about all their own personal problems which may not be fake, doing so contradicts his ""sins"". Thus concluding that, although Mr. Treasure does present an reality which sounds good in theory, it would simply not work. Making his ideals a reality would mean that we would have to change human nature."

This guy is a cretin.  I am reminded about a book by Barbara Ehrenriech where she talks about how when they hire people they hire those who are likely to be sort of robotic ... that is, mindlessly positive.

Sure, it's great to get along and make others comfortable and happy, but the larger context in the world today is massive corruption and inequality, and forcing people to put on a smile and not say anything negative or criticize people just enables things to stay the same or get worse."

I’ve spent most of my teens and twenties looking for *the* social anxiety cure, if such a thing actually existed. After a 10+ year search (& plenty of snake oil salesmen), I stumbled over the psychological equivalent of the holy grail: EFT & Sebastiaan’s EFT-based Social Confidence System. I’ve made more headway in a few months using the SCS than the previous 10+ years of talk therapy, cog-behavioral therapy, hypnosis & affirmations combined. Seriously. This s–t works.

Isn't that like telling people how to fake it, how to con people, how to convince people without taking care of the idea, but about how to present yourself in a very convincing manner... and doing something that really makes you look stupid... in order to get people to convince idiots?

You cannot be convinced by just sounds or posture, can you? Isn't it like you have to present actual ideas?

Whenever someone presents ideas like this I feel like his motivation is to teach liers. The more elaborate the liers, the more elaborate people will learn to detect those."

1,"Now I understand why it is one of the most watched ted talks, despite being interesting it also is very easy to listen to as the speaker is speaking very fluently. He is speaking about characteristics of a “good” speech and shows it to us with his own example. I liked it simple yet informative delivery. I deem that becoming a good speaker and why not even a listener one should put a lot effort in it because nothing comes out of blue. People are so enthralled with the thrill of speaking that they lose sight that listening is a much more powerful business tool than speaking. I loved to the statement “the thrill of speaking” because it highlights once again how people are inclined to speaking rather than listening. If the vice verse was true we would have much more As in different curses than we have now. In his TED talk, Julian advises people to remember the word ""hail.” which stands for  

Honesty. (is being true in what you say, being straight and clear)

Authenticity. (just being yourself)

Integrity. (being your word, actually doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust.)

Love. (in the sense of wishing people well.)

Although the title is talking so that people will listen to you, I find the advantages of becoming a skilled listener more interesting. Therefore I highly advise everyone to listen to this talk and develop skills in order to increase their effectiveness, performance and productivity, raise their well-being and build stronger more secure relationships."

7 Deadly Sins of Speaking

1. gossip
2. judgement
3. negativity
4. complaining
5. excuses
6. lying
7. dogmatism

cornerstones for powerful speech and change:

HAIL - to greet or acclaim enthusiastically

Honesty
Authenticity
Integrity
Love

register: how you speak comes from the chest (lower voices)

timbre: how your voice feels (rich, smooth)

prosody: monotone comes from prosody

pace: slow down and emphasize

silence: don't feel like you have to fill the space

pitch: level can emphasize

volume: loud or quiet; dynamics create the interest

Look at your tool box for how you speak.

6 Vocal Exercises:

1. deep breathe and exhale
2. Ba Ba Ba
3. BBBBBBBB
4. La La La La La
5. RRRRRRRRRR (champagne for the tongue)
6. WeeeaaaaaHHHHHH


What would happen if we were to speak powerfully to people who were consciously listening in environments which were fit for purpose (designed landscapes)?

What would happen if we were producing sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound?

It would be a world that does sound beautiful and a world where understanding would be the norm."

1,"33. And who is better in speech than he who [says: “My Lord is Allah (believes in His Oneness),” and then stands straight (acts upon His Order), and] invites (men) to Allah’s (Islamic Monotheism), and does righteous deeds, and says: “I am one of the Muslims.”

34. The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better (i.e. Allah ordered the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly), then verily! he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend.

35. But none is granted it (the above quality) except those who are patient, and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of the happiness in the Hereafter i.e. Paradise and in this world of a high moral character). (Q.S. 41 : 33-35)"

1,"*Summary (type:medium)*
The human voice is the most powerful sound in the world, probably. But many people have the experience that when they speak, people don't listen to them. Here are seven habits that we need to move away from, including gossip, complaining and judging others. The sixth of the seven is exaggeration, which demeans our language. There are four powerful cornerstones, foundations, that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world. The H, H, honesty, of course, is being true in what you say, being straight and clear. The A is authenticity, just being yourself. The L is love. And finally, dogmatism. We vote for politicians with lower voices, it's true, because we associate depth with power and authority. There are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture, with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice. Prosody is the sing-song, the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning. I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do. I can get very excited by saying something really quickly, or I can slow right down to emphasize, and at the end of that, of course, silence is our old friend. We speak not very well to people who simply aren't listening, he says. We need to design all our environmentsconsciously for sound, he argues. ""That would be a world that does sound beautiful,"" he adds. ""And that is an idea worth spreading"""

How to speak so that people want to listen"
2,I like your clips
1,"I'm sorry for your loss!
What did I loose?
Your eyebrows."
1,Prakhar ke Pravachan copied his book title from here face_with_tears_of_joy
1,"I would like to extend my personal thanks to the cameramen for recording the audience looking ridiculous and to the editors for putting those clips in the final product.  Made my day watching an entire huge audience making themselves look stupid with funny noises and facial expressions at the direction of someone on stage doing the same.
On a related note, it says a lot about just how good of a speaker he is.  Not everyone is persuasive and charismatic enough to convince that many people to go ""La la la la la la pthpthpthpthpth,"" in perfect unison."
1,"The sins seem to encapsule Trump's entire campaign, and can we say he hasn't been listened to?"
1,"Mediocre mind talk about people,average about events and brilliant about Ideas!"
1,Speaking in the way that people do not want to reject me is not hard though it is not easy.
1,Yay I complain about getting electricity in my house 22 hours a day and still get a very fine.fukit syria stop fukin
1,A lot of people I talk with have a hard time listening to me due to the truth & straight to the point of manner I speak in & I've notice how I get angry when others don't do the same.
1,"I loved his speech""he made it so fun 2speak with love&respect always""&how if everyone does this it can become the norm again in Society""It helped me 2realize that just because my faith in Jesus&his word always taught me2 be encouraging everywhere I go""but there are many people in the world that have 2taught how 2communicate positively"""
2,He’s great red_heartfolded_hands_light_skin_tone
1,#5 have an accent.
2,"Great info,  thank you for making it available."

1,I am from India please translate this video in Hindi Immediately please everyone please
2,Thank you so so much! we got to learn a lot. Great session!
1,Geez! Doesn't this guy have the best public speeching posture?
1,"""Sounds"" good :)"
1,"""How to speak so that people want to listen""
Man sleeping in the audience at "
1,why would you give that speech i m in 12th grade and i have to study this as a chapter and its sucks loudly_crying_face
2,Splendid. Absolutely valuable.  Thank you.
1,"Do you sell happy pills?  Some people are always cheerful and happy.  Those Pollyanna types, people want to punch in the face.  Many individuals are not feeling well.  They have chronic physical ailments.  That is why they like to speak about the good bowel movement they had today.  It made them feel better."
1,A prevailing from of negative thinking is to take stock of a situation or an interaction and presume the negativity . One might look at a crowded commute a rainy day as automatic have negative experiences.
1,His Seven Deadly Sins are what got Trump into the Whitehouse.
0,this popped up in my recommendations and i feel attacked
1,Every one should watch this. This is the type of wisdom we need in school.
1,Step one: have an awesome accent
1,his name is fuckin Julian Treasure of COURSE his voice is beautiful
1,"In other words, tell people what they want to hear, with honesty, authenticity, integrity and love."
1,Easy to say when your last name is treasure
2,"Americans complain too. Lol I love this British guy. You can’t avoid it, but you can change your habits."
2,thanks! excellent!
1,AWESOME BUT LOOL
1,"If only someone can master the advice he gives, public speaking will be very effective. Always a delight watching and listening to him."
1,What he said make sense. But it's too hard to apply it. Maybe you need 40 hours of training before you apply it well?
1,"Don't you find it hilariously ironic that he complains about people being negative and then gives a list how you NOT should speak? The topic of this video was ""How to speak..."" and not ""how NOT to speak""."
1,I phased out halfway through this.
1,"this was not worth it, a guy standing and claiming alot but gives nothing to support it, no examples no evidence, and man is he boring."
1,Oh my God I can believe how many lost people....acting like a robot .....be you is the most important thing..not being a copy or do what everyone does...we all special and unique.... use common sense people!!!! Be happy is the secret to be authentic!
1,Thank you Julian.  It is important.  Today at  I will be practicing your voice warm up in preparation for my show.
2,wtf i just want to make good speeches and not improve my character and be a better person xd
1,not a very captivating speaker..
0,"that was weird, it is october 1st, and it is dreadful..."
1,"I would like to Thank You Sir. I started to do online teaching in regards to internet technology certifications worldwide, not video.. just audio.. voice. Your H.A.I.L. acronym worked really for me."
1,Truly a marvelous talk linking speech to values and understanding.
2,"Just poking fun. Seriously though, I enjoyed listening to you."
1,mmm that would explain why morty makes that sound after being found guilty of murdering people. . . this changes everything..
1,So basically this was nothing more than a verbal essay on one minuscule aspect of common sense.
1,Followers rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
1,The most amazing 10 minutes to start a new day!
0,Why do I have so many bad habits? I can't speak well.
1,"Me: I'm going to sleep.
Also me: Watches a video about whatever and writing a comment..."
1,Seems like it's derived from how Jordan Peterson speaks
2,It's fun watching otherwise smart people making idiotic sounds?
1,Extremely usefulthumbs_up
1,This is for the first time I have been giving these much attention to a Ted speech. Loved it.... Effective also.... I will indeed try the warm up exercises. Thank You so much.
1,he really knows about talking. awesome
1,"A lot of his advice is good for the singing voice also. Especially when he talks about warming up your voice, as those warm up exercises are used by singers as well."
1,"Couldn't disagree more with the first bit of the presentation.  Enforcing that people saying only nice things, in a nice way about people is how people -particularly in the Corporate world- ensure the turd remains in the punchbowl."
2,brilliant speech
1,I needed this
1,"Very good presentation. I have two observations though:

1) People may vote for politicians with deep voice and deep voice certainly signals power. But it also signals threat. Someone speaking to you with low pitch voice will not make you feel emotionally safe. That is why we speak to children and animals with high pitch, soft and playful voice. They understand the underlying message of safety in the voice.

2) I totally agree that complaining is very off-putting. I have to add that complaining occurs frequently and feels annoying to the listener. Also there's no genuine interest to resolve the matter.

But all complaints are not the same. Also, all complaining is not categorically useless. If someone eg. feels very ill and verbalizes it, it is not really complaining imho. Also if you almost never complain, it's not so big deal. Every now and then complaining is acceptable, but chronic and excessive whining is not. 

Complaining is a condiment that should be used sparingly."
1,Got bored 3 miinutes in
1,Please forward to Trump. I don't have his Email address. Thanks
1,"I think it's good advice to work on your voice to get people to listen to you more earnestly, but certain things like volume or pitch are ingrained in the culture from which you come, and calling them ""not nice"" or ""imposing"" is a little strong, I think. I grew up in a rather loud culture, and I ""broadcast"" as he put it when I'm at my most comfortable. I see no problem with this, because while some people take offense with it, I know why to be quiet, like at a library or in a movie theater, and I actually prefer spending time with loud people because it reminds me of home. I'm still true to myself, I still wish others well, I try to refrain from gossip and complaining, and I am very honest. Sure, not as many people enjoy listening to me, but I think whether it's ""nice"" or not is a matter of taste. Perhaps ""appropriateness"" would be a better word. There is a time and place for it."
0,ironically He lost me 2 mins in.
2,Thank God Trump has a high voice.
0,I played this on TV and lost in phone as it got boring

1,I'll spare you the 10 minutes woth my own strategy; hog the blunt
1,Why are u americans so hates another countries accents?
1,Amazing speaker; I feel enchanted!!! Very practical advice in order to communicate more effectively and cast influence.
2,"if you wish them well, you can easily judge them as well. Well, that depends on the specific definition of ""judge"" you are using, which I am probably not sure of how you mean it.
But the ultimate way to wish someone well is to actually help them improve themselves."
2,"that was awesome !!!!!!! I love every one who loved this video , I did <3how to comment so that people want to like  ;}"
2,"This is very interesting  and informative.  
Thank you!"
1,"This is all good true and fine advice but it is deception that gets the gold medal, and hardly no-one ever mention it clearly.....somehow. It really sucks, I know."
1,"Couldn't find that comment anymore - he said "" like honey, knowing full well his voice is like honey."" Exceptional Speech."
1,Isn't it like a jok and even performing to the audience hahahaha. Is there anyone experienced was that method really worked?
2,A very well polished dome.
1,First Be authentic ...... Then unnaturally lower your voice to gain authority. Not sure I'm buying into this one
1,I wouldn’t dare attend this during covid 19 grinning_face_with_sweat
1,"Sometimes we need silence. Sometimes we need to listen and process what is being said before responding. I just remembered someone nothing that it is important to have a moment of pause in responding during a conversation to allow proper thinking. 

What a world we would live in if we stopped the gossiping, negative talk, judgement, and instead actually listened, showed compassion for others, and talked effectively and with purpose… there is still hope!"
1,hey guies anybody want to listen to me
1,TEDs and speeches are pretty boring
1,I've been watching this before every important day
1,"""Theres nothing wrong with silence, is there?""

This man has obviously never been to dinner with my family."
1,"3 minutes it took for this man to bore me into pausing the video and going on to the next video. 
The only cardinal sin of speech is being utterly boring."
1,"Talk about how hard it is to know what some people say cause they wear a damn mask face_with_medical_mask 
Takes 2 to 3 x longer to find out what isle bananas banana are in."

1,Nicethumbs_up
1,"While I was trying the exercises, I said “yyyyyy” in order to say “r”. I have noticed that I can’t say “r” ."
1,"OMG, more Corporatism from the corporate shrills -- this guy is just a Crow BSin' about Sugar Candy Mountain...I guess it was bound to happen eventually, where TED and TEDx winds up regurgitating corporate propaganda (in this case, ""Corporate Quietism"" specifically)...the Emperor has no clothes but no one likes a complainer so shut up and just go along to get along...well, as George Bernard Shaw observed, progress is ALWAYS made by unreasonable people! If it were up to shrills like this guy, we'd never have left the trees or even the oceans...."

1,"What a load of politically correct bullshit, TED is becoming worst and worst.
We all know the most powerful people on earth, the ones who have the control, are where they are because of lies. dogmatism etc..."
2,its very interesting how many time you just do not realize the power of having a good speaking.
2,Good one

1,Dogmatism describes a ton of people on the internet.
1,Teach this to an AI and boom it looks human
2,"What I find interesting about this talk is that comedians and entertainers don't avoid the 7 sins, they actually rely on the 7 sins. Most comedy is based on the 7 sins. And the best comedians in the world are able to capture many people's interest. People pay to listen to their words and routines."
1,"I do want to say... I have crossed a person in my life that once taught me 2 very important aspects of this subject...
1). The hole ends when you put the shovel down
2). Always teach with a compliment... You can get almost everyone to listen with empathy, and connectivity...which A Lot of people have issues with connectivity..."
2,undoubtedly one of the best ted speech!
1,In the beginning was the Word.
1,"I loved this video for Julian Treasure whom I believe he succeeded big time in educating people on how to talk to let others listen to them, however I believe there is one more point needs to be added to his list of to do or not to do, which is, selecting the right words in the right time to the right audience."
1,Not gonna lie.  I didn't listen to this guy.

1,"@   : ""Fortunately, these things spell a word"".  (HAIL)
Me: HYDRA?"
1, I am learning that PITCH is one of the reasons why I have arguments with my hubby XD
1,"Avoid:
1.	Gossip
2.	Judging
3.	Negativity
4.	Complaining
5.	Excuses
6.	Lying
7.	Dogmatism: the tendency to lay down principles as incontrovertibly true, without consideration of evidence or the opinions of others. 



HAIL:
1.	Honesty – Be clear and straight. 
2.	Authenticity – Standing in your own truth. 
3.	Integrity - Doing what you say, be someone others can trust.  
4.	Love – Wish them well, it’s really hard to judge them when you wish others well. 



Toolbox: It increases the power of your speaking. 
1.	Register – speak with lower voices. We vote for politicians with lower voices because we associate depth with power and authority. 
2.	Timber – the way how your voice feels. We prefer voices which are rich, smooth, warm like hot chocolate. We can train, great a voice coach. 
3.	Prosody – The meta language, the sing song. It is the thing that we use to impart meaning, it’s root one for meaning in conversation. It’s hard to listen to people who speak all on one note. Don’t be monotonous. 
4.	Pace – Slow down to emphasize. We don’t have to fill our gaps with ums and ahs, silent will do.
5.	Pitch – Lower or higher. Where did you leave my keys? 
6.	Volume – Get your audience to pay attention by making your voice really quiet. 



No engine works well without being warmed up  Warm up your voice. 
1.	Arms up, deep breaths in. 
2.	Babababa
3.	Brbrbrbrbrrbr
4.	Lalalalalala 
5.	Rrrrrrrrrrrr
6.	We (high) aw (low) 



What would the world be like if we’re creating sounds consciously, designing it consciously for sound? That would be a world that sounds beautiful, and where understanding would be the norm."

1,Spread this talk TED the earth is flat.
1,"Excelent talk! I believe the most difficult habit to move away from is the pauses filled with ""uhm"" or ""eh"". And is impressive how you didn't use any of these words/sounds in a 10 minute speech (I mean, not that I've noticed). This fact encourages me to police myself in order to avoid this habit next time I present a talk or even in a casual conversation. Thank you very much!"

1,Jillian Treasure first speach was awesome and in retrospect to my first comment leaves me feeling I was harsh in what I stated or way it was stated rather. Not the case or way it was meant. I viewed the comments I made as a learning reference for both myself presenter and the architect of arrangements of playing sequence I feel this one should have lead the show as it is highly realvant to acknowleding the daughting task of public speaking or getting out of pajamas before going to McDonald's or brushing your hair at least in my case.

1, that man is listening to him fondly.
1,He really knows what he is talking about
1,"Negativity is key to making progress, I don't care what this guy says. When confronted with negative feedback about their behavior or actions, people are more likely to shrink back and take stock of what they're doing, question themselves and their actions. If a person receives constant and unchanging support and positive feedback, they are likely to delude themselves into thinking they are as great as the hype suggests, leading to a state of unwitting stagnation. It breeds egotism. The need to progress or be ""better"", or to change for the better is deemed not necessary, and I view this as dangerous and damaging psychologically. This is evident on social media sites like facebook, where the majority of its users feed each other lip-service compliments and phony sentiments about a picture of themselves or the food they are currently eating. It causes them to overvalue their own contribution to society and falsely inflates their sense of self worth, leading to a vicious circle where praise is the motivation for acting in such a way that will garner more and more praise. People that don't get told what's up in no uncertain terms grow to have a warped sense of self, and the longer they are not told that they, in fact, suck, the more they believe that they don't suck. Don't undervalue negativity. It just might be the thing that changes your mind about something you didn't even know needed to be changed."

1,"To take responsibility.  Sounds like a government thing.  When people prevent some Canadians and Ukrainians from working it is a sign.  Using mass surveillance to do it.  Part of the Canadian society doesn't know how to deal with anger.  You are taught to deal with bullying, but majority don't even know how to deal with anger themselves.  If they see anger they reflect it too.  So if you are to take bullying, maybe they should learn to take anger.  

We pay taxes so governments can take responsibility.   Your actions are not 100% your own depending on the situations.  A man with more freedom and less struggles has more choices to choose."

1,"I see the point but at the same time, it's crucial to be negative and judgmental sometimes. You need to stand up to people, you need to tell your friend when they're hurting themselves and others (this is judging and negativity). Too much positivity is not what we should be aiming for. We need balance for a successful relationship with anyone. If you're not challenging each other and helping each other improve then it's a failed and wasteful ""relationship""."

1,"All religions are like clubs ,if you don't belong you are the worst human being. Religions segregate people into factions. Muslims, Christianity, Hinduism witch craft, the masons, take your choice, all one big club. Do an idept study on religion and you will find it was invented for control purposes. The few that control the many for thousands of years understand how the human mind works so they invented clubs and religions to keep the peasants from thinking. Today millions of people rarely think for themselves, why should they, there's other people thinking for them. The most important thing for you to do is think but the most dangerous thing for the few that control the earth is for you to think. There are many denominations in America and each one claims exclusive rights to heaven and promise their followers the same. I have spent most of my life being a non joiner. Most everything I hear or read is regurgitated garb. Trust in yourself because everything else is a lie."

1,"Ironically ""How to speak so that people want to listen"" is kind of a lie, inconsistent with the content of what he said... because gossip and judging are stuff that most people want to listen to. I'm not claiming they are good things at all, but they are reality. The speech should be titled ""How to speak so that people can create a better world"" or something like that."
1,He should have implemented his own thinking because I switched of because he bored me

1,Heh heh.  He said pitch indicates arousal.  I’ve found that to be true.  beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,"Politicians broadcast the whole time it seems.
Also, silence is definitely golden and on many occasions; listening is better than talking, in my opinion. I agree that we use hyperboles too often, and in spite of what your English teacher may say; it's ok to refer to things as 'nice' and 'good'! 
I also think that technology is hindering our listening, or at least when I have head phones in, I regret to say that I don't pay full attention to the person talking and I really believe that it's important that we don't lose a connection when we communicate with people."
1,"Starting the list with gossip is kind of silly.  Yeah, people gossip, and why do we think gossip is bad?  That is a whole discussion, a scientific study ... having to do with the fact that most of what we see of other people is superficial and controlled by them.  Look at celebrities, they have PR people that make a big deal about them going to hospitals, helping the needy ... looking good, when we know damn well they are just the same as the rest of us.  So, gossip probably finds a purpose in telling us what people are really like.  Are their people who twist gossip for their own purposes or cause trouble with it, or cannot report on their own experiences, or evaluate others' experiences related to them?  Sure, gossip tells you as much about the gossiper as it does about the gossipee, but in the long run."
1,"Out of all the suggestions listed, I think ""Pace"" is perhaps the most difficult to implement. We live in a world where people don't have the patience to listen to someone who speaks slowly. You'll get interrupted constantly, or people will simply stop listening because you're taking up too much of their time. Too frequently you'll have to say what's on your mind really quickly, or not at all. Really, everything mentioned is an excellent practice, but it's only useful when speaking with someone who practices the same principles."

Every time I ask her a question I regret that moment because takes so much time to explain it. And she is looking into my eyes and it is like she is trying to understand if what is she saying makes any sense. Normally you get the point after 10 words but NO she is still trying to explain to me with 2, 3 examples. By the time she is done, I am in my tea break."
1,"Notes for myself: 

7 deadly habits that we can easily fall into and need to move away (avoid/break):
1.Gossip: the person gossiping about, 5 minutes later will be gossiping about us
2. Judging:   it's very hard to listen to someone if you know you are being judged
3. Negativity: it's hard to listen sb's negative
4. Conplaining (national art of the UK): i is viral misery
5. Excuses: some people have a blame thrower => thay just pass it on to everybody else
6. Embroidery/lying/exaggeration: it demeans our language actually sometimes
7. Dogmatism: Facts and opinions get conflated -> Listen into the wind

4 powerful cornerstone/ foundation we can stand on
Honesty: being true in what you say
Authenticity: being yourself 
Intergrity: being your word
Love: wishing people well

Amazing toolbox
1. Register: you can locate your voice. If you want weight, you need to gown down to the chest. We cote fot politicians with lower voices bc we associate depth with power and authority
2. Timber: the way our voice feel.
3. Prosody: people who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to -> monotonic. Repetitive prospdy where every sentences end as if they were a question when it's actually a statement
4. pace: slow right down to emphasize or get very excited by saying sth really quickly. Silence, there is nothing wrong with a bit of silence.
5. pitch
6. voulume: the quieter the better in making some pay attention/ bringing attention. But dont be too quiet all the time and dont be a broadcaster"

You both experience exactly the same feeling when you get uncomfortable, sad or just happy. Once you feel this, or realize this, you will start noticing that when you are talking to a stranger or a family member or a friend, you are talking to yourself."

	This week I watched the documentary Being the Change. Prior to watching the documentary I've always been told to be aware of my waste in ways such as energy and food. This has always been in the back of my mind, but to actually have real action seemed to be discouraging. My concerns of the increasing rate of CO2 emissions left me feeling hopeless. Although after watching this documentary a whole new world of possibilities have been exposed to me. Peter Klamus in the film has made his emissions cut down to 1/10th of the average American by altering aspects of his daily life. Having alternate routes such as having a backyard garden, biking around town, and reducing food waste can cause a small but worth it difference. Food production has about 40% waste. Quality food is being thrown away without even an afterthought. There should be different routes people and companies take to help ensure this food is not being wasted and be given to people that perhaps really need it. I think if our society could keep things like this in mind, as a community we can help reduce our emissions. Even new inventions such as humanure makes an important difference. Joe Jenkins created humanure to help make sure soil has proper nutrients naturally without the need of fertilizers. Therefore creating one less consumerized item in our markets. This would allow for a full cycle that benefits our environment. Ideas like these are the ones that will help transition our culture to a greener one. By having an open mind to new ideas, humans as a society have a chance to help save the planet. 

I think a part of the film that particularly stuck to me was the bit about happiness. Materialism has been at the forefront of what we think of as happiness. Having “the good life” with materialistic items is the key to happiness. This is what advertisements tell us, celebrities, and the entertainment industry in general. Vipassana meditiations are seen as outlets to allow yourself to truly experience each passing moment. By taking it one moment at a time, humans can try to ease anxieties or fustrations. Which consequently, can cause a person to reach happiness and confront their problems and take a breather.  The film also addresses how serving others can be the secret to happiness. I think a shift in thinking with these previously said tools, can help people realize the true importance in life and how happiness can actually be achieved. The richest person in the world may be the saddest. Being rich does not equate to being happy. I think I've always known this, but have still sought out a life that includes lots of money. I've taken a step back to realize what I truly need in life and although I still strive for a stable amount of money in my future, it does not need to be an exorbitant amount that is uneeded."

1,"Relatively good

Are you speaking to people about things they have no idea about they need more explanation as to what those things are simple examples don’t suffice because most people are blind to their own shortcomings however when they show up because they’re projecting them on to other people and there is some deep-seated reason as to why they do these things including poor patterns of communication which isn’t really about speech per se it’s the spoken word which is a bit different I think

Alyssa say we all have some of us even as conscious as we might be or try to be we also have to integrate the shadow by loving acknowledging and excepting this is how we heal and when we heal ourselves we are able to heal others words can be very very powerful and they can also be very very destructive

But everything serves a purpose which is another thing we must keep in mind for me integrity is the most important thing and once that is the umbrella of your life and all of the other things go without saying however there are some guilt and shame in here when people want to tell their story and they have to second-guess themselves as to whether or not that’s OK because even if they do except responsibility there are people out here telling them not to listen to the seven deadly spoken words or behavioral patterns which are simply a cry for help and some are meant to be deceitful 

In a case where a person isn’t able to except some measure of responsibility or accountability could very well be that beneath all of that is a ton of grief or they are guilty and shaming themselves or someone else has

This was too short and too sweet to make total sense"

1,"In a perfect world it would be great that human beings are innately reasonable beings that act based on unbiased facts and being conscious of our actions. But the reality is almost completely opposite. We are simply unconscious of what we do and perceive almost all the time. For example we consciously decide to walk to a door and enter, but we are simply unaware of the process that we need to get up, walk to the door, stop the right distance from door, find the door handle, turning it, pulling the door, while the door is open we need to lift our leg to start walking etc. Our brains are wired not to act sensibly, but act based on beliefs. The more fundamental the belief the less likely are we to question it. The belief can be right, but very often is wrong. And the key to make people listen, is to pander to their beliefs, and if their beliefs arouse emotional responses, such as anger or fear or happiness, or joy no matter what the tone is, they will listen. The great tool propagandists have used to make most people listen so attentively they become driven to initiate action, was to create a belief by simple repetition on sources that reach the target audience, through a trusted source of that audience. The trusted source is for example a priest in a religious society, or a doctor in a society that values health. Take for example how we all believe now in the value of individualism, and most perceive it as a desired trait to be expressed in our social environment. 

Terms like freedom (to act like we believe is good), uniqueness, originality are associated with goodness. We we here these terms it brings out a positive emotional response. Do we ever question the meaning of these terms and listen to people that refute the validity of these terms? Serial murderers are very unique individuals, who feel free to harm another human being. Is a display of originality in their actions desirable?

We shouldn't forget that if the message is complicated that requires critical thinking and critical reasoning capacity, then tune out of targeted audience is all but guaranteed . The delivery is important in how effective is our communication. but we keep failing to understand that the effects seen in complex environment have multiple causes, that the narrow focus blind us from looking at factors that are far more important then the prioritized cause. People will listen to this talk and will listen, not because of the delivery by a talented speaker, but because it supports peoples tendency to seek simple concrete explanation for their questions. We also need not forget that the topic deals with issues affect people's lives and our sense of self-worth. I heard so many people talk about that if another person really sees them for who they really are, they would act the way they want to. The whole opinion is based on a complete certainty in the validity on their idea. So lack of self-awareness leads people to impart much more importance to outside causes, instead of looking internally. So this talk will have a great display of interest, but it plays to people's already held beliefs of individual self-importance"

Your 7 commandments are a genius way to keep people sedated, just like religion really. Progress and improvement can never happen without criticism. People who can't listen to criticism are not worth knowing. If that has become more than 50% of the population then we're all doomed to shun anyone who sees a problem coming, and never be prepared for the problem. Basically what you are saying is most people are idiots who can't handle the truth. If what will make them listen is dumbing down and sugar coating the truth then why talk to them at all?"

1,"Like wishing your sibling well after telling you he’s decided to cheat on his spouse? You might not say it to them, but in your mind you will think, no that’s wrong you can’t do that. That’s a judgment. You’re making a distinction between what’s right to do and what’s not. Deciding someone shouldn’t gossip is a judgment. Because gossiping is NOT the right thing to do. We do this all the time. What we must refrain from is condemnation. 

Loving them (to Will their good or in this case wishing them well) is to talk to them about their decision (without coercion) and show them the right thing to do. 

Non judgmentalism—a slippery slope—says everything is the same. No wrong or right. True or false. Real and counterfeit. Moral and immoral. 

Make judgments. But refrain from condemnation.

1,"2/ Judging.  Disagree  I WANT to hear from ppl who have examined an issue and have a strong supported case abt whether something is right/wrong, moral/immoral, true/false  and this is a judgement.  Ppl who fail to form judgements are pusillanimous, and their speech is useless.   
3/ Negativity.  Depends on whether the negativity is part of a reasoned assessment, describing the problem,  and *hopefully* improvements.

On the 4 points - honestly & integrity are required in order to take anyone seriously, BUT I am not swayed by emotional appeals.  ""Love"" and ""Authenticity"" are often used as a means to deceive by appeals to emotion.  When some politician expresses the ""love and authenticity"" of 'feeling my pain' - we can be certain they are demagoging by appeals to emotion driven by an ulterior motive.

We all need a class in critical thinking.  ""Wanting"" to listen to a speech isn't the same (and is often the opposite), of the speaker making good rational points.  So let's keep the emotionism of ""want to listen""   out of it, and try to hear ALL voices fairly and honestly  - especially those we find dislikeable."

I have seen various people using words that imply those sins. It was also really good to know about “HAIL” that meant “to greet or acclaim enthusiastically” and contained honesty, authenticity, integrity, and love. In addition, the six vocal warm-up exercises 
helped me a lot!!! Finally, the questions that were asked in the conclusion of this speech were so remarkable that I would never forget!! :D"

1,"One way to sound boring and make people tune you out is if you constantly use the word ""amazing.""  This is a word that needs to be taken out back and shot immediately. So many people continue to overuse it, that it means very little today. This is AMAAAZING. That's AMAAAZING. You look...AMAAAZING!. Used once in a while, as Julian has done, is OK. 

It's kind of humorous (if not slightly annoying) when someone, usually a millennial or teen, describes something, and actually has to pause, as if thinking of an adjective, but still falls back on, ""OMG, that is, like, sooo...AMAZING."" 

Vary your adjectives.  While you're at it, stop peppering your sentences with ""like,"" or starting every sentence with ""So."" Otherwise, you'll come across as having a very limited vocabulary and being boring. As a result, people will stop paying attention."

1,"I heard ""Don't be negative and don't complain because it's hard for others to listen to."" Okay when someone is complaining, there's something alive in them and they may or may not be in touch with that. Either way they're expressing their unpleasant emotion indirectly and what they're really saying is ""please listen to my pain."" If you don't have the energy to listen to their pain, say so. If you listen when you don't want to, someone will pay for that.

But that brings up a separate tendency we have which is to not be able to enjoy presence with someone, even when they're in pain. Our tendency is to offer sympathy: ""oh that's so terrible I'm so sorry that happened to you..."" or deflect with a silver lining: ""well it could be worse!"" or take sides: ""Yeah what a jerk that person is!"" or give unsolicited advice: ""you should do this... and stop doing that..."" We're not educated to enjoy being in the presence of what's alive in someone even when what's alive in them is pain.

This has 31 million views but I fear it perpetuates our behaviors that separate us from what's alive in others."

1,"I was a professional pilot back in the days when carbon mikes were the only choice. As a female, I learned to lower my voice’s pitch in order to activate the carbon crystals. Discovered that I also got a lot more respect and was heard better when I used the deeper richer timbre. Also stopped ending all sentences like a question. That really eliminated a lot of confusion with air traffic control."

1,"These are also part of our personality. Without any of this I don't understand how anyone can have a conversation of any value. Trying to be positive all the time, you end up lying to yourself. People's attitude these days are so selfish. Take someone who wants to vent or is asking for help, that would deemed as negative and self-loathing, so they avoid that person. People that have their life together will obviously speak at arms length."

1,"What drives me crazy is that people don't seem to care about what you say, but how you say it.  Therefore if you have the most amazing thing, but say it wrong, you will get no interest.  But if you have something stupid to say, but say it right, everyone will love you.  Facts don't seem to matter as long as what you say appears factual, even though it may not be.  People seem so vulnerable to manipulation.  So often they just want to be entertained and are open to being manipulated as a result.  It is just amazing, but you see it every day."

1,"The Measures of a Good Speaker are focused on others: Honesty, Empathy/Listening (by doing only 1/2 the talking and allowing for honest questions and comments), and Keeping One's Word, NOT self-focused: how loud (a vain appeal to power) or fast (vain appeal to intellect) one can talk."
1,within three minutes How to  to deal with a Karen
1,Well Not doing all of these things is impossible. The important fact to remember is to not be like that all the time.
1,"From your point of view, might I ponder;
If in fact people have two ears and only one mouth but are several times over wanting to speak more effectively than to listen more often . . .
Might it therefore be reasonable that people would prefer to blather on & on whether another wants to hear it than to just listen and determine when it's time to go to listen to someone who actually knows what they're talking about is better to be heard?"
1,"what amazes me is that he never talked about how when someone talks about a specific topic in your accent it seems more impotant,but when you dont its like one of those infomercials you see late night,they may have something important to say,but theres a reason they're on at 3 in the morning."

1,"I just wanted to point something which has absolutely nothing to do with the speech itself. I was watching this talk with Spanish subtitles. In the part he says: (  ) ""my god, you look ugly this morning"" even though there's no gender for ""you"" in English, it was translated as if he was talking to a ""she"". This is indirectly telling us: a man will never be judged by his aspect, in fact people won't even notice whether he's wearing the exactly same clothes as yesterday or not but about what he has to say. The one who always receives this kind of unnecessary, disrespectful and sexist comments is the woman herself.
We must change these little details so that our society can move forward.
Please careful on that."
1,"People in the US listen to FOX News every day, knowing that they are being lied to."
1,Someone should go Clockwork Orange on (insert potentially orange politician here) and make him watch this till it sticks.
1,"The content about voice was interesting. 

The content about what to say was true, but irrational. 
If you are positive all the time, you are ignoring atleast half of the possible perspectives. Given, you can still see the perspectives - just not talk about them, but if you never talk about them, then you never really share the opinion either and so other people will never know about them. 
By doing so, you are activelly looking away from potential ways to solve problems. It is therefore irrational to follow ""hail""."
1,"He's just copying everything the Lord Says to do in the Bible, except the vocal exercises, any one else notice this?"

1,"It takes me many seconds to remember the words, then at least a minute to rearrange the words into a coherent sentence. By the time it gets out everyone's gone home. His description of the person with the 7 deadly sins sounds like every single boss I have ever had. I don't see one political operative right now from Trump to Boris Johnston who practices HAIL. Repetitive prosody is how Australians speak.  Sounds ridiculous when you have been away for a while and you get back to Oz and the newsreader speaks like that. (as a series of what sounds like questions)"

1,"7 sins of speaking:
gossip
judging
negativity
complaining
excuses, not taking responsibility
exaggeration, that can become lying
dogmatism, confusion of facts with opinions

H - honesty, be clear and straight
A - authenticity, be yourself
I - integrity, be your word, trustworthy
L - love, wish people well

Humans prefer voices, that are low(coming from chest), rich, warm, smooth. YOU can train to get there (coach, posture, breathing, exercises).
Change tones, to communicate meanings. Dont use wrong tonality and make it reflect what you are trying to communicate.
Pace
Silence
Pitch - how high
Volume - from  loud to quiet


Exercises:
2X  arms up, deep breath in  -  breath out as arms go down
warm up lips ""ba, ba, ba...""    
lips coming alive ""brrrr"" like kids
tongue exaggerated ""la, la, la, la""
""rrrrrrrrr"" like champagne for the tongue
siren high to low 2x ""oooweeeeaaaw""  copied comment , used for reminder perposes"

Do people listen to what you have to say or do they tune you out?  Is it more important to you to speak your mind in whatever manner you choose or that others' minds may be changed by what you say?

4) complaining -> I need to work on this sin
5) excuses
6) lying (embroidery, exaggeration)
7) dogmatism (confusion between fact and opinion)

2. what I need to say: four powerful cornerstones of speech to make a change in the world

1) H: honesty (be clear and straight)
2) A: authenticity (be myself)
3) I: integrity (be my word)
4) L: love (wish them well)

3. how I need to say: tools to play with to increase power of my speech
1) register: e.g. if wanting weight, lower pitch of voice
2) timbre: the way voice feels e.g. breathing, posture
3) prosody: rhythm (e.g. not monotone)
4) pace: e.g. slow to emphasize
5) pitch: e.g. make pitch high or low
6) volume: e.g. louder to emphasize

4. exercise the following before making a presentation

1,How to speak so people want to listen: have a British accent.
1,"If I ever stop complaining, I'm probably dead.  Gossip is fun in small amounts, it allows you to confirm your own impression of other people.  Make sure the person you are talking to is not running their mouth and you have their attention. Make sure you aren't trying to have a deep conversation in a clanging emergency room.  There are all sorts of and levels of truthfulness and lying.  You work for a company that suffers from delusions, you subscribe to a religion that as a price of membership requires that you ""believe"" or ""agree"" with certain things.  People say they love and value their employees, members when half the things they do shows that they really don't.  If you live long enough and pay enough attention, you will be able to know who is lying and who is telling the truth.  Nobody tells the truth all the time.  Some people are pathological liars.  If you close your mouth and listen and watch people enough, remember enough, it isn't hard to determine who those people are."
0,What about person with a stutter?
1,"My problem is if I'm in a conversation, and something the other person says reminds me of something I want to say. I stop listening to them and repeat in my head what I don't want to forget."
1,"Watching this talk made me think that public speaking is likely an art. Just as no one wants to hear a song that has only one tone (monotonous) or will not be long interested in a painting that does not have colors, textures or shapes that catch your attention, if you do not know how to structure your speech, use your voice wisely, and avoid falling into vulgarity, people will not want to hear you. 

The speaker needs to use his voice with the same skill that a musician plays his instrument and that the painters use his brush."

And yep: she has tons of friends and acquaintances.Which is not something that I can say for me. But I don't expect the whole world to like me..i'm just surprised how undervalued some values are nowadays. "
1,The chap at  wasnt listening...lol

1,Just came across this channel today so I be sure watching some of the videos .
1,"Very well said. The speaker used verbal and non-verbal communication. In this video I gain more knowledge on how to deal or talk with other people especially for catching their attention to listen to me. As a student this is applicable for me. upside-down_face

2,Thank You Julian Treasure

1,"I'm a consultant and I often have to speak in public, Treasure Talk Julian has been very useful."
1,"This is mind control. This man is trying to make you weak by being secretive with your friends (anti-gossip = fracturing your social networks), not judging = not making moral relativism the norm so if you're manipulated you'll just sit there and take it because theres no such as bad."
1,"How to speak so that people want to listen:

1,well...this was a waste of time.
1,The way he speaks I must say is excellent...
2,THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!
1,"I think.
Public speakers should follow the listeners interest."
1,Lower register for authority isn't that helpful for those of the 50% of the population who aren't men. Perhaps more elaboration is needed on this point.
2,Lord Varys is cool
1,epic 4 brought me here.
1,"I feel like I should say that doing those vocal exercises elevated my mood from depressed to okay. I'm not suggesting it as a replacement for anything, but definitely worth doing if you're feeling down for a moment."
1,This speech should be taught in all the schools and universities!
2,nice thanx
1,"Didn't really understand his 6th ,, deadly sin""

Lying is definitely not a good thing. However exaggerations and embroidery makes people LISTEN to your story, not the other way around.

If you just saying: ,, this day was great "" or ,, that was the best day of my LIFE!""

Everyone can decide for themselves, but personally the second raises way more attention to your story. That's what the video is all about isn't."
1,"Honestly, I find it hard to stay away from gossip, whether it's listening or doing it myself. I'm not proud of it, I try to stay away from it but when I socialize, I can't help it especially it's something common to do when I am with other people and I can't just stay alone all the time."

TOLERANCE : Conditional Positive Regard,

1,"Use a lot of big words, talk real loud and real fast."
2,"Trump commits all seven sins, and his fans lap it up."
1,"""If you are wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you could do those two things simultaneously."" I think this bears repeating many, many times in our culture, especially to those who profess to love others and ""hate the sin not the sinner"" but who always seem to want to bring the sin up in every conversation about that sinner. You know who you are. It's like, if you can't look past a person's sin and look at them for who they are, which is a child of God, than do you really love them? Are you demonstrating your love? Or is it just empty talk?"
1,"The vocal exercises may seem a bit silly, but these ""warm-ups"" make an audible difference when you deliver a speech. They also, for some reason, help (me, anyway) overcome some of the pre-performance jitters. It works in the theater, and just as well in the conference room or auditorium."

the human voice:
人間の声は、


it's the  instrument we all play. 
誰もが奏でるものですが、

    
it's the most powerful sound in the world, probably. It's the only one that can start a war or say “I love you.”　
世界で最も力強い音だと言えます。人間の声だけでしょう。戦争を始め、愛を伝えられるのは。

    
And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people don’t listen to them.
でも話してるのに、誰も聞いていないという経験をされた方も多いでしょう。


And why is that?
なぜなのでしょうか？


How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world?
どうすれば力強く話し、世界を変えられるのでしょうか？

     
What  I’d like to suggest, there are a number of habits that we need to move away from.
私がご提案したいのは、悪しき習慣を止めることです。


I’ve assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking.
皆さんのためにここに、「話者の七つの大罪」を用意しました。

     
I’m not pretending this is an exhaustive list, but these seven, I think, are pretty large habits that we can all fall into.
網羅的なものだと言うつもりはありませんが、この七つはかなり影響の大きい、私たちが陥りがちな悪習慣です。


First,gossip.
1つ目はうわさ話。


Speaking ill of somebody who’s not present.
その場にいない人の悪口を言うことです。

Not a nice habit, and we know perfectly well the person gossiping, five minutes later,
will be gossiping about us.
いい習慣ではないですね。ご承知のとおり悪口を聞いて5分後には、その悪口を言っていた人は、私たちのことを噂してます。


Second, judging.
2つ目は批評です。

        
We know people who are like this in conversation, and it’s very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you’re being judged and found wanting at the same time.
思い当たる人いますよね。聞く気になりませんよね。自分が批判の対象となり、ダメ出しをされているんですから。


Third, negativity.
3つ目はネガティブさ

You can fall into this.
後ろ向きになることもありますよね。


My mother, in the last years of her life, became very negative, and it’s hard to listen.
私の母は晩年、本当にネガティブで聞いてられませんでした。

     
I remember one day, I said to her, “It’s October 1 today”. and she said, “I know, isn’t it dreadful?”
ある日私が母に「今日は10月1日だね」と言うと、母はこう答えたんです「そうよ最悪だわ」


It’s hard to listen when somebody’s that negative. 
こんなに後ろ向きだと聞くに耐えません。


And another form of negativity, complaining.
ネガティブといえば不平もそうでしょう。


Well, this is the national art of the U.K. 
イギリスのお国芸ですが、


It’s our national sport. We complain about the weather, sport, about politics, about everything, 
国技でもありますよね。天気やスポーツ、政治など何にでも不平をこぼします。


but actually, complaining is viral misery. It’s not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world.
でも不平なんて不幸をまき散らすだけで、世界に温かさや光をもたらしてはくれません。


Excuses.
そして言い訳がましい人いますよね。

   
We’ve all met this guy. Maybe we’ve all been this guy. Some people have a blamethrower. 
身に覚えもあるでしょうが、責任転嫁ばかりする人もいます。

    
They just pass it on to everybody else and don’t take responsibility for their actions, and again, 
他人に責任をなすりつけ自らの行動に責任をとらないのです。


hard to listen to somebody who is being like that.
そんな人の話はやはり聞いていられません。

     
Penultimate, the sixth of the seven, embroidery, exaggeration. It demeans our language, actually, sometimes. For example, if I see something that really is awesome,what do I call it?
最後から2つ目。6番目の大罪は、脚色・誇張です。時に言葉の格を落とします。「すごい」を連発していたらいざ何か本当に「すごい」ものを見てもそれを表現する言葉がないでしょう？

   
And then, of course, this exaggeration becomes lying, out and lying and we don’t want to listen to people we know are lying to us.
当然この誇張は嘘にもつながります。嘘ばかりではやがて誰も耳を貸さなくなります。


And finally, dogmatism. 


The confusion of facts with opinions. 

        
When those two things get conflated, you’re listening into the wind. You know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. 


it’s difficult to listen to that.
最後は独善的になり事実と意見を混同することです。この2つをごっちゃにしてしまうと何も耳に入ってきません。誰かに自分の意見をさも事実かのようにぶつけられても聞けたものではないでしょう。


So here they are, seven deadly sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid.
以上が「話者の7つの大罪」で私たちが避けるべきことです。


But is there a positive way to think about this?
でも前向きに取り組むべきこともできるでしょうか？

 Yes、 there is. 
ええできます。


I’d like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones, foundations,


 that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world.
私たちの話に力を与え世界を変えるために私たちが立脚すべき-4つの強力な礎があります。


Fortunately, these things spell a word.
4つの頭文字を取るとある言葉になります。


The word is “hail,” and it has a great definition as well.
「HAIL」です。意味も素晴らしいんですよ。


I’m not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head.
Hailといっても空から降ってくる-「あられ」のことではなく


I’m talking about this definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, 
｢熱烈に歓迎する｣という意味です。


which is how I think our words will be received if we stand on these four things. 
この4つを拠り所にして言葉を届けるとそんな反応が返ってくるはずです。"

I got in touch with him and behold, Dr Abaka told me that he will prepare a spell for me that will bring back my husband. I was skeptical but i had no other option but to work with him. 2 days after, my husband called me that he's coming back home and from that day till this moment, we have been living peacefully. He is back now with so much love and caring. today i am glad to let you all know that this spell caster have the powers of bringing lovers back. because i am now happy with my husband,and the most surprise,is that our love is very strong,every day is happiness and joy. and there is nothing like been with the man you love.

Well It's because this is useless babble, so of course you would want to discourage negativity! Hey, I'm all bout love, but love isn't never being critical. What you are saying is ""hail"", and then encouraging a group of people to make the same arm gesture, while selling the idea that controlling you're voice pitch will give you more agency in life."

I really wonder what would happen if more people learned and used this theory, not only for big speeches but also for normal conversations.

1,What's Lord Varys doing here?
1,"7 habits to move away from:
1) Gossip, speaking ill from others, if someone is speaking bad about another person, easily in the future will be speaking bad about you too.
2) Judging, if you feel that you are judged, you will put a subconscious barrier.
3) Negativity, it is hard to listen, they tend to bring you down.
4) Complaining, viral misery. People that always have a comment on how bad are their lives.
5) Excuses, sometimes there are people that do not take responsibility for what they say or do. They need to blame another thing or someone.
6) Exaggeration (LYING), sometimes this becomes lies
7) Dogmatism, when there is a confusion between facts and opinions. They only throw opinions as all of those are true (not cemented on anything).
4 cornerstones:
Honesty, straight and clear
Authenticity, stand in your own truth. Be yourself.
Integrity, do what you say you were going to do. You will become trustworthy.
Love, wish well to the people. Try not to judge, just wish them well!
Voice Toolbox: get a voice coach
* Register, try to put your voice at your chest, it will have more weight.
* Timber, the way your voice feels. We prefer smooth, sweet voices.
* Prosody, the rhythm, i.e., the pauses and stresses that you put when you speak.
* Pace, how fast you say your phrases, you can slow down (to emphasize) or increase the speed (to get excited). Silence can be really powerful.
* Pitch, the way intonate what you say. If you always have the same pitch, you will sound like a robot.
* Volume: if you lower your voice you will make people pay close attention to you, you could add enthusiasm to your speech through higher volume.
WARM UP YOUR VOICE!!
Arms up + deep breath in + sight out loudly x2.

1,"Notes and summary for myself

The seven deadly sins of Speaking

    1. Gossip: Speaking negatively about someone who is not present. People will not trust you because a while later, you will gossip about them.
    2. Judging: It is hard to listen to someone who consistently judge you during a conversation.
    3. Negativity: Having a negative viewpoint on things. 
    4. Complaining: which is mere viral misery. Could be on anything, politics, sports, or the weather.
    5. Excuses: Not taking responsibility for our actions and being a blame-thrower
    6. Exaggeration: Drawing an imaginary image and inflating stuff excessively. It can get to the point of outright **lying**.
    7. Dogmatism: stating your opinions as if they are facts without consideration of an evidence to support your claims. In other words, Bombarding people with biased opinions on a certain topic.


- Foundation of powerful speech (HAIL)

    1. Honesty: Being clear and straight. Not using deception and lies. But using brutal and unnecessary honesty could hurt people. ""Honesty tempered with Love"".
    2. Authenticity: Being yourself and not imitating a non-genuine persona. ""Standing in your own truth"".
    3. Integrity: Be your word. Do what you say. Be trustworthy, and take responsibility.
    4. Love: Wishing people well. No judgement.


- Toolbox of Speech (Voice)

    1. Register: Talk from your chest, not the nose or throat. ""We vote for the politicians with lower voices"". People associate depth with power and authority.
    2. Timbre: The way the voice feels. ""Rich, Smooth, Warm, like hot chocolate."" It is a skill that can be trained.
    3. Prosody: Talking with enthusiasm, having a rhythmic voice, and not being monotonic like a robot. Avoid repetitive prosody as if every statement was a question.
    4. Pace: Talk normally and slow right down to... *Emphasize*. Talking fast or slow at the right time is key in conveying your point.
    5. Silence: A powerful tool to bring attention. Should not be filled with filler words such as UH's and UM's.
    6. Pitch: To deliver an idea or ask a question and being understood. (The caps-lock of speech)
    7. Volume: The quieter the better in bringing attention. But don't be too quiet all the time and don't be a broadcaster too. Pay attention to your loudness.


- Warm up the toolbox of voice

    1. Arms up, take a deep breath and sigh.
    2. Lips: (BA BA BA)
    3. Lips: Horse sound
    4. Tongue: Exaggerated (LA LA LA)
    5. Tongue: Roll an R (RRRRR)
    6. The siren (WEEEE [High] yoooo [Low])

Speaking is one part of the puzzle because having a good conversation also depends on being a good listener.

Edit: Reconstructed the phrasing of the point of dogmatism.

And using that phrase ""your truth"" tells to me lot of about the person judging by other people who like to use it in their motivational speeches, presentations and arguments. Even though he said not to judge, you also should try to avoid saying things that are just down right false."

1,"Some good points, but one could argue that in politics and society it is the LACK of critical faculties in language or the trotting out of cliches driven by the mainstream media that most disengages those who would otherwise be interested in listening. Being ""positive"" is of course desirable but not at the expense of compliance. Sometimes we do not complain enough, or divert our complaining into trivia. Complaining about the duplicity and bad behaviour of particularly public and powerful figures is something we don't do enough of in an effective way. BTW October 1st is capable of being a dreadful day!!!"

1,"1) Pose a compelling question, 2) state your answer/conclusion about it, 3) challenge audience to follow and see if your evidence/examples make that conclusion correct---and get to it. Now people watch like a hawk. Secondly, many listeners are lost for a much simpler reason---bad diction. ""Uhhm"" is dead noise: just pause. ""He was like..."" is not a synonym for ""He said"" (or better verbs), and using it without comparing something else after it is dead noise too. ""You know"" means you haven't said what you mean and hope the listener knows anyway. Just pause, and get it right: then people are naturally drawn in."

1,"How to speak so that people want to listen | Julian Treasure
Intro

The human voice is the most powerful sound in the world, yet many people have experienced that people don't listen to them.

I want to suggest that we should all move away from the seven deadly sins of speaking.

You can fall into negativity, and it's hard to listen to somebody who's that negative.

Exaggeration demeans our language, and we don't want to listen to people lying to us.

Seven deadly sins of speaking are listed, but there is a positive way to think about this. Four things spell a word, ""hail,"" which is how I believe our terms will be received if we stand on these four things.

The H is for honesty, the A is for authenticity, the I is for integrity, and the L is for love. Tempered with love, honesty is great, but it's hard to judge someone simultaneously.
What you say

You have a fantastic toolbox, and I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now and pull out a few tools to increase your speaking power.

We vote for politicians with lower voices because we associate depth with power and authority. You can improve the register and timbre of your voice with breathing, posture, and exercises.

Prosody is the sing-song, the meta-language we use to impart meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note are really hard to listen to if they have no prosody.

Pace, pitch, and volume can indicate arousal in a talk. Don't broadcast your sound to people around you carelessly and inconsiderately, though.

When you've got something important to do, you owe it to yourself to warm up your voice. I'll be sure to show you how to do that.
Vocal warmup exercises

I will show you six vocal warm-up exercises I do before every talk I ever do. They include arms up, deep breath in, and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that, one more time, perfect.

The pros call this the siren, and it starts with ""we"" and goes to ""aw."" If we were to create sound consciously, consume sound consciously, and design all our environments intentionally for sound, the world would sound beautiful."
1,I find this guy quite patronizing
1,why am i learning voice warming exercises from wilson fisk
1,Why is it always that the most important thing appears to be to try and make people want to listen. Surely instead the most important thing should be to spread truth
1,Anyone like me scrolling in the comments looking for those guys who makes sum up of the Talks grinning_squinting_face
1,he reminds me of Benedict Cumberbatch O.o
1,"This guy need those lessons more than anybody else. 3 minutes into this video , I was already yawning."
1,Trump hit all 7 of them
1,"Can't roll my r's :/ can't whistle either.... oh well, the other exercises r nice... I recall long ago being a decent speaker, having forgotten much, this is a wonderful reminder... now I just need something of actual importance to say ;)"
1,I tuned out at 41 seconds.
1,This is one of my favorite talks of all time. The presentation itself is a testament of these techniques
1,"Strange that 62,984,825 people in the USA don't fit the human instinct to turn off from blatant pathological lying and arrogance though, and contrary to what is being said in the video, seem to thrive on BS."
1,"How to speak so that people want to listen. Simply , speak the truth> when somebody speaks only the truth many people listen if they like it or not.  When the truth is against somebody people should also listen because they must make certain improvements in their behavior. Most importantly the only one requirement from our Creators is ""always speak the truth"". When people lie other people suffer. but those people who lie suffer most. Why? Because our nature provided us with a conscious mind and with judging tools so that we can tell the right from wrong. So Yes, we must be judgmental. We have this ability to judge and I imply here judging accurately and correctly and not lying. About negativity, just analyse the english language and you get a very good idea about not only negativity but contradictory meanings. two examples: the word understand is made of two words. ""Under and stand"" It implies here that you must not understand but to stand under. the word off course meaning to be on the wrong path. I know why. Do you? And by the way your name is Treasure.  Complaining . the society should be organized in such a manner so that people can complain about other people's behavior and some officials to take action. like North Korea. Lying . who are the lyers of the world??????And why. I know who and I know why. Do you under stand ?  Mr. Treasure????????"
1,"i allways think before saying something but, then too i say somthing else..."
1,That was a wonderful talk! Thank you smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes My dogs got a kick out of the warm ups; turned into 'doggie playtime' lol. I'm going to apply the new tools I learned from you in my communication and know I will see positive results grinning_face_with_big_eyes thanks again!

1,His head is shinning more then his words
1,"the only thing i learned is to orgistrate , the public, no problem solving, sorry!"
1,"I learnt this year about listening and how powerful it is to listen.  Have you ever thought that when you're in a conversation and someone is venting, regardless if it's moaning or being negative, that if we just listen and not say anything, you'll find out why or even how that person really feels. It's when we intervene, give our advice or opinion that it drives the conversation elsewhere which isn't necessarily bad but i also think it's bad to have an automatic response to people and what they say. Listen to those who you care about. Don't reply back straight away. And see the magic of it. Listening will take you to a person's story that you didn't even know existed because you gave them the chance and time to, and that's what i learnt.

 Have a good day everyone. x"
1,"Unfortunately the basic premise of HAIL is wrong. As Trump and Johnson have both proven Honesty and Integrity are not necessarily required to make people listen and judging, complaining, excuses, lying and dogmatism do not stop people from wanting to listen to you if you tell them what they want to hear."
1,"I hardly ever watch a complete 10-minute speech.

Just think for a moment.
How are you going to be after death ?!
Can you believe that this exact system of the universe and all of these great creation will end in in nothing...just after death!
Have you thought, for a second, How to save your soul from Allah's punishment?!
Haven't you thought about what is the right religion?!
Read ... and think deeply before you answer..
It is religion of Islam.
It is the religion that Mohammad-peace upon him- the last prophet, had been sent by.
It is the religion that the right Bible- which is not distorted-has preached.
Just have a look at The Bible of (Bernaba).
Don't be emstional.
Be rational and judge..
Just look..listen...compare..and then judge and say your word.

1,"Nice, quite useful, but one thing is missing: you need to have something (preferably interesting) to talk about.  I think the three 'A's are most important: appearance (how you look, your manner); attentiveness (pay attention to your audience, have a conversation WITH not AT the other person, show interest); assertiveness (confident but not over bearing, relaxed but not overfamiliar, and a bit of confessed nervousness isn't a bad thing).   I would add a fourth 'A': adventure - do interesting things in your life, whatever your bag, so you have things to talk about, and you can usually find some common conversational ground.  Oh, and be nice to people, put them at their ease, everybody's day will go so much better."

You feel like ramming all those lemons down their throat. Like people so full of energy it's painful to sit still don't really understand people who don't walk up at least one mountain each day after work. It's more complex than just a matter of ""priority"".

My point? Many of us need to get out of that pool of lemons before we can start to hone our communication skills. Everything is connected, so a lack of successful communication is of course likely to be one of the things that keep filling that pool with lemons."

1,I can't understand a thing this guy is saying . .  .
1,Are these principles only for close family and friends? Because I apply all these suggestions with strangers and colleagues and I still get ignored. I think there must be more to it than this video suggests.
1,"I am so thankful, Treasure and Ted  gave this video  to me and  everyone . It is useful for me in  many areas."

1,"Title : How to speak so that people want to listen
Me : Read the comments section"
1,"33. And who is better in speech than he who [says: ""My Lord is Allah (believes in His Oneness),"" and then stands straight (acts upon His Order), and] invites (men) to Allah's (Islamic Monotheism), and does righteous deeds, and says: ""I am one of the Muslims."" (Q.S.41 : 33)"
1,"I feel a better title for this piece would be how to speak powerfully, because there are so many who enjoy listening to gossip. Sometimes exaggerating can make a boring story interesting, so long as it's not to anyone's detriment, what harm? It is in the interest of telling an interesting story."
1,Sorry I don't learn any thing
2,He sounds very wise...

1,"7 sins of speaking:
gossip
judging
negativity
complaining
excuses, not taking responsibility
exaggeration, that can become lying
dogmatism, confusion of facts with opinions

H - honesty, be clear and straight
A - authenticity, be yourself
I - integrity, be your word, trustworthy
L - love, wish people well

Humans prefer voices, that are low(coming from chest), rich, warm, smooth. YOU can train to get there (coach, posture, breathing, exercises).
Change tones, to communicate meanings. Dont use wrong tonality and make it reflect what you are trying to communicate.
Pace
Silence
Pitch - how high
Volume - from  loud to quiet


Exercises:
2X  arms up, deep breath in  -  breath out as arms go down
warm up lips ""ba, ba, ba...""    
lips coming alive ""brrrr"" like kids
tongue exaggerated ""la, la, la, la""
""rrrrrrrrr"" like champagne for the tongue
siren high to low 2x ""oooweeeeaaaw"""

1,ten minutes of words put beautifully together. thank you!
1,"dogmatism.  Literally everything that comes out of democrat mouths.  Endlessly spewing opinions, and if you bring up a fact, even with video proof that a specific person said a specific thing, they disagree bcause that doesn't fit their opinion of that person.  I will admit I am guilty of most things on this list, but I cannot talk to democrats anymore.  Even if I don't know they are a democrat.  I can tell by how they act.  I will often say to people ""you voted for Biden didn't you"".  Because it takes a very specific kind of stupid to actually do that.  There's smart people, average people, and stupid people.  Then there are Biden voters.  Below all 3 categories.  They are the new r e t a rd since we aren't allowed to say that word anymore...because it offends leftists...oh the irony.  Perhaps that's why it offends them, because it describes them so accurately yet goes against their stupid opinion of themselves (that they are actually smart)."

There's nothing wrong with that though, since we couldn't have progress in the world if no one complained about anything. So no, complaining is not just to spread negativity, but is frequently used as a way to instigate a desired change. I get what he was going for, but the terminology is just too broad.

And if you repeat that one, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody, which I think is a shame, so let's try and break that habit.


Pace.


I can get very excited by saying something really quickly, or I can slow right down to emphasize, and at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. It can be very powerful.


Of course, pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? (Higher pitch) Where did you leave my keys? So, slightly different meaning in those two deliveries.


And finally, volume. (Loud) I can get really excited by using volume. Sorry about that, if I startled anybody. Or, I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting,"

Some like to raise their voice at everything and inadvertently driving away any hope for an effective dialogue. Such a shame that the human voice is taken for granted most of the time.
1,"I've been bothered a lot lately with people using their opinions as fact. I was once told to only believe 50% of what you see, 30% of things you read and 0% of what you hear.

1,"My life has been an opposite experience of this. I'm quite natural in the HAIL principles, if I may say so myself. I've found them important almost throughout my life, but for some reasons, people just don't listen to me. I think it's because my voice sucks, my face is not pleasant and/or I am too eager of a talker. Love to talk. Either one or a combination of all of them. 
Sometimes I think I'm TOO honest, TOO authentic and TOO loving so that people think I'm faking it to get praised..but that may be a consequence of their prejudice already against me from the former things. I've seen more beautiful people with better voice that act and talk like me, being listened too attentively & even praised for the things I have been negatively judged for or just tignored...
I think the HAIL works, but only as an extra shift, not as the prime factor.
I'll leave you with my favorite quote:
""The greatest trick of the devil would be to reveal his identity and talk about peace."" (If you don't get it, it's a bit like ""It's not the message that counts, but the messenger."")"

1,"Wow, this really turned out to be boring trash, clickbait that delivered nothing you wouldn’t just know already, except delivered in a clueless example of how not to speak. Definitely started out wrong, with a bunch dreary cliches, then a little better when talking about register, timbre, prosody, pace, silence, pitch, volume, however still dull. We expect better from TED talkers. Merely a bit silly with the voice exercises, would be better for people to free up their expressiveness because they are sincerely communicating something important to them that they want to share out of love for the audience, rather than some mechanical efforts that do not come from the soul. Just a very irritating and useless video really."

1,"I think the negativity thing is bullshit. This is a big reason why nothing gets done, and the fear of being uncomfortable is the main reason people don't listen when you're being ""negative"". A negative thing that is worthy of conversation is obviously something that is important, and is something that needs to be acknowledged. 

I have this problem when speaking about political things that I find interesting and that should be common knowledge, but compromise peoples believes. They are mostly negative as most political issues are if you have an opinion that is different to what a newspaper tells you. But, it is a good indicator for me if someone is worth spending time with, if they feel uncomfortable around negativity then, I will not waste my time with them. People who fear negativity are the kind of people who will bail on you at the first sight of being uncomfortable."

2,a very powerful truth
1,"Negativity, complaining and excuses go hand in hand. I used to complain about everything, I eventually noticed people didn't like to listen to me complain, make excuses and be negative. Now the hardest one for me is Dogmatism, because I've become confident in what I believe about various topics through exhaustive research and discussion. It seems as though most of my beliefs are reinforced with time. Maybe this explains why many old people have strong opinions."

1,"Who is TED and why does he never show up to the talk








Face me, Coward."
1,What about conference calls
1,"While a fine speech, there are some problems I encountered through it that I think would easily be fixed if he gave a bit more time. 

To start, the ‘speaking sins’. The part itself is fine, but he doesn’t go in depth on how it can be stopped. These are habits, and habits are never easy to drop. If you don’t show the way, it seems just odd and gives a dead end feel.

The title itself. I guess it’s better to follow it, but it depends on where you are. Some people might like colder voices, a group of them may like gossiping. While what he said is true and the right thing to do, it is the rarest case. So what he should do is say how to speak well rather than to get people to want to listen.

Includes both be yourself and have a warm voice/certain type of speech. There is not much to say here, so I will just add an example. You can’t make an emo talk with a warm voice or say happy things while also having them be themselves. 



Too Long Didn’t Read: It is overall a good speech but needed more work into it in order to achieve a good inspiration source. He should make it a bit longer. It is worth it as it would fit the title better and make it actually possible for some people.


If you are to provide negative comments, please read it all before you do and provide good points as I might be wrong. I acknowledge it might no be facts and I wish to see mature answers rather than insults."

I excuse myself sometimes.. but more often.. I ask others to forgive me: ""sorry, I'm so sorry""

Lying.. I did that for some time, then I stopped.. I want to be better, to learn.

I usually sound more shy because I try to speak facts.. but I take some time to get my words together


Now... Honesty.. I am an honest person, I try to encourage people but .. be honest with them. Authenticity.. my classmates say I'm random. Although, and I'll say that with experience and my honest opinion: They're assholes. Everyone who's not a part of their  hivemind system is random, unpredictable and all that. In my town, there aren't many people who think on their own. I hate this town, and I don't give in to peer pressure! ""I'm not gonna play fOrTnItE, SIMON!!""
I don't like that game. I don't like competitive games. Integrity... I'm the fact guy.. but I don't have all the facts. Nobody does.. I decide what's best for someone to know. That's not decision, that's logic and honesty.

So why.. is nobody listenin to me? Maybe the last stuff

I leave .. almost no gaps in my sentences.. gotta change that"

This person is really popular and people tend to talk and listen to her more and not gonna lie what she says is alot more interesting (not including myself because i absolutely hated the exaggeration to the point it's the biggest lies ever and it was just constant judgement and gossip about others) Maybe people are clueless maybe they're not, maybe they just avoid akwardness?I swear i questioned myself on this because i thought it was just me thinking like that?.."

1,"I stopped talking ill of people in my late teens after a chat with an older friend who would always preface mentioning another person who wasn't present with ""our good friend"". Even to this day in adulthood I find some folk don't seem to trust me because I won't trade slanderous stories. I feel off kilter when confronted with negative gossip, a feeling I'm happy to have cultivated."

1,"I think the influence of this type of educational/instructional content reduces the person watching into limiting their potential as individuals and of actual worth in society. In a sense because it really instructs people to relegate their interaction with people in life, to 6 simple personality rules.

these people actually think most of our interactions with people are actually consumed by an incentive and instruction to follow only 6 types of responses to people, most people are actually trying to become better versions of themselves...

this generally pisses in the face of most of our recent strides in understanding behavioral psychology and overall moral and theological pushes towards a better, kinder, more scientific, and liberal world...

if not most importantly, it is, it is because it emphasizes relegating your ever-broadening and expanding personality and therefore; increasing positive engagement with an increasingly better off, better advancing, kinder, more loving world."

1,"One small counterpoint: Speaking to the bit on prosody, I see you've taken a jab at up-talk (I'm guessing you're on the side of ""it's ruining our language""), but any linguist worth their salt will tell you that for people who use up-talk regularly, information like question-statement distinctions is coded for in other ways. It's just our linguistic incompetence, as non up-talk users, that prevents us from decoding them."

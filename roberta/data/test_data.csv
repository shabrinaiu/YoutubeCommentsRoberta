0,Complaining is vital to resistance
1,"I always try to avoid to talk gossip, lie etc. cos it’s just a waste of breathe talking about people."
1,"Very interesting ideas, but I do not as I cannot agree with ""judging"".
Each of us along the whole life does nothing more than judging everything and everyone for their doings and decisions, including opinions expressed through statements, as Treasure himself has done before reaching his opinion shown in this video and as the millions of us do in expressing their opinions about it."
1," mmm sorry, I dont do that 'straight' thing"
1,oh Pamtri ! where are you ?????...........
1,"Love how we turn the idiot cows into ""squealing pigs""...and on top of it all he was profess'ing to teaching them how to communicate.

You fucks praise him...oops was I negative."
1,How can I become an inspiring speaker??????? can anybody guide me??

2,Wonderful...great tools .. thank you
2,Amazing loved it.
1,"I got bored and clicked away from this video, and then I returned to mark this irony."
1,"He needs to work on his voice more, he is irritating...And he has a speech impediment."
1,That mic is damn small but give a crystal clear voice output..
1,"Can't believe he demeaned his message to the POWER of lowering your voice & then ""timbre"" IF you're not blessed w/the ability to fake a low voice.  How about BE REAL?  THE MIND IS A MEANDERING OF THOUGHTS & FEELINGS FOR A VERY WIDE VARIETY OF EXPERIENCES & INTERPRETATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN BOILED DOWN TO AN EXPRESSION @ THE MOMENT.  TO ME, FINDING A WAY TO OWN YOUR EXPERIENCE WHILE TRYING TO NOT HARM OTHERS YET ALSO FREELY EXPRESS YOURSELF IS THE ART OF IT.  Well, he's got himself bottled up rather well & working hard to spread the fever.  Sad."
1,Started video i feel I’m in lecture about Islam
1,Gossip: The reason i quit church.
1,"Changing the way you are to have people listening to you when you say something... it's a bit like having a gorgeous actor playing the part of an aesthetically plain looking person in that person's biography in movie form. People have to learn to listen without judging what's not important about them. if someone is giving you the solution to all of your problem, would you not listen to said person because that very person has an ugly spot on her face? Or made a typo? or because you don't like their hairdo, choice in music or whatever? Well, that would be foolish. If everyone changes reality as a means to an end, then we will all have an idea of reality which is pure bullshit. I think there is enough bullshit in this world as it is."
1,His speech is appreciated I think beautiful voice I have ever been listened
2,I was distracted by his magnificently shiny head.
1,Taking this on board. Thankyou
0,People listen and I speak a language the truth a power that scares and offends the stupid..
1,Amazing speech. I was listening this for an assignment but it actually also helped me in real life.
1,Very useful information thanks a lot
1,"thank you for mentioning prosody, I am working on deleting it from my daughter's speech."

2, Pretty sure that guy's dead! LoL
1,"watch a comedian if want to learn about speaking or speach. watch The rock old promos, study your favorite actor in a movie. just a note."
1,"u speaking too fastloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceIm a non-English speaker, Im just trying to imitate you, but I cant do it, cuz he speaking tooo fast FOR me"
1,What was that. I wasn't listening.
1,"Darn, now everyone knows."
1,This is good but so complicated if we do follow these things in real life. Alhumdulillah i thank god the almighty who taught us each and everything thing in a single book a manual to humankind ( Quran) red_heart it’s a remedy for everything to this world and hereafter
2,"Nothing better than having a good moan with friends about the same thing, who doesn' t enjoy that?"
1,"Bullcrap...

People just want to listen to him, because they paid $ 75 to sit in his conference.

Sooooo... You want to do the same moneytalk, heh ?

Yaaaaa !! Bable, bable, brrrr, brrrr, glou-glou... Hail !!
(Now, applause me !)"
1,I was hoping for argument tactics instead of speech-giving techniques. A lot of this isn’t really helpful in a conversation with friends?? What am I gonna do a vocal warmup and practice taking dramatic pauses every time I wanna give someone some advice?
1,am I the only one who chuckled? 
1,Thats an idea worth spreading!
1,"I like how he turned everyone into childs,chickens & trains from "
1,what is dogmatism ?
1, heck!!!!!!smiling_face_with_sunglasses Monotonous never sounded sexier.
1,"When I give speeches, or I am asked for opinion I can usually keep their focus a lot, and watching this video shown me that Im doing most of these things already. That they are built not only in my speech but also character."
2,Best informative Ted talk
1,I am not sure women's voice can go down to the chest register.
1,"I can't even make it to the end of his presentation, I can't stand listening to him that much! Go figure."
1,Basically sounds like he describing a narcissist
2,"Thank you Sir,  I enjoyed your talk and will watch it again."
1,WHY IS HE IN AN OPERA HOUSE TO DO THIS SPEECH!!!!!!!!!!!!
1," This is him!!!
In his young ageface_screaming_in_fearface_screaming_in_fearface_screaming_in_fear"
1,He is so polished!
1,So to sum it all up just be real with others and don't talk s***
1,"Negativity and complaining have their place but, as with anger, they need to be used in moderation. 5.36 talking about tone...
""From the tone of your voice I can tell you mean business"".
The tone of our voice speaks volumes.
I don't do this deliberately but, in my job, if I'm saying something that needs to be heard, I can hear the tone of my voice drop. 
The same when my sons were kids. People make the mistake of raising their voice and this is how arguments start or long silences. 
A deep, even tone, projects confidence and authority. 
Couple that with honesty and integrity and follow up with enthusiasm and love, and you're on to a winner.
This is how dictatorships begin too.
See how readily the audience stood up like obedient children, at his command."

1,"“His To Speak So People Will Listen,”. Stfu stop ignoring me"
1,Also peak a little up and closer to a specific person that isn't listening.
1,now I understand why I cannot listen to MSNBC or CNN
1,Nothing to learn hear it's all in our great holy books like Gita
1,Step 1 : have british / aussy / kiwi accent
1,you can still be the leader of the free world even when you do all these sins.  that's pretty positive....
1,Ir... something contradicts. I'm a negative person and yet in hAil you say A-is Authenticity which is being true to yourself... If I'm true to myself by being negative and basically a downer in life how should I also always be positive when speaking? By faking it? Which is a BIG no no? And vise versa.  I can't be positive while speaking if I'm not being true to myself now can I? This was obviously made for only a sublimest amount of select individuals and I ain't one of them. C.c
1,He proves that everyone listen him.

1,"Hi, I'm here in my backyard. I know how badly yall wanted to see my house i made out of pure knowledge"
1,@ Exactly correct too! Judging is really not good
2,Such a great speech!
1,"Tao Te Ching.  400 y BC. Simple verses. Check latest English translation from Chinese. It has all these advices.  Plainly explained. I am reading just a one page per day,  and keeping this page to myself during the day. Amazing.. 400 bc. Nothing changed much about ppl problems,  issues,  problems and solutions. Advices about talking are included in those verses too."

1,"So you're not talking about a best man's speech then.Anyway, you've got in wrong, appear to be HAIL, and read Atistotle, The Art of Rhetoric."
1,How is it even possible to fall asleep within only  of presentation
1,"Honesty will get you nowhere.  Trump was mostly honest and look where it got him.  Honesty should be on the 1st list.  I'm too honest and watched everyone leave over the years.  I mean, I don't like most people anyway, but I was able to keep them liking me.  The more honest I was, and the less I cared about what they thought, the more they avoided me.  Now there are none (by choice tbh) and I am like 90% happy which is more than most, but my point here...honesty does not go by well with humans.  Maybe a race of higher intellect, but humans are too stupid.  They form opinions based on a) the first thing they hear, and b) based on 1 or 2 variables when there are thousands of variables they don't know....opinions are set in stone. Instantly.  CNN says ""this person did this"".  Bam. They believe it.  Millions of them.  Instantly.  Thousands of unknown variables.  Later that day they hear 5 different people say the opposite of CNN.  Nope.  CNN said it first, little known variables, it is not set in stone in all the little walnut-brained democrats."
1,"Don’t know , what about you?He sounded weird , think he should work on his voice tone and speech and stop saying bad things about how other people speak and present themselves,he’s been watching us and gossiping about us, not nice at all"
1,Dang I do most of them
1,"If you look into what islam and the prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) teaches, all of these qualities form the foundations of his character and what he advises others to also follow. 
Yet when people speak about this on a slideshow with an audience, it all seems to be ground breaking advice and make sense all of a sudden."
1,"""What would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously, consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound? That would be a world that does sound beautiful, and the one where understanding would be the norm and that is an idea worth spreading."" These words caught my attention. INCREDIBLE LECTURE!"

2,"The wise always cherish their blessings.
The more they cherish their blessings,

Bodhisattvas will always be by their side!"
1,"The best part, was when he mentioned gossiping. When you talk badly about someone behind their back, you can undermine your own integrity and make yourself look like a negative person. I have done and still do this occasionally, but I'm trying to do it less and less - and I think it's working. It's not to say that you can never say a bad word about someone, but try to gauge the situation. "
2,Who cares
1,"Thankyou so much, gearing up to speak to someone I'm v scared, but I feel a lot more equipped now, fab"
1,"First step is simple. Get away from the computer, and go out in public.  Then speak."
1,gossiping is a negative habits.
1,"You don't need this much jargon. If people think that they can benefit from listening to you, they will listen to you. Otherwise not. It is that simple"

1,"This is a very helpful talk. When I begin to talk (public speech), I talk clearly but when I reach the middle I talk fast to catch up on my speeding thoughts, your talk has helped me to understand what I need to work on. Thank you Julian for simple explanation."
1,"Awe who cares!!! (joke). Your slant on gossip was wonderful. Somewhere it is written that the tongue is the human body's most dangerous part. Another thing that makes it hard for people to listen, I mean to really HEAR not only the words, but the intent. To do this one must first empty their minds as much as possible. This is called active listening and is, of course, essential to my line of work as a musician. Too often, people are thinking of some comeback, and those ""non-conversations"" are useless exercises in ego battling. One more thing, one of my favorite bits is, ""The loudest person in the room is the most afraid person."""

1,is this a class for mentally deranged?!
1,"While to some degree it has to do with how you perceive yourself, your manner of speaking (are you witty or do you make lame jokes? ....do you speak 'tentatively' or are unsure of yourself or are you confident?....and so on...).  While all of these things can be a factor, another factor is crowd psychology.  If the 'right' people in that crowd like you and/or what you say, or are 'planted' in the audience to clap for you etc,.others, due to crowd psychology, will often find themselves 'liking' you are adding 'weight' to what you say, even though if they were to listen to you 1:1, with no other people around, they may interpret what you say very differently."

1,"Yes I like dis content, Judging dat why people are capable to break d edge so d serpent bite."
2,"Honesty, authenticity, integrity, and love (caring)."
1,"Excellent talk!  It shared many useful and practical techniques that are bound to help anyone.  The content of the message and the quality of the vocal delivery are exceedingly important, but they are not the only mechanisms by which one could entice people to listen.    I've found that there is a hidden amplifying magnet in that tool box that could exact a considerable impact on how willing people would be to listen to what you have to say---especially, when addressing smaller audiences---and that is 'eye contact'.   In an increasingly fast-paced and impatient world, it has become a serious challenge to grab and maintain people's attention long enough to communicate an idea.  The short attention span could be greatly remedied using effective eye contact strategies.  For example, I have tried to deliver the same talk to the same audience with and without effective eye contact and the difference between the two strategies has been quite dramatic.  When you don't establish effective eye contact with your audience, you quickly lose them to the bouts of distraction and impatience."

1,"This video has actually helped me a lot in  personally and professionally. I was not good at communicating before. Facts conveyed by me  to people were false or misleading and they never listen to me. Now, I used these tips  to communicate to people. As a result, people started listening to me and wanted me to talk more on  various topics. "
1,"He says we are not supposed to judge.

1 Timothy  Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.

1 Corinthians 6:3
Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?
H - Honesty...he lied
A - Authenticity, be your self...he's telling you that you need to change. That's not being yourself.
I - Integrity...not a man of his word.
L - Love...the only one he got right.
Seems to me he's the one nobody should be listening to."

1,"""We vote for politicians with lower voices - because we associate depth with power"" ~"
1,I got bored of his speech
1,We need to think about what message we want to communicate mindfully. I used to mindlessly swear (with pride I can say I'm very good at it) but to challenge myself to increase my vocabulary I started to save swearing for expressing feelings and not as emphasizers of a meaningless sentence that will do fine with a different synonym. I ended up advancing both my languages and I ended up being heard way more... ESPECIALLY because now when I do drop a f bomb people feel like seeking cover for the incoming doom because they know I'm enough angry. It feels great to save certain words for a certain moment because otherwise you will lack in expressive power when you really need it.
1,I feel like I do all of them except lying.

0,what's wrong with those people who disliked it?
1,Speaking is one thing but the tone in which you speaks with is of utmost importance. Such a confident and clear speaker: he catches your attn within the first 1 minute with his calm tone and eye contact. Alot to take away. hundred_points

Additionally, it's much easier to speak to others effectively when we take on the role of conscious listener at the forefront. Reciprocity is quite powerful, and we can initiate the standard for effective communication!

Thanks, Julian. God bless!"

1,"This talk is very inspirational to me and I’ll try to adapt it to my life as much as possible! But as a German I’m reading “HAIL” and the definition “to greet or acclaim enthusiastically” and I’m skeptical if that really gets across the right message … I certainly don’t want to see people enthusiastically acclaiming somebody and shouting “HAIL” in the streets again. Maybe this acronym needs some work? How about reversing the letters and … well, that’s not much better, either. “Hila” sounds nice"
1,"How to speak so others listen? How about, Hey morons, listen up? But, that still won't help. Most don't even acknowledge others that make points to prove ignorance in others. Like, stupid people do not know they are stupid."

1,"i think the techniques he covered in this video is good for when you are giving important talks and you want the other to pay attention. gossiping and complaining and such are sometimes used as tools to bond with others and deepen relationships. speaking as a girl, i know gossiping definitely constituted a big portion to reason why i bonded with some of my closest girl friends.(not saying this is good, but this is how it's done for most people i think)"

1,"People may still not talk to you after you follow all these steps, but I truly think that, beside trying to make people listen, you just feel better about yourself. Ask yourself, isn't it more pleasing to listen to a calm, slow paced voice, rather than a highpiched, fast paced voice? Even if people don't talk to you that much, is better to know that the little words you spoke to them made them feel safe around you."

Someone not listening to you is a reflection of themselves not the person talking. Not to say you shouldn't follow his advice, just saying not doing those things and doing what he suggests wont make people want to or not want to listen to you more or less."

I roughly knew about these points and steps already through my social surrounding and own experience...BUT I often feel bad for being this confident while speaking in this here described way...meaning I sometimes get the feeling that I intimidate the other person or persons with my self confident appearence.

So my question might be: Have any of you experienced something like this? Either from my perspective OR from the perspective of my here described counterpart. 
Or also have an answer on how to handle these situations and feelings i get.

1,I do not like how speaks poorly of judgement without giving any explanation of what judgment even is.

1,"I always wondered why others desperately wanted to sell their ideas, while I was just desperately to sell reality; i was searching every waking moment, and they had stopped searching ages ago. Then I wondered why they laughed at me. Later I learned why they did, as it came across my analysis. And now, no one wants to sell their ideas to me anymore, so it got a little lonely.
Maybe if you walk away from all this 'selling', it will be quiet."

1,Ironic that this is about listening and there is a man sleeping in the audience at .
2,"Thank you, this is really helpful :D "
2,Was great speech and made sense until the warm up weeeeeew part. . Ridiculous !
1,"The human voice: It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world, probably. It's the only one that can start a war or say ""I love you."" And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people don't listen to them. And why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world? What I'd like to suggest, there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list, but these seven, I think, are pretty large habits that we can all fall into. First, gossip. Speaking ill of somebody who's not present. Not a nice habit, and we know perfectly well the person gossiping, five minutes later, will be gossiping about us. Second, judging. We know people who are like this in conversation, and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time. Third, negativity. You can fall into this. My mother, in the last years of her life, became very negative, and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her, ""It's October 1 today,"" and she said, ""I know, isn't it dreadful?"" (Laughter) It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative. (Laughter) And another form of negativity, complaining. Well, this is the national art of the U.K. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather, sport, about politics, about everything, but actually, complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blamethrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions, and again, hard to listen to somebody who is being like that. Penultimate, the sixth of the seven, embroidery, exaggeration. It demeans our language, actually, sometimes. For example, if I see something that really is awesome, what do I call it? (Laughter) And then, of course, this exaggeration becomes lying, and we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us. And finally, dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind. You know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are, seven deadly sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones, foundations, that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is ""hail,"" and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is how I think our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The H, honesty, of course, being true in what you say, being straight and clear. The A is authenticity, just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity, being your word, actually doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people well, for two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously. So hail. Also, now that's what you say, and it's like the old song, it is what you say, it's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible, and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with, which will increase the power of your speaking. Register, for example. Now, falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice, however. So if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference? We vote for politicians with lower voices, it's true, because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's register. Then we have timbre. It's the way your voice feels. Again, the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well if that's not you, that's not the end of the world, because you can train. Go and get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture, and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice. Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing-song, the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word ""monotonic"" comes from, or monotonous, monotone. Also, we have repetitive prosody now coming in, where every sentence ends as if it were a question when it's actually not a question, it's a statement? (Laughter) And if you repeat that one, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody, which I think is a shame, so let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very excited by saying something really quickly, or I can slow right down to emphasize, and at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. It can be very powerful. Of course, pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? (Higher pitch) Where did you leave my keys? So, slightly different meaning in those two deliveries. And finally, volume. (Loud) I can get really excited by using volume. Sorry about that, if I startled anybody. Or, I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting, (Laughter) Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice. Of course, where this all comes into play most of all is when you've got something really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing marriage, asking for a raise, a wedding speech. Whatever it is, if it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on, and no engine works well without being warmed up. Warm up your voice. Actually, let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do. Any time you're going to talk to anybody important, do these. First, arms up, deep breath in, and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that. One more time. Ahhhh, very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips, and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good. And now, brrrrrrrrrr, just like when you were a kid. Brrrr. Now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. Beautiful. You're getting really good at this. And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally, and if I can only do one, the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts with ""we"" and goes to ""aw."" The ""we"" is high, the ""aw"" is low. So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww. Fantastic. Give yourselves a round of applause. Take a seat, thank you. (Applause) Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well to people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics. I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were actually fit for purpose? Or to make that a bit larger, what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound? That would be a world that does sound beautiful, and one where understanding would be the norm, and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you. (Applause)"

• negative communication is bad!!! Seriously do not focus on things that are wrong. If you get cut off or sometime mows grass into your side don’t bother with that garbage. It’s nothing but a distracting. 
Even if your coworker complains about something. Do not drag on the conversation. Replay short and simple. 
Just move on to things that are coming in the future! Past is gone.

Also don’t be too concerned to much with how your voice sounds. Just speak clearly and to the point. That will cover 95% of everyday life"

1,Actually I have improved a lot by this video
1,"Uh, NOPE.  I have used register, timbre,  pace, pitch, gesticulation, elocution, and elucidation consistently, and do so effectively, because I have a background in theatre.

  I have functioned this way for my entire adult life, and absolutely no one listens to me until I'm consciously trying to manipulate or dominating them, OR am threatening,  in some capacity. Absolutely NOTHING else works."
2,I like how he speaks better than the usual ted feminist.
1,Can't preach something that you yourself aren't even good at

1,one of the bestred_heart
1,"Wow, I learned from this video how to deliver a powerful speech. The six elements you mentioned, 'Fegister, Timbre, Prosody, Pace, Pitch, Volume' for effective speaking were really impressed for me. Your presentation was both informative and incredibly engaging because of your talking skills. After watching this speech, I feel confident that I, too, can deliver compelling and captivating speeches like you. I'm looking forward to watch you on your next video. Have a good day!"
1,My only concern with silence is that so many people take even a nanosecond's worth to jump in and interrupt. I honestly don't understand why they are so desperate to talk.

1,"This isn't meant to be political but rather an example that contradicts this Ted talk.  I am really fascinated by the fact that Donald Trump has the ability to speak ill of others, complain, whine, lie profusely, brag, etc, and still be able to get an audience to listen and actually believe every word that he says.  To me, if I had to have a conversation with him, I would have to find a reason to leave.  Just an observation on my part."
1,Is this in the Lyceum in Edinburgh? Think I recognise those chairs.
1,that last sentence !
1,Hello. how can i participate to a Ted Talk?
1,"Very interesting... I agree if that is what people want to do in their lives, if their job depends on it. Not if you all are different. Do you know why we say ""I like/love you?"" because we´re all different from each other,  and what you are saying is that, for me to be listen I need (for example) a smooth voice... If all of us had a smooth voice, just like chocolate, we would be all the same and the meaning of ""I like you"" would love all sense. You like because I'm different. I'll never change my voice or the way I dress to please society. Being different is good and we should respected. Of course I agree whit Julian whit the word HAIL, your being yourself. I just don´t like to see people change for society. We should change it and not be changed. E o mundo é bonito com o sua diversidade."

But SORRY I DIDN'T LISTEN TO HIM grinning_face_with_sweat"
1,Did anyone know that I have to learn each and every line of the speech because of my school listening and speaking activity
1,"I hate how busy with noise some places are (the register at my local burger shop due to proximity to the open kitchen comes to mind, or the registers at the grocery store).  The worst is when you are in such a place, and the person speaking to you doesnt speak loudly or clearly enough (some, even despite my telling them I have hearing problems, or repeatedly asking them to repeat themselves).  This is esp true for me, as I am visually impaired and can no longer read lips.  My mother used to have this saying ""Sorry, I cant hear you, I dont have my glasses on""-which sounds funny, but refers to lip reading.  Most people dont even realize they are doing it, its so ingrained."
1,"""Are you calling me fat?"" ""No. Fat is a judgement word. I am saying that I care about you and I want you to be healthy."""

2,One of the best
1,"I found that rather good and funny.
I think people have began to listen to me now that i'm older but as a kid and teen they didn't at all. And one day in school we had to make a tape and we played them back and i found my voice so annoying i was like no wonder people don't like me if thats how i talk I wouldn't want to be my friend either."
0,"who do I do when I am a gossiping, judgemental, negative complainer?"
1,"So, this guy seems to be plagiarizing a portion of the Bible as though it were his ideas or something novel."
1,I’m guilty of all of these. Omg
2,No one cares about honesty anymore.  People are more likely to believe lies than the truth.
2,Thank you for the inspiring messagefolded_handssmiling_face_with_smiling_eyes
1,"""Where understanding would be the norm"" - that last sentence is fantastic"
2,"Too sweet, too idealist, not at all realistic. Might as well say, ""Too rid the world of all wars once and for all, we should all love each other.""  Duh."
2,Great! But make sure that cannot be done based on a lie such as religion
1,Of course it could just be that people want to do the talking themselves rather than let someone else speak.
1,"With 34 million views, I figure a lot of people listened to him and he knows what he's talking about."

1,"I would add another deadly sin - interrupting.  It is culturally determined, but a huge no-no in the USA."
1,This is a gem!
1,"avoid these features:
gossip - builds distrust and discomfort; if you can talk about one you can talk about anyone (talk well about somebody only, or nothing at all?)
judging - its hard to talk when you feel judged
negativity - its hard to listen to negativity; it just pulls you down too
complaining - perpetuates misery
excuses - avoiding responsibility; feels dishonest and untrustworthy
exaggeration - takes away genuity of language; feels dishonest and boring
dogmatism - treating your own opinions as truth; hard to open up genuine debate/changing and understanding of beliefs; seems closed and unapproachable

speak with these intentions:
honesty - be clear and straight; accept the consequences
authenticity - be yourself; dont hide what you really feel
integrity - keep promises; to become dependable
love - wish your conversational partner well; only want them to make the best decision and succeed; you cant judge when you love

change these to change nuance:
register - where your voice comes from; nose, throat, chest, stomach
timbre - how your voice feels; soft, smooth, scratchy, grating
prosody - the rhythm and tone of your speech; flat, multideminsional, up, down
pace - the speed of your speech; fast, slow
pitch - the height of your speech; high, low
volume - the size of your speech; high, low of your speech; fast, slow
pitch - the height of your speech; high, low
volume - the size of your speech; high, low"

1,"wow, this video is so useful and necessary for me because I really am not well at speaking, especially when talking to others. Well, I don't know maybe I don't use the toolbox of the voice that he says or I really don't have anything to say to my friend as they always talk about frivolous that I don't care about them, oh, that likes to gossip. Hmm, I can't be sure but I will learn how to improve my speech by changing timbre and tone of voice to be more confident when I speak in public."

1,And this is why Morgan Freeman is so well known and sought after even for narration past 20 years.
1,"I am retired and now volunteer as a public speaker in a historic building. Before I retired I was in aviation safety counseling. I had to speak to pilots about safety. I have been speaking in public for well over 40 years. Today my historic tours are my pride and joy. I use about 90% of what was just said. I do not do the voice exercises because I work at the information desk between tours, so I am constantly speaking. One thing I think most people don't do is to break the talk into segments add a little humor into the talk. Time yourself, don't go on and on, most peoples attention span is about 20 minutes. Ask if there are any questions at the end of the talk not during the talk. I ask after each segment."
0,"1 more thing 
Don’t be boring"
1,what was he talking about ?
1,that's so weird how he made all of these people do this kind of  crazy exercise that they wouldn't of done anywhere else or for whatever reason or even for there own children
1,Varys is that you?
1,"An antithesis of his argument of ""judging, complaining, negativity, and exaggeration/dogmatism "" are all qualities that we do not like to hear...  George Carlin embodies all these qualities and successfully delivers contemporary comedic social commentary . 

One could argue, George incorporates all these techniques from HAIL, but if it is true, hypothetically you can use HAIL, you can speak about anything even in a negative manner, exaggerated manner, or with dogmatism."

1,"Julian is direct and brings back a lost art!  Comments listed below must be from the ""what can you give me today"" generation.  Listening and communicating effectively is a skill and it is apparent that each of you know how to bully, judge, complain and be negative. Congratulations!"

1,"- The human voice is a powerful instrument capable of influencing change, but many struggle to make people listen when they speak.
- 7 deadly sins of speaking: gossip, judging, negativity, complaining, excuses, embroidery (exaggeration), and dogmatism.
- To make speech powerful and impactful, Treasure suggests embracing the ""HAIL"" principles: Honesty, Authenticity, Integrity, and Love.
- Tools for improving speech, including register, timbre, prosody, pace, pitch, and volume."

1,"Conversation and speaking is truly an intricate art. The mastery of it takes discipline composure and consistency, among many other things. I now take every single interaction I have, whether it be a physical interaction or via any digital format text messaging, etc. I take it as a test for myself every time. I then rate my conversion based on how well I applied this great information to work on all my weaknesses each time I strive to do better than my last interaction. How to correctly apply this information is key. Thank you for sharing this information with us all. To anyone reading this comment, I really do wish you all the best.

1,"Wow that's well said, it is productive  even if its just  10 minutes presentation.Through a friendly tone, a personal question, or simply a smile, he have encouraged his listeners to engage in open and honest communication with everyone. It is important to be confident in your interactions with others. Confidence shows your listeners that you believe in what you’re saying and will follow you through. Exuding confidence can be as simple as making eye contact or using a firm but friendly tone.

2,found a new relief. Thank you Ted.
1,I wonder how this fellow would explain the election of Donald Trump. All Trump seems to have is a bit of authenticity. He is not honest nor does he possess much integrity. The only person he really loves is himself. Yet he managed to persuade a lot of people to vote for him. So whatever he is doing seems to work on that dimension.
1,he speaks so well..err err um um ah ah gets so exhausting to listen to
2,"if you a stutter, good luck."
1,"This speech reminded me once again.
Things I missed and made mistakes when I was speaking.
It even made me aware of things I didn't think of.

1,"Oi, as I frustratingly struggled to keep from furrowing my brows while simultaneously attempting to locate that crucial but missing body-part, notably a penis,  on my female body, I made it barely through ""Embellishment""(which I refer to in TrumpsterAmerica as Absurd-Hyperbole) holding back giggling,  before I completely lost it guffawing as I delved into-  ""Dogmatism"" , it's numerous sub-categories, my favorite- 'Lying'.  In a word, to describe my confusion,  ""incredulity"".  To be fair and respectful to the Speaker,  I put it on  ""Hold"" to check the date - I always assume that everything is current.   Ah, 6/2014, right, Situation Aware  (B.A.D).    Our Speaker is describing truisms, his list of many points are accurate, albeit most of them based upon his personal experiences holding conversations in non-USA countries with mature adults. Viewing the date then comparing it with today's 8/12/19  New World Order  in  TrumpsterAmerica,  I'd been  comparing it to *my* personal  experience : The inability to hold *any* sensible conversation with a Red Hat.  In fact , *finding* a mature adult, holding a sensible conversation with any of them,  finishing an entire  sentence without being personally  insulted,  is the equivalent of Finding Waldo- ain't gonna happen, Waldo is in Deep undercover.  My bad for not checking the date as there is no *way* this lecture would have made sense at a Trumpster Rally (he used multi-syllabic words) or for that matter, at any gathering:  Not in in 2019 TrumpsterAmerica, nor in BrexitEngland,  nor in parts of Australia, Venezuela, or for that matter, I can't think of any place on earth this would hold water in our Current World Order.  Think back to  Pre- WWI, Pre-WWII , listen again, listen to Putin, Dump, KJU and you'll understand my confusion - It's not Julian Treasure's error, it's mine."

1,Sadly I disagree with most of what he says. Any one who has worked for a corporate company knows what I am saying. If you want to climb the corporate ladder you need to know how to BS your way to the top. A sad & harsh truth that a majority of those at the top are liars. A prime example is the fraud who calls himself the president.

1,"Great points ... but what about looking at it from the other side ... why do people focus on the sensorial, emotional or political aspects of people speaking, and not on the informational content of what is being said.

There is an expression, ""out of the mouths of babes"", meaning sometimes the person least likely for anyone to listen to or care about says the most amazing thing.  I think we have to be trained, or somehow motivated, or conditioned to focus on what our societies want us to listen to as a method of indoctrination or control.

Isn't it also our duty as people, as listeners and participants in life to listen to what people say and judge it based on what the person says and not cater to what is really a defect in our listening system, a vestige of a political system that comes from when we could not talk or think at all????????"

Btw: Have you ever wondered how many great non-english stuff is lost somewhere in the Internet, only because it was made in some national language instead of english?"

1,who gave a buzzfeed list a ted talk?
1,"Not a great speech to be honest. He delivers way too much info in only ten minutes. He talks about 7 sins, then discusses 5 more things (HAIL), and continues with 6 toolbox concepts.

I guarantee you most of the people in the audience as well as youtube viewers aren't going to remember much five minutes later."
1,"i’m female with quite a rich, deep voice so hearing “we associate deep voices with power” gave me so much confidence haha"

copied Yunhua Chaanng's comment)


Avoid:
1. Gossip
2. Judging
3. Negativity
4. Complaining
5. Excuses
6. Lying
7. Dogmatism

HAIL - To greet or acclaim enthusiastically
H - Honestly (Be straight and clear)
A - Authenticity (Be yourself)
I - Integrity (Be your word)
L - Love (wish them well)

Amazing Toolbox:
1. Register - Locate your voice at your chest to gain some weight
2. Timbre - Voices that are rich, smooth and warm
3. Prosody - Avoid monotone, a statement sounds like a question and repeat a statement
4. Pace - Get excited by saying something really quickly;  Slow down to emphasize; Silent
5. Pitch- Ex: ""Where did you leave my keys?"" with different pitches, are different meaning
6. Volume: Excited - High Volume; Attention - Low Volume

Warm up your voice
1. Arms up, deep breath in and sigh out
2, 3. Warm up the lips: Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba...; Brrrrr.......
4, 5. Tongue warm up: La, la, la, la, la....; Rrrrrr.....
6. WeeeeeeeeeAaaaawwww (From high pitch to low pitch)"

1,"I believe that if there was a top of the most exciting TED videos, this one would probably be the first.

Sometimes I catch myself thinking that I'm not being listened to. Wondering why it happens I was getting doubt about my own ideas and their use. But this man made things clear. He helped me realize that the voice, our powerful instrument, is likely not being used as it should be. Following his simple advices in my daily life made me speak my mind distinctly. This feeling is amazing.
Thank you so much."

1,"The way my social studies teacher described the ubermensch was someone who has an importance about them; even though it is maybe not always shown. Speaking so that people listen ties right into that. Certain people (we all know at least one), demand to be listened to just by being present. They can be super outspoken or maybe even very timid, either way, their presence demands attention. Every word that comes out of that person's mouth is complete gold. But yet, we have people on the complete opposite side of the spectrum. The people that talk but nobody listens. The sad part is, a lot of the time, we put the people who SHOULD be heard at the bottom and the pointless one's on top.  My teacher pulled me out of class and tried explaining to me that I am one of these people that demands to be heard and that I should use it to my advantage.  I am very advanced philosophically for my age and I feel I can not speak to anyone In my school on a more advanced level than average High School student talk.  I have never really considered myself special in any way, and I feel Everyone should be treated with great respect, except I have found myself to be quite manipulative.  I can catch myself at a random time in the day persuading someone to do something (go get me some tape or something) that I would never do for someone else and they wouldn't do for someone else simply because It's not worth it.  But, for whatever reason, they still do it for me.  Now this raises the question ""Am I different or special?"", I do NOT consider myself better than anyone else! That is absolutely crazy to think that one is better than another just because of their traits. I have also realized that I have never gotten bullied In my life (although there is a lot of reasons to), and I have never wanted to bully anyone or see anyone get bullied. I always strive to make my community a better place and make myself and the others around me happy. If you have read this entire impromptu essay, Kudos to you. I feel like I needed to write this somewhere.Thanks."

Sometimes i am put in a group with caucasians (not blaming caucasian race here) but most of them don't listen to what i have to say and it makes me anxious to say anything else since they don't listen to my previous opinion. And I can tell you that I'm always avoiding Gossip, Judging, Negativity, Complaining, Excuses, Lying, Dogmatism and I follow the other things as well. I was thinking that maybe since I'm a 5'2 Asian girl that they don't listen to me? Does it has anything to do with race? Perhaps?"

1,"Gossip is the cornerstone of our social interactions. contrasting with Serious Talk. If you can't gossip you can't be a social person, because your listeners will be very few. That's a sad fact.

Also the HAIL words depends on the other party's reception of you. They can view you as a dishonest and hater even if you try your hardest to show them otherwise. You can put on a false appearance and say to them what they want to hear. That's what politicians do for work. 100% Honest people are always ignored and casted away by society"

Julián, I want to make a criticism that may seem unpleasant, but it is not.  The desire to understand you better leads me to this, since what you say is very important and useful:

 You speak too fast, especially at first, and it's impossible to follow the subtitles.

 We are millions of people who do not speak English, and not because of a lack of will, but because your syntax is contrary to that of many other languages.  I express it by saying that ""my brain does not know how to think on the left.""

 On the other hand, and I think you are talking about it, when there is too much enthusiasm, I have the sensation of listening to a football match on the radio, where the announcer believes that he transmits passion and I, the only thing I receive is stress and pollution acoustics.

 You say fantastic things that he had never noticed.  If you can add a calmer continent to this content, thinking of the thousands of people who can only understand you by fully reading the subtitles, this video will be wonderful.

 At the moment, and this is just my opinion, it's a bit daunting, since for each line of subtitles, I have to press pause to read the translation.

 I assure you that if you speak more slowly, we will still listen to you, since we need a lot of re-education in public speaking!

 Thank you huge.

1,"I learned a while ago that most people don't really listen to what a person has to say. Speakers with either natural or trained voice dynamics can say complete bullcrap and people will swallow it. How things are said change the way the content is understood. Even if somebody says the most fascinating things in the world, but with a dull voice, he won't be listened by most. People assume that dull voice comes from a person who doesn't believe what he's saying, so any message is lost."

1,"For such an expert, he's rather monotone and easy to fall asleep to. Then again, its one thing to be an expert study on a matter and another to be a natural talent. For excellent delivery, see Chris Harris in his automotive reviews."
1,"Do I feel like people aren't listening? As a speaker, coach, and educator, very rarely because I'm passionate, intelligent, ethical, well-informed, and just damn funny. You've GOT to use humor, but be honest and ethical most of all. Read Stephen Covey talk about the character ethic. But I'm also 6' 5"" 250 with a big, bass voice. That helps. And I use great variety in my delivery. People get bored quickly. Pace of voice, delivery, and content is key. I also use silence A LOT! Want people to pay attention? STOP! Yup, you've got 'em. But I think the biggest thing is to be positive, realistic, down to earth, but don't lecture too much too often. People don't want to hear it. But if you've GOT to do it, connect to the people first, humor is key here. Show them that you're real and bleed too. If people like you, they'll listen to most of what you have to say, as long as it's not overtly nasty. Good luck."

1,"Awesome speech and well performed. However the title is a little irritating, since the seven deadly sins listed usually grab people's attention really quickly. ^^ People tend to always listen up when gossip is involved; negativity, judging and dogmatism are used to manipulate people from their earliest days (Julian's lucky his mother only became negative in her later years instead of her whole life through) and sadly they work very effectively on the majority of people. It would have been important to point out that those sins are instruments to force people to listen through inducing fear, while the suggestions he presented are the better means for a more agreeable communication."

1,"I'm a voice and speech coach. I know he only spoke for 10 minutes but he tried to pack everything in there. A few things. His ""rules"" are intended for his culture and the western culture in general. It is a fact that many cultures in the world don't value honesty as we do, and lying is quite acceptable and common. In his warm-ups with LA LA LA LA - he displayed an incredible amount of jaw movement and tension which doesn't. Incorrect. He didn't explain that the lip motions involve trills and bubbles. One is voiced and the other is unvoiced. He demonstrated 3 places for the voice to be placed and not a word on how to do that. I am not commenting just to criticise. Just to point out you shouldn't place all your methods and belief in one talk such as this, and there is a wonderful, whole world of things to be aware of when it comes to verbal communication and how to do it well.  While he opened the door to some things involved in speaking, I would have covered fewer topics in more depth, rather than throwing a large laundry list of things out there. Don't let this confuse or overwhelm you."

1,Will try the voice warm ups. Before shooting videos. Informative
1,"Here are 2 knowledge objects extracted from the content:

### Title: The power of the human voice

- Fact: The human voice is a powerful instrument that can influence others.

- Situation: Many people feel their voice is not listened to or impactful. 

- Cause: People fall into habits like gossiping, judging, negativity, complaining, making excuses, exaggerating, and dogmatism that make their voice less powerful.

- Approach: To speak powerfully, stand on the foundations of honesty, authenticity, integrity, and love. Speak with warmth, positivity, and care for the listener.

### Title: Vocal warmups enhance public speaking

- Fact: Warming up your voice properly before public speaking improves performance.

- Situation: Many speakers don't warm up their voice before important talks.

- Cause: Speakers are unaware of simple vocal warm-up exercises. 

- Approach: Do vocal warm-ups before public speaking including deep breathing, lip trills, tongue rolls, and sirens to enhance your voice."
1,I think that guy at  is asleep.
1,I came in with the mindset like if he makes me wanna listen ill trust what he’s saying.
1,This is genius.
1,The non judge mental philosophy is insane and dangerous and is promoted by those who are either brainwashed or who want to keep an unjust system.  You wouldn’t speak to a child molester and not judge. You wouldn’t speak to a rapist and or judge. We judge constantly. That’s all we do and that’s how we survive. But you have to know how to judge correctly.

1,"Called bullshit at . A lot of the stuff at the beginning made sense, and because it does an intelligent speaker would (not) do those things instinctively. Why would I care whether or not the ignorant and uncomprehending masses are listening when I speak? I might in fact care, carelessly like when I speak to a dog or cat or a small child but that's quite different from taking the notion that you can persuade people who are committed to not thinking to somehow do so by rhetoric or other jacking."

1,"I love this speech so much that I’m using it for an out of state declamation tournament

Edit: I got second place overall with itsmiling_face_with_sunglasses"
1,"Try watching portuguese TV or politicians doing speeches. It's absolutely *INSUFFERABLE...* Apart from *some* show hosts, most of the time it's like:
- 65% _""aaahh""_ and _""eeerrr""_
- 34.9% pretensions words, filler and redundant adverbs
- 0.1% actual content.

I always have trouble following them. When I watch any TV, that is 

One time I was zapping and came across a guy starting to respond to a news reporter's question, and I had the insight to look at the time. It took him two minutes to make his response, and by then I though _""I've no f... clue what this guy just said.""_ So I rewinded it and played it again, pausing to assimilate and filter out all the useless crap, and in the end I assembled his response in around 6-8 words, and voiced it within 3 seconds..."
2,Absolutely great talk.
1,"Pretty much don't be a toxic minded person, have integrity, have confidence, and know the power of emphasis, pace, and clarity."
1,"Albeit this sounds good in theory, however, quite the converse of each of these is true for Trump. Each of the negative has worked quite well for him.  I would have believed this prior to the 2016 presidential campaign. 


 1. Gossip
2. Judging
3. Negativity
4. Complaining
5. Excuses
6. Lying
7. Dogmatism"
1,"I think this is The Best Video for The Ted talks.... Hat's off u guys, u are really The Lifesavers saluting_facesaluting_facesaluting_facesaluting_face"
1,"8yrs ago this guy said ""standing in your own truth"" and no one brow beat him about being 'woke'."
1,"This is bullshit. You know how i know this is bullshit? Donald Trump. This man does all of the 7 sins. Yet he's the president of the United States of America.

Gossip: This man is known to talk about other people when they're not around. He did it in his TV show and White House Insiders leaked how talks about other people.

Judging: This man made his money off of judging. Miss America. The Apprentice. How he talks about women and minorities.

Negativity: He literally had nothing good to say about The United States of America. NOTHING. His whole campaign was Make America Great Again.

Complaining: When does this man not complain? He complained on the campaign trail. He complained his first few months in the White House.

Excuses: I'm honestly starting to repeat myself. When he thought he was losing he accused the Election of being Rigged Against Him. He had excuses to why he didn't repeal Obamacare. Why he couldn't build a wall. He makes a lot of excuses.

Lying: again i feel like all of my examples are repeats. He lied during the campaign. He lies Right Fucking Now. He's lying as i type this! He's known to be a compulsive lier.

Dogmatism: Just read everything above honestly. Everything i said he did because he didn't get his way. When ever he doesn't get his way he attacks people, which isn't a bad strategy tbh it's honestly the fucking point of politics but it still shows Dogmatism.

Donald Trump is the embodiment of someone people don't listen to YET millions of US citizens cheer him as the best thing since sliced bread.

Therefore this Ted talk is bullshit."
1,I love how youtube recommends me an old woman sings Hey Jude with little dog yesterday and Ted talk today.
1,Lot of difference between British & American English!
1,"I wanted to listen to ""how to speak"" subject but this man talks and now its boring. I dont think i can learn anything about that from a man who cant catch my attention."
2,God bless you Mr.Julian.

Gotta stop complaining..."

1,"“The ability to speak does not make you intelligent.”

1,this speech made me speechless :D
1,When you do a talk about talking.. he's proved a lot there in less than 10 minutes
1,incredible
1,Wonder if he's ever listened to President Donald Trump...He's impossible to listen to..
1,"Thank you Julian - very informative - but we also need to understand another main point of concern on a lighter note - AND ALWAYS REMEMBER - ""What good is your point of view when no one really wants to listen"" - cheers"
1,How to speak so that people want to listen : Go bald!
1,Should probably be included in the curriculum.
0,avoid 7: gossip judging negativity complaining excuses lying dogmatism
1,Powerful is he//she who master the art of listening
1,This talk proves he is very much incorrect. My example is Donald Trump.
1,"Tomorrow, i have to do a presentation in front of many people. I think i’m so lucky person because, i watched this video before presentation:)"
1,"Julian Treasure has simply addressed the matter of human voice, voicing and sound precisely to the point. I am a voice artist and I must say that he is certainly a genious."
1,I ironically found this not so captivating.
1,where was this talk held
1,Make em believe that they may make lot’s of money out of itman_gesturing_OK
1,H.A.I.L. being yourself
1,He's excellent at what he teaches! Interesting to know how so many actions of ours which are have no apparent connection to sound are in reality based off of our perception of it! 
1,"Ouch, this hit hard. Cancer took more tissue than I cared to lose, i.e. what is left of my laryngeal area no longer can attain anything close to ""Rich, Smooth, Warm, like hot chocolate"". Instead, I sound angry now all the time, even when trying talk to a kitten. Communication breakdown is hardcore. Truly great communication requires voice, hard to learn that."
1,Donald Trump literally violates all of these rules.
1,"Negative Point: This guy is expounding the ultimate in Machiavellian behaviour; telling you to cynically tailor your output to manipulate others, all while doing it himself to a responsive audience. 
Personally I prefer REAL people, with REAL opinions, not groomed manikins. Lets face it, he's so busy practising his skills of manipulation you don't know what he really thinks. He's not being guided by his real thoughts and feelings, he's prepared (or playing out) scripted behaviour and content. I'm sure Ted Bundy was just as charming if you see what I mean? Or even Adolph Hitler!! Surely he broke ALL the rules expressed here yet he carried millions with him! 
Of course, I'm only expressing an opinion here, but at least you know where I'm coming from. Can't say I know anything about him as a real person, but like all these people he occasionally dresses in all black and probably has plastic teeth ;-)"
2,just brilliant and so true. many messages in this video
1,"He didn't mention using your hands (and body language ) which is too important to miss, but i guess i'm being negative. =/"
1,Wow!  https://energyelephant.com will be taking these learnings to heart!

to others. It's like I'm scolding myself here lol."
2,Really impressing!
1,Truly incredible.
2,Is complimenting judging?
2,"in summary be a good positive person, and i would add listening to others yourself would be a great message as well"

2,A foot = 6”. Lmao
1,"Despite this video is a bit short, I felt the contents is really helpful for improving how to talk for others."
1,I learned nothing I just liked listening to him face_with_tears_of_joy
1,"I don't know, there's quite a bit in here I don't relate to. For example, I feel that negativity and complaining actually can be a good way of bonding with people if you for instance both feel negative towards the same thing (if you both dislike a certain food, music, tv show, anything really). Meanwhile, someone who is overly positive and nice, I would sometimes just find them fake and annoying to a certain degree."
2,"Why are rant channels so popular, then?"
1,"And this is why being a whistleblower, or complaining about a toxic workplace culture gets you nowhere.  You are seen as a gossip, a troublemaker, negative, judgmental, loser that just doesn't fit in. If you are in a toxic workplace the only option is to leave because no one will listen to you."
2,This is excellent!!

1,"This brightened my day a bit. Been behaving in this exact manner for years.... Feeling like I was the only one the whole time maybe might have gotten me a bit depressed. Now I can only manage to get cigarettes, hold the door open before I go in the gas station, truly wish the cashier that they have a good day, and walk back to my apartment to sleep. That cashier has such a wonderful smile lately. I hope that it's because of my genuine acts of kindness....Yet it feels like an egotistical assumption. And that's not going to keep her smiling. Is it wrong to maybe know for sure her smile is so bright because I am doing my part to be the change I wish to see in the world....if I am kind of needing validation so that I keep upholding these mannerisms? Does that veil my behavior with deception of some sort...? So lost... -.-"
1,A SUPER-DUPER PERSON! Let such people be everywhereraised_fist
1,I need to work on my negative should be reduced to just wake people from the la la land. I used to be one of those optimistic la la land guys too just that I am always the one that needs to explain the negative impact of a solution/issue. or the positives from the failure of a project. but people are afraid of me telling them a negative outcome to anything but they love the positive light I shine for them in their journey through the dark tunnel. Knowing means you can prepare and lessens the impact of an outcome and back to your happy self.

1,"What if people can’t stand the truth?  (TRUMP Voters, cult members, incompetent CEO’s, etc...) What if people and even entire societies have built their ENTIRE existence around dogmatism? (Religion) What if people are actually more popular and actually move higher up in an organization by engaging in occasional gossiping? (This is a researched fact).  What if complaining actually releases stress and decreases cortisol levels? (Also another TED talk).  What if it isn’t words, but actions that determine whether or not people will “listen” to you?  What if there were TED talks that offered almost no research to back up their claims, but instead had people making absurd animal noises because of mindless group-think?   What if the pulp-TED talks people came up with were nothing more than marketing stunts to gain views /clickbait to further their business interests and “consulting” speaker fees?  Hmmmm... what if?

1,"The speaker had effectively used verbal and nonverbal communication in delivering his message. In using verbal communication, he was very concise or straight to the point in conveying his message and he implied the use of simple and specific words to express his ideas because he focused only on a single objective in his speech. In utilizing nonverbal communication, the speaker had demonstrated a friendly tone that will make him look approachable and built a rapport with his audience. He also maintained an eye contact with his audience to know that his attention is really focused on them and the message itself.

1,"Persuasion techniques - are quite essential for everybody without any exceptions. Nowadays I higly appreciate my father's and his collegue's lessons of negatiation held for nearly 10 of my peers and me, which helped us to get skills of persuasion, a proper dialogue and positive relationship with our relatives, neighbours, family and acquaintances. In my opinion, ex-participants of this negotiation project don't use these skills in practice on their daily basis. It is definitely bad and I realise that for better or for worse they have to proove their possesion as successful speakers in the 21st century. Nearly 3 years ago there was an open lesson of our group when presenters of newspapers and media of Kyiv were welcomed and they filmed us having written informative articles about so called ,, new and higly improved generation'' that can resolve any conflict or dispute at school, among friends, relatives or family."

1,"To live is more important than to die. Even with less hope or fortune. For a living dog is better than a dead lion. My name is Jennifer Garcia, I am 69 years old. It all started toward the end of the year 2018 when I was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). I became a little child who does nothing but to depend on others for everything. I barely move my feet and hands myself. My son of blessed memory Anthony who passed on last year tried all he could to see me back on my feet but all his effort seemed impossible. The doctor said I will have to live like that for the few months I will spend on earth. The pastor gave me hope and prayers but it got to a time that I lost my faith as my health deteriorated. I began to await death by installment but on a fateful day when I went out for my normal therapy at the clinic, my very first boyfriend Stanley saw me in a wheelchair as my daughter pushed me in and he came with so much expression of disappointment on his face. He promised to go on a research on the internet to find if there is an alternative cure. He stopped at nothing until he discovered a post in google page by Darren Kent testifying how he got cured from ALS by Dr. Sani natural herbal remedies. We contacted him through his Email and WhatsApp. He told me that he has herbal healing remedies to cure not only ALS but also other incurable but management diseases. I believed or trusted him because I was left with no choice. I sent him money and He prepared his herbal mixture tonic, herbal cream and healing oil and sent them across to me.He gave me instructions which my daughter took seriously. After two weeks of treatment, I began to notice some great changes like I was able to talk clearly, eat, drink and move my hands and legs gradually. The third and fourth week I got cured. THE KEY POINT IS THAT I CAN DO THINGS NOW WITHOUT NEEDING SUPPORT OR BUGGING ANYBODY. Dr.Sani never asked me to advertise him but I think it’s what I should do to make our world a favorable and disease free one. Sharing is Caring. You can contact him today by E-mail: perfectherbalcure@gmail.com or call his tel; +2348118184266. I so much love this Dr. Sani Hassan for I owe my life to him. He is so kind and polite.Thanks for viewing."

People is used to fanaticize ""great speeches"" just for fun and they don't know to calm down their emotions and listen carefully with reflection. It's actually so easy to fool the population that looks sadistic."

Guy at    :"
1, -  had me cracking up!!!
1,"One day, my friend tapped on my shoulder and said with a smile. ""Your voice is truly herendous."" Unfortunately, I haven't recovered since then; resulting in destruction of my self esteem. And after two years of desperately trying to regain my talkative personality back, I have failed. *'Sigh'* Man, I hate him, if it would have been someone else then maybe I wouldn't be so devastated. I mean, your talking with someone and your supposed friend comes over telling you that you have a terrible voice. It just grides my gears."
1,"Politicians are being heard all the time and the media talks about what they say all the time, true or false.

1,"im coming from jun 23 , 2014 thank you ted"
1,"This speech helped me a lot, I have learned a lot from this. I feel frustrated that I can't communicate my point properly while speaking. Because I often feel anxious when speaking in front of many people. In this 10-minute long video, I get all the tips I need, even down to the smallest things I might never have thought of before, like that I can work with my voice tool box to speak better. There are also some comments that give implied messages from the video that make me think that i can be powerful with my voice tool box, if i speak with calmly and love. Hopefully I can apply it when I speak in front of many people in the next opportunity"

1. Gossip
2. Judging

7. Dogmatism

HAIL - To greet or acclaim enthusiastically
H - Honestly (Be straight and clear)
A - Authenticity (Be yourself)
I - Integrity (Be your word)
L - Love (wish them well)

Amazing Toolbox:
1. Register - Locate your voice at your chest to gain some weight
2. Timbre - Voices that are rich, smooth and warm
3. Prosody - Avoid monotone, a statement sounds like a question and repeat a statement
4. Pace - Get excited by saying something really quickly;  Slow down to emphasize; Silent
5. Pitch- Ex: ""Where did you leave my keys?"" with different pitches, are different meaning
6. Volume: Excited - High Volume; Attention - Low Volume

Warm up your voice
1. Arms up, deep breath in and sigh out
2, 3. Warm up the lips: Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba...; Brrrrr.......
4, 5. Tongue warm up: La, la, la, la, la....; Rrrrrr.....

1,"I don't do any of the sins.
I use HAIL
I think I use all the toolbox (not sure about timbre)

Yet I've never been heard in life. I'm 20 years old and my parents dont even know what food I like because they pay almost no attention to me. I used to just get shouted down whenever I spoke but even now they're stopped doing that they still don't listen no matter what I say.
My girlfriend doesn't listen to me.
I dont have any friends before but they didn't listen to me.

1,I have all of these things in me
1,Do you think you've just described the typical tory Govt Minister or MP?
1,"I have a voice problem.
When I talk to people, especially if it's a person I don't know and it's just to ask a small question, or me saying ""thank you"" or something. I always do it in a far higher pitched voice than is my neutral voice. Also faster.


It's an awkward anxiety thing. I need to be very conscious of that. My natural voice speed is very slow.
When he mentioned speaking from the chest, I think that will help me to remember. That's an easy one, rather than trying to just ""talk deeper"". Because that's hard in the moment and you don't get any practice.
Will help me slow down a bit too.


Got some value out of that. thumbs_up"

1,"Most people in the world are committing the seven sins of the speaking but the way he described how to give them up and move away from them was just amazing what I learned from this is just be yourself and have some honesty by being straight and clear and to say the right thing without hurting anybody by saying something hurtful and also have some authenticity which is to be yourself, you don't have to pretend in order to impress others and it's so associated with honesty the integrity and being your words, it's very important thing that we all need in our lives to do what you said so people can trust you and whenever you say something they'd believe you cuz they know that you're honest authentic and you have integrity and you love and care for them so when they feel  like they want someone to talk to you'd be thier first choice"

My problem here is, as long as I'm forced to live on this earth here, there are just lots and lots of facts that are very negative and sad. I mean, look at the world.
So, he wants me to basically irredicate any facts and just spread some funny and happy opinions, so that nobody can possibly get feel uncomfortable by what I'm saying.

My only gear is forward and I throw away the rear view mirror. 

The war is on and I need to uncover the enemy. 

I don't want to lose any Panzers before the battle. 

As to defense,  it's every man for himself. 

Improvise your defenses.

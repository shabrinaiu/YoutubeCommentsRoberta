1,You've lied to me again
1,I for some reason thought they come through the ears
1,"Thank you for my daily dose of despair, Kurzgesagt. Never thought I needed this in my late morning brunch."
1,the guy who keeps getting these viruses: aw sh here we go again
1,Welp. Time to nuke my pool
1," It's okay, Antibodies will get em, nothing beats them.
 OH SHI-"
0,"I like positiveness of Kurzgesagt videos. We are doomed, the universe will die, we will die, everyone will die, there are so many ways one can die, everything is in balance, but will die, you can choose to be happy but you will die"
2,"Kurzgesagt: you're more likely to drown in a pool than get infected.
Me: thank god"
1,"The video is great (as usual), though a bit scary; but the last part is genius, love it red_heart"
1,it would be funny if this lil fella was native to autralia. :D Just another thing that could kill you there
2,Hahaha that was so entertaining
1,"this actually happened near me in the US National Whitewater Center, they had to drain the entire man made rapids system due to it being infected with this amoeba after a girl died from it."
1,I find this unsettling.  Please don't do this again.

2,autism brain why is this my special interest
1,Why do I feel like this is already being looked at for some “gain of function” type research somewhere :(
1,This adds a new context to ‘losing brain cells’
1,It constantly saying to kill and to rape thats what the bug is saying. But then I pray and close my eyes and then use my self control and patience.

1,make a anime bro your animations are amazing
1,"People are talking about the animation improvements, and they are impressive, but I'm also loving the music. IT fits with both the topic and the Kurzgesagt style, its impressive. Let's have a thread about that!"
2,and the reward for the best action short movie goes to...
1,How is this so Epik???
2,why do they like ducks so much lol
0,A REVERSE HORROR GAME | CARRION
1,I am more worried about pathogenic bacteria
1,there is a wet duck fart in this video
1,I truely hope I'll forget what I just learned before this summer
1,"Basically, don't go outside"
1,"So as much as I understand, These Amoebae can only survive in hotwater.




So I can just shoot up a syringe full of Ice cold water into my nose when warm lake water enters inside.
Maybe?"
1,The mortality rate is from confirmed cases. Who knows what the real mortality rate is.
1,"Me: (clueless) ""Oh boy, my favorite existential dread channel. Today's a good day. Time to put it on!"""
1,I.           I.           I don’t know how to feel about this.          It’s terrifying
1,Guys I was searching for Entamoeba for my studies and YouTube recommended me thisface_with_tears_of_joy
1,"Hi, Kurzgesagt team
Can you all please make videos on space stuffs."
1,I can't help but admire how incredibly effective Fowleri is at bypassing all the human body's defenses. It is terrifying yet impressive.
0,"Cool.

This shit got me reading fucking science direct at 1.40am. And smiling/giggling while I do so."
1,"tbh i feel bad for anything but humans like its the only species that doesnt have to fight to survive like most of our deaths are caused by our own stupidity and because ""some people"" dont like what other people are doing with there lives like mind yo own business. and then theres viruses and stuff that has to go into someones body to live. if reincarnation exists the wirst of the worst are becoming viruses"

1,Another reason for not taking a bath
1,"I wonder, would this be the same brain-eating amoeba in that Disney water park that killed a kid and lead to its closing??"
1,I hope this doesn't find me cause it would starve
1,381 people have died of this since 1937 according to the video. I wonder how many people who know someone who's died of it are in this comment section right now.
1,Guess this amoeba gonna starve in my body
1,I would love to see a video about the giant redwoods and giant sequoia trees of California. Especially since they're critically endangered living fossils from the Mesozoic
1,"Astonishing animation! Also amoeba and the infestation by it is really captivating in a way like you cant help but look at a car accident, some sense of morbid curiosity is invoked. I remember finding an articla about it on Wiki, had a great read and also acquired a fear of warm stale bodies of water. Thx for the amazing content!"
1,So this is one of those super things they've made videos of in the past
2,Great.... well that made my day more uncomfortable...
1,And also they're scary
1,"The two-part episode ""Euphoria"" in Dr. House MD (if I remember correctly season 2) is about precisely Naegleria Fowleri and to me one of the best episodes of the entire series"
1,There is only a few cases not because it's rare to infected by it but because there is no a real accurate diagnosis for the people who infected by it.
2, the birb is so cute
1,@  me every time i watch this channel
1,this channel has taught me a lot
1,"On a second thought, I don't think watching this video was necessary..."
1,There actually is treatment against it… so you missed that in your researchskull
0,Dredd is black and that's RACIST!!!!
1,I think that happened to me my brain felt like its exploding and after i vomited i was much better
1,"Bro just cover your nose when jumping in the water, and when you have your head underwater. Or use a Swim mask that covers eyes and nose. Already made preventing things for this."
1,"I really like the changes you're making to the format, the sound design here is just amazing ! This said the music/SFX can be a tad distracting by moment."
0,horror
1,"Look another threat, ""if you dont watch this we will threaten it onto you"""
1,Covid isn't gone my aunt is dead now we pulled her off life support over the weekend.
2,I love the bird that is the narrator at the end
1,Why is nobody talking about how goofy that ending part is
1,"Gosh, Now I have added a new reason not to swim in waters a lot sneezing_face. Be careful guys, always cover your nose when diving"
1,your animation have improved so much!
1,I work at a warehouse in the high desert (arid and a lot of dust) and everyday my nose is just stuffed with mucous and dust it's insane! I usually wash my nostrils in the bathrooms tap water by inhaling (obviously not strong enough to reach my lungs) to loosen the membrane and I can blow away the nastiness... now I will stop that indefinitely and look for a new method.
1,My boyfriend may have that.
1,"Great. I now understand that play in a river, which is one of my favorite summer activity, can be lethal."
1,"Our poor president must have a whole colony of these in his head, it all makes sense now!"
1,"Something is different, I can feel it"
1,"I knew I've seen this one somewhere else! House MD episodes Euphoria parts 1 and 2. After watching Kurzgesagt episode I could spot some inconsistencies in those episodes (which is of course logical since its TV) but at the episodes the patients started by having a symptom of laughing to everything, can this happen for real with naegleria?"
2,thanks for giving me an irrational fear for all of summer time! Love ya Kurzgasagt ;)
2,I love the animations!! <3
1,Absolutly horrible narration with that wierd ass narrater please have the usuall human voice where you can acctually hear and make out a diffrence in the words being said
2,I love the massive upgrade in quality
1,"LOVEDDD THISsmiling_face_with_heart-eyes I have my Microbiology finals tmrw, just loved how well it's explained in this"

1,I just dived like 10x in a warm swimming pool last month skull
1, Is this the first bird uwu in kurzgesagt's videos?

1,How many times water has gone up my nose so happy I haven’t gotten this
1,First time seeing a human in their videos
1,"dragons?
edit: wait nvm its about cells"
1,Why does a kurzgasagt video need to be so perfect always!
2,"Glad, I don't involve much in pool or river. But this is the best scary one."
1,Kurzgesagt as always here to make us fear everything.
1,Well my pool is cold as HELL and the fella lives in hot water right? Well my pool is ICE cold and when i say ice cold i mean ANTARCTICA level cold
1,The pig meat also has a brain parasite that destroys the human brain

1,What about lotus eater?
0,can this kill you?
2,Sometimes ignorance is bliss.
1,"The jump in the quality of production is astonishing, amazing <3"
1,*of course* Kurzgesagt go with the brain eating amoeba with a 97% fatality rate as an opportunity to introduce existential dread to promote pretty things - classic! :) <3 <3 <3
1,"Well, at least now I know what I'm going to be having nightmares about tonight..."
2,Are we sure we are not in the game Plague Inc. this seems like it was specially made to kill humans
1,the guy in the video is kinda….
1,I think that the video focused way too long on the scary aspects and not enough on the 'let's put this risk into perspective' part.
1,"Reminds me of the show braindead, now all they need to do is use ants as carriers and infect politicians."
1,"the animation is on another level in this one, the depth is impressive"
1,12 people
1,"This is why I don't like it when my friends often jump into the pool without seeing me very close to them, they splash water too. It's basically very dangerous and they are very authoritative. I was wary and didn't want to approach them because it was said that they weren't careful at all and sometimes they didn't realize they were doing it because they were carried away by their excitement. Germs are all around and it's not easy to see. Seen from the naked eye is not enough, so I advise people around me to avoid bacteria and stay clean. Terrible, it's truly scary and sad to be exposed to various kinds of small creatures like these. A disease that is difficult to deal with then to death is terrifying. I love all your videos that you have posted and and it's always fun for me to watch. Thank you."
1,"so you have lots of checklist before you're one of those unlucky victims of the amoeba
1. is it hot? summer perhaps?
2. did you swim in freshwater body of water? perhaps a mismanaged swimming pool?
3. do you dive on that said body of water?
4. any water got inside your nose?
on the amoeba scale
5. did you able to reach high enough inside the nose?
6. able to find anything interesting inside the nose?
7. did you encounter those defenses? are you still alive?
8. still did you find what you're looking for?
back to the scale of human
9. are you go to hospital?
10. have they found that it's actually brain eating amoeba? (well it's 97% for a reason and not 100%)

also are salt their big weakness? (as oceans or sea or bodies of water with higher saline content aren't habitats of this amoeba)"
1,"some unlucky people have to ""deal with it"" lol"
1,Si The Narrator was a blue bird all along huh?
1,We finally see what the kurzgesagt narator looks like
1,"the longer i watch the video, the more horrified i get, and now am afraid to go the swimming pool this summer..."
1,Eye used too have 1of ‘em died by no eating
1,The music for this video is just OK_hand
1,"I've always thought this, but his voice is so cuuute"
0,I would just kill myself :D
1,"Well.. if this brain-eating amoeba somehow got into my brain.. then I’m pretty sure that I’ll die, after all, how many of these naeglerias would take to destroy one brain cell?"
1,The ending yes
1,I'm wondeing how long they spent on that moth animation 
1,Kurzgesagt Has seriously upped its animation and background score with this one.
1,Holy moly I will never dive again lmfao
1,"Sharks have good nose and always in water , why they don't get affected"
1,There is no cure???
2,love the new animations
1,Thanks I’m never going swimming again
1,The duck having pupils is somehow every curse to me.

1,"Humans: Lets enjoy nature and go outside 
Nature: Ok, hey brain eating thingy, you hungry?"
1,There were a lot of anime references in this video.
1,it looks like a spore creature
1,"The most valuable thing I've learnt today is the comparison of hair with amoeba hence the brain cells.
Now I can relate the brain cells with hair thickness as a measurement. Thank you.grinning_face"
1,I fudging love this channel. They’ve become so good at animating in their own style it’s so beyond me how they do it and keep improving
0,"My brother had a brain eating amoeba once, poor thing died."
1, millons BUT I NEED BILLONS
1,if i get this shit im calling the ambulance and asking to be euthenized. nobody should be dealing with that shit im gonna die anyway
1,Can the amoeba also enter/spread in the ear Canals?
1,"Ah yes the star of the only episode of ""monsters inside of me"" that I remembered, Thanks Kurzgesagt!"

2,"You had a lot of fun with the animation in this one, I love it!"
1,Dread needs to narrate whole videos. Just saying.
1,this channel makes everyone feel like a meteorite blasting away all of humanity not feel like such a bad thing

2,Those 3d were nice

1,"First, please give a little two_heartsred_heart"
1,Oh holy moly this is so horrifying I'm so glad it's that rare. Btw your ad in the end was next level creativity :)
1,"Ngl I always enjoyed the signature Kurzgesagt existential dread but this is... Different. This only arouses disgust and horror. I want to feel cosmically insignificant, not as a food for a parasitic amoeba."
2, welcome to timed comments my friend
1,i love how kurzgesagt gives me an existencial crisis every video
1,"Largest epidemic of Naegleria fowleri happened in the 60s. 16 young people died after visiting a pool in Ústí nad Labem, Czech republic. Doctors were very confused, it was an unkown disease back than."
1,"Its kind of comforting to think about how hard the immune system fights for you, despite the fact its only for self preservation of course"
1,is it just me or are the anamaions inroving
2,The animation is gettig better and better each video i love it
1,Can we talk about how amazing that merch ad is?? You bet I already have 3 posters in the shopping cart lol

1,"I don’t know if you guys got a new arti director or what, but the animations/drawings this episode ROCKED! The blonde human looked so detailed without being extreme!"
1,"Fun fact:All tiktokers have this amoeba inside of their brains.

1,"Another amazing Kurzgesagt video, but can we talk about how good the background music is for this episode??? smiling_face_with_heart-eyes"
2,great now ill never go outside
0,Music is shit
1,"Anyone else here after getting some water up their nose at the lake? grinning_face_with_sweat

 might help bring you some comfort"
1,The name for this page is so difficult to spell. It's hard to find YouTube.
1,"Those 3% who survived amoeba: ""Amateurs!"""
2,Such a fan of the immune system.
2,LMAO that thumbnail. It's Lahmu!
1,Bacteriophages / phage therapy to target this parasite?
1,"If I want existential dread, I need look no father than the loved ones around me with chronic health issues that are slowly dragging them into agonizing death. Inevitably I will join them, and begin the long, soul eroding march of decay and suffering, ending with a miserable and utterly unremarkable fatality. Being unimportant and doomed gives all the fuel one needs to drown in the darkness of the mind.
Except I'm not predisposed to think that way.
Cheers!"
1,Your rare dose of internet
1,There was an outbreak in Czech republic because of a pool in Ústí nad Labem in the sixties. During those three years 16 people died because of this amoeba. I only remember it because i study biology at uni and we talked about this and ot seemed so surreal
1,IS THAT A SUPER-DETAILED REALISTIC LOOKING HUMAN IN A KURZKESAGT VIDEO?!
1,"you guys riped my hipocondria with the ""just a few hundred cases,so you probably wont die""."
1,This is why I wait a month for my fix. The animation quality is always improving impressively
1,"Now I'm afraid of taking a bath, thanks"
1,Whoa that end ad for the posters was really awesome! The animation is legendary :Dj
1,And you ARE A BIRD WHATATATATATATTATATATATATATAATAT
1,"Oh boy, a new Kurzegesagt video. No existential dread, I hope. smiling_face_with_tear"
1,"I think of this everytime I see a kayaker who doesn't use a nose clip for when they roll the kayak.  I've seen guys that roll upside down and just let their sinuses fill with water, and then blow it all out when they roll back upright.  It gives me the shudders.  I couldn't possibly kayak without using those nose clips.  Even without nasty bugs in the water it just hurts having your sinuses filled up with water!"
1,I've been having a mild fever the last 2 days and YouTube thought it's a good time to scare me lol
1,"Buy a pair of nose plugs, got it."
1,I was terrified until the end :/
1,"is it um, common?"
1,Kurzgesagt improves their quality more faster than I have brain cells.
1,My existential dread it's always there after a video of Kurzgesagt.
1,well time to throw out all my swimming equiqment
1,This exoloded my brain face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy
1,i don't know why but the sound that came from the duck sitting on the pipe at the end of the video made me laugh too much!
1,You damn B***h I wasn't going to go swimming again in my entire life before you said there had been only 381 cases omfg
1,Guys what if u take a bath u will touch water
1,“I can’t exists in the presence of awh” face_with_tears_of_joy
1,"""it thrives in warm weather"".    Hear me out.

Repetitive brain freeze"
1,Bill Gates thought: How can I get this into one of the vaccine boosters?
1,"Well done, Kurzgesagt! Your animations get more beautiful with each video!"
1,"I think I'd be interesting if you could make a video on ""fixing the human body"". Essentially, perfecting how to human body works with all it's flaws. Maybe a plan for a future video?"
1,This explains the USA
2,I love this channel and all its products!
1,"Thanks, now I will never go swimmig again!
At least I didn't like it anyway."
1,only thing i did for kurzgesagt was buy the immune book lol

0,I am now werry scared
1,ı think this channel that produces the best quality content on youtube
1,"It seems to me as if someone had been watching a bit too much of anime, based on the animation style, more specifically the expressions the bird had at the end.
Looks like a mix of anime and then cartoon. Very intriguing."
1,"i love how they changed the title from the most ""overhyped"" parasite on earth to something more serious lmao"
2,Love the new existential dread character... hope they don't come back ;)

1,Can't eat what I don't have
1,"Pick your infection: rabies, amoebas, or prions.

GO!"
1, realistic human in Kurzgesagt video is a seriously cursed image...
1,Another reason to be anctious
1,"Oh boy, that micro organism sounds pretty nasty. Thankfully hes gonna talk about how we're gonna treat it with modern medicine as long as we catch it in time. 

Oh."
1,"Another failure of our Immune system, pathetic really."
1,POV: watching this with one of the symptoms
1,I love how the video spends like 5 minutes explaining how this is a horrible creature that will most certainly kill you and the last minute telling you that it's actually not THAT big of a deal.
1,"The face and the butterflies holy crap
The animation just keeps on getting better!!!"
1,"Know what, I think I’ll not go swimming, ever."
1,"Ah, so this is what 90% of the population has. No wonder..."
1,*Is this why my mom doesnt like me going on the pool*

1,Nah bro I can’t even swim I would probably just die of drowninggrinning_face_with_sweat
0,Scared face_screaming_in_fear

2,Nice now I love my existence even more
1,"My brains already dead, these little guys would starve"
2,"The animations are looking soooo clean, GREAT JOB!"
1,But y’all said we immune to all diseases
1,Yeah watching this video almost gave me a massive anxiety attack. One that I haven’t felt since the last time I survived a near death experience. I really wish I hadn’t ever learned about this thing. Now I will no longer desire to swim in oceans or pools anymore. No thank you. Especially with my autoimmune disorder? This thing would see me as a buffet.
1,is this the first time Kurzgesagt has shown animated humans?
1,in space with markeplier
1,So i guess getting water in your nose _wont_ kill you
1,"Hence the joke about leave proper pH of pools. The chlorine is fine, when little kids go blind."
1,"Your video quality is growing exponentially, just see that you do not loose your videos’(animations’) simplicity."
1,kurzgesagt has truly mastered the marketing pitch! face_with_tears_of_joy

1,Thanks! Now I am even more terrified in swimming on water!
1,I can’t wait to sit in my bed at night thinking about all the little monsters eating my brain
1,This was posted five months before the Nevada amoeba incident-
1,"Love the new animations and style, so happy to see you grow!"
1,"I've always appreciated the progress in the quality of the animation that this channel has shown, and this video just amazes me in how good it looks. A bow to the team."

1,kurzgesagt has single handedly convinced me to never go into water that hasn't been well treated by chemicals and never ever drink tap water
1,"oh my god, I hope this channel wont go woke (as my pattern recognition has seen people slowly getting woke with the indication of their artstyles changing similar to your typical woke person)"
1,"finally you people uploaded

1,Recently I started reading immune and it is great also these things remind be my of carrion the game
1,"Ah! yes....
The existential crisis every time I watch these videos."
1,ok but the music in this video goes hard
1," The USAF did this in Vietnam, and it were pretty effective."
1,"Omg, the narrator bird is so cute. rolling_on_the_floor_laughing"
1,So what I learned is.. always swim in a ice bath.
1,I wonder if the rise in global temperatures will also increase the occurrences of this ameba? Terrifying.
1,Im  never swimming again
1,"Love the show, love the knolege you put out, but I don't like these typ of video's. It feels like you just want to scare us for no reason. cause this is what I see: ""Look a very dangerous desiseas that will most likely kill you!! except it doesn'tthumbs_up."" We can't fantisise about the future, we cant do anything about it ourselves, at this point we just know and get scared that maybe we could be one of the 381 deaths who died from this desiseas."
1,"I don't get it. Thousands of people jump into rivers, lakes every day. What is THE main barrier that prevents all of them from not being dead? Having a couple drops of water up in your nose is pretty common."
1,And this is what has been ravishing the GOP! And you find this in baptism water as well...but it explains a lot!
1,But the first 10 second sof the videos are so awesome tho smiling_face_with_heart-eyes
1,When i swim when my when the amoeba enters to my nose nothing strange happened do we have brain either resistant armor bra they didn't kill my brain because i'm still alive
1,"that end promotion though, best plug i've seen in a while
also does that mean the blue duck with the wacky hairdo is kurzgesagt's official sona? (i don't know the term for avian fursonas so i just used 'sona' lol)"

1,"I flush my nose twice a day with tap water. And dwell on this ameba everytime I do it. So far, so good. Untill one day it won't be good face_with_tears_of_joy"
1,The intro never gets old
1,Summer 2022 canceled disappointed_face
1,"While I'm terrified of the concept, I know it's not a big threat."
1,Could destroying that section of the brain be an effective treatment? In essence scorched Earth tactics that would both destroy the amoebas and leave a place for pressure to go?
1,The animation in this video is amazing! You guys really outdid yourselves with this one
1,"Hmmm... I wonder about 3% of infected who survived. Are thier immune systems going to be able to defend itself again like it usually works against bacterias or viruses? Or is it just a miracle with modern medical intervention that saved them (meaning thier immune systems didn't develop immunity to it. Is that how it works? Like if your immune system and the invader is in a fist fight, medical intervention is like a sniper that just kills the invader and the immune system learnt nothing or too little of how to fight against it)

What are the new immune weapons? How do the complementary system adapt?"
1,glad I subscribed to the newsletter. Otherwise I'd never know about this video. THANKS!
1,"So, Kurzgesagt is revisiting its “Damn, Nature. You scary!” vein of videos.

Good."

1,"YOOO I'm here early!!!
Great video as always BTW, Kurzgesagt! :D"
1,"@kurzgesagt

I’m a huge fan of your videos, but this one is a real puzzler for me. You have an extremely powerful platform to inform, inspire and educate, and you decided to make a video about a disease that effects 2 people globally per year in a way that will likely just cause more people to unnecessarily avoid recreation and outdoor activities.

Like, the really whimsical videos about physics (put all the nuclear bombs together) aren’t exactly positive, but they have a message that’s helpful “nukes are bad.” What message are you trying to send here?

Not saying that it’s a bad video, but did you just make this for fear-mongering clickbait? Very disappointed."
1,Is there any in finland?
1,Can't wait to be 18 and get my first poster
1,how does one know how successful it is at infecting if it flies so under the radar that people don't report it. Even the first line of defense which is the most successful is still not within the dramatic symptom range to need medical attention so how do we know 90+% die from it?
1,"Is it just me, or did the visual style get an overhaul? There is a ton of more detail in the video!"
1,What a perfect thing to upload on the day I’ve been hospitalized twice
2,I love this kind of video. Like war but immune system ver. Pls more like this video all kind of virus enter in your body.

1,Another epic upload
2,"thanks, now I can sleep calmly."
2,"Thanks for making a video about amoeba, they've always been interesting! <3 Would love more videos on them or parasites in general."
1,"Just want to say this is an extremely (as normal) arcuate video. This species of amoeba is what I've specialised this in with my work. I just want to highlight infection rates are so low we simply don't have enough of a sample size to give a solid time frame from symptoms to death. But just to highlight a few things;

A week from infection to death is pretty must spot on, although before you have time to register the more severe symptoms, you're more likely to be in a coma happening around the 48 hour mark. 

The main point which is just not accurate is treatment. Amphotericin B is antifungal which is capable of killing N. fowleri inside of a person. It can also be used in combination therapy with Rifampin. There are a few others listed on the CDC but I don't recall any of the named one (bar the ones I posted) when writing up my work / grant applications from the published literature. There is an argument to be made this isn't counted as a treatment as the target of the compounds are for something else. We're just fortunate they work on other things like N. fowleri. 

The problem with N. fowleri is not the drugs its actually diagnosis. In most cases, if not very nearly all of them it is misdiagnosed as something else (due to how common the symptoms are) which leads to treatment which is ineffective. By the time a PCR is done to identify the infection, thats when the irreversible damage has been done. Just for point of reference, up to 24 hours without symptoms, symptoms kick in, standard treatment for something follows, then a PCR which can take 12-24 hour time frame. 

Furthermore, as to initial infection. The most common way (at least in the states) of being infected isn't any of the reasons listed in the video (IIRC water sports and poorly chlorinated pools come in at 2+3), its actually nasal spray. The data shows in the states a lot of the patients had refilled their nasal sprays from tap water instead of the correct medium to cut costs. This gives the most direct, easiest route for the amoeba to take. 

For anyone that's still interested, the condition is called Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis. If anyone is super interested I suggest reading up on Naegleria Genus overall, not just N. fowleri. The amount of transformations some of them can do is fascinating."
2,I too recently swam in a very hot pond which was very dirty with huge amounts of algae  which is like the perfect place for that amoeba wish me luck guys if i don't reply after 10 days give homeless people some money to pay respect to me thanks guys hope to see u in 10 days
0,i think there is a war in our brains
1,Whenever I see humans animated in kurzgesagt I feel like something is wrong
1,"What the! Sure. Amazing episode, as always"
0,"i had amoeba once, poor little parasite, it died of hungry"
2,I love how the inmune system just tries to calm it down but makes it even worse.
1,Why did I watch this? I know i'll think about this the next time I am swimming.
1,I'm never going to swim again
1,"Remember kids, eat and stay healthy"
1,"i made a presentation on this a few weeks ago as a college project. this exact amoeba. anyway, fascinating video as always! :D"

1,"Bro this amoeba really just be like 
""Oh teehee I'm just a funny little slime boy eating bacteria in this pond, but don't let me get too far into your nose because *I will slip past your body's defenses with ease and rip your brain apart, piece by piece* , tee hee!"""
1,Me when kurzgesagt uploads:information jntensifies.
1,So ur telling me that the owner of this channel is a bird?
1,I remember one time the water in some close city's in Texas they shut off the water because it was contaminated with those amibas
1,this is why I dont swim in Rivers At Philippines
1,WELL FUCK THAT. IM NEVER TOICHIN WATER AGAIN
1,"""Dont eat my brain"" works perfectly here !"

1,"Ah yes, Kurzgesagt back again to put the fear of god back into us"
1,This is scarily similar to what COVID probably does to people...why so many of us have warping/loss of smell and mental fogginess for a long time (forever?) afterwards.  Brain/nerve damage.  Great.
2,Really love this channel it's amazing
1,The epic battles of our immune system against foreign invaders has never been so well animated.

1,"Finally it has been sooo long since the last video of this channel came out, very excited to watch star-struck"
2,"WOW! The animation is pretty impressive in this video, I love watching the art become more advanced. The skit was fun too."
1,"This new animation style is quite bad to look at. It causes strong uncanny feeling (as in uncanny valley).

If this becomes the norm I will unfortunatelly have to stop watching - or just listen in background, the information content is still good, but I will miss the good animation.

For better feedback, in case you read the comment:
,  - bad uncanny feeling
 - ok-ish, still looks weird, at least in between the normal style
,  - *really* bad uncanny feeling
 - looks fine
 - looks weird but not uncanny"

1,"What if we clean our nose when naegleria fowleri is at the end of our nose, will we get rid of it or will it be okay because it clings so firmly? Is there a possibility of contamination from bottled water that is not treated very well?"
1,Moral of story: just swim in the pool. There's nothing in your hands anyway. Maybe try not to get water in your nose
1,I hope i don't get that creature
1,....What a thrill.....         BRaaiiin Eaaaateeeer...

2,"i loved this video, its so creepy and the ending with dread was amazing holy hell!! i love you kurgz i really do!"
1,"Whoa, team, inferring that your products will help rid someone of a complicated psychological condition because it can't exist in the face of ""awe"" feels uncomfortably predatory. Are you planning to sell chocolate next a remind people that ""chemically eating the chocolate will help you feel less of that depression."" Please don't equate filling your life with purchases as a way to escape dread. Please."
2,Loving the new artstyle! c:
1,I cant wait to scare the living shit out of some people

1,I love how you animated the human face and the flying moths looked really cool! Terrifying subject tho!
1,Do we have to use wolves as the example. Seriously? There is enough misconceptions about them that is causing them to be hunted to the brink of extinction.
1,So one time me and my cousin and my friends went swimming in lake so there was a slide my friend said come for youre first time but he forgot to say plug youre nose then it went in my mouth and nose but 2yrs/1yr I think I’m not sick

1,"May I ask? Does the parasite also live in seas, oceans or at beaches?"
1,"I remember one summer. The news in the USA was going off about them and so many people dying from it that summer.

Made me scared to go swim in lakes"
2,I love the casual terraria boss music that lingers through out.
2,"why is the existential treat black? (joking, calm your tits)"
1,Don't drink water through your nose. Got it.

1,"This is why I’m a firm believer of medical nanotechnology. Humans NEED to have Nanobots in the immune system to help with physical invaders like these. 

Grab them physically and rip them apart with sonar pulses and nano spikes."

2,Thanks for the nightmare fuel.
1,"I heard about this thing a long time ago and it’s always made me paranoid. I went to a lake this past weekend and rode a jet ski but I was terrified of falling into the water cuz of how it enters your nose. I’ve never really swam before in my life, and I sure as hell don’t ever plan to lmao"

0,I am deeply disturbed by exploits within my immune system.
1,I am genuinely afraid of this. 97% death rate and you don't know about it till it's too late? Love the content and the delivery but damn. You just can't help but feel helpless

1,"Normal levels of chlorination will easily deal with Naegleria fowleri in clean pipes, however biofilm on the inside of them can increase its survival time. For this reason, never use straight tap water for nasal irrigation (and just, you know, don't do that in the first place without a medical recommendation). As for swimming, if you always keep water from going up your nose, you're fine, so get some noseplugs if this really freaks you out. There are things in this universe which can kill you in horrifying ways that we have no means to address; this isn't one of them."
1,Let me question something do you know where you will go after you die? If not let me say you can have a choice to either go to hell or heaven see 2000 years ago there was this man named Jesus who died on the cross for our sins and rose alive 3 days later all because he truly loved us he died for us so I question you now do you truly believe in Jesus or do you live for the world turn to Jesus Christ trust in him Christ has way much more to give than the world he loves us turn to Christ
1,"Correct me if I'm wrong but this is the reason why Disney's River Country closed, right?"
1,"Ngl, that amoeba looks so chill to just be with."
1,True fans watch the German version first only to watch the English version after
1,First time im early :D

Everyday that one of your videos come out is a good day for me and I want to thank you!"
1,Ost goes hard on this one

1,"Kurzgesagt, your videos are fine arts on top of fun to watch and very educating. I humbly request for more biological system videos, the one immune system video got my grades up. Your work is truly remarkable and worthy."
1,"At least the people who read this comment will be okay

The amoeba only eats braincells"
1,"Welp... that does it; I'm never going to touch water again.

You should probably make a video on not touching water so that I can drink and not die, thankyouverymuchhaveanicedaybai"
1,"these amoebas are too overpowered, i hope they get a nerf in the next balance patch"
1,I was waiting for him to get to the amount of people who have had the disease.
2,Great video! Thank you for another phobia xD
2,"Lmao the animation at the end was pretty cute, ngl"
1,"the ending of this video was not only unexpected but amazing, this is true marketing for gen z, keep it up <3"
1,I don't know how you do it but you cover every subject I have just finished on my medicine course xD
1,The first time I heard about brain eating amoeba was in the movie Hackers
1,"Thanks Kurzgesagt, now I can use my old inflatable pool at home."
1,"No more water, Forever."
1,*me watching this after i just swam from a public pool: nervous sweating*
1,me convincing myself that I’m just superior and that my immune system could easily destroy the amoeba:  slightly_smiling_face
1,"""overhyped""
""but yeah you're 97% likely to die if you get infected""
Uhh ok..."
1,"You can survive brain eating amoeba, Here's how first off like he mentioned the neutrophils rip them apart and vomit chemicals, Your unlucky if its reaches the brain but if it does the Eosinphlis and Microglia & should take care of it so thats the 3% chance of surving, So I wish people luck whoever get this parasite is to Survive"
1,Didn’t we have similar thoughts about a few other diseases?????? That we didn’t think would spread that much and now uhhhh yeah
1,This is why I stick to my own pool
1,You can make a movie out of this!
1,I have a question is there a way to stop the thing
1,Me being a muslim and having eviloutonary poster does not help me about my existentional dread
2,The animation and music is fantastic! Thank you for your great work!
1,this was the coolest animation i have ever seen
2,This is such a cool way of explaining a deadly disease. Great Job!
0,I was looking up a forgotten weapons video and it gave me this..
1, this is why is use nose plugs
1,I used to like you Amoeba! You little monster.
2,omg the new animations are so good. good job
1,Let's just take  as face reveal
1,So basically this amoeba is ruzzia
1,"Two things about this video
1. I just read an article on this the other day
2. Oh hello existential dread. How you doing today"
1,Most over hyped monster? Shouldn't you have saved that title for a video on covid?
1,I take bath in warm water every day cold_face
1,ooh another immune system episode
1,My mother was a lifeguard at a summer camp in Florida when she was in high school. They had a kid die from this while she was there. She became a nurse and always tried to help people but she still cries when she talks about this.
2,Love the colours that are used in your animations! You should do wall-papers!!
2,Once again I traumatized myself great
1,I just learned this Brain Eating Amoeba from watching Brave Wilderness last month. Thank you for explaining it thoroughly!!
1,"""I'm here to make you question your own existence and everything you hold dear in life!"" ""Um, could you not, please?"" is my new favorite quotation. Thank you."
1,We do a little trolling
1,hey i noticed the monkey or ape from the intro  holds something diffrent every vid
2,Well that was absolutely horrifying.
1,Achievement:dying in 24 hour's starting now
2,I LOVE the music its so cheery and fun XD
1,Isn't this the first time Kurzgesagt has animated a human this properly? 
1,its just gonna leave my body as soon as it enters because i have no brain cells for it to consume
2,This might be why I’m growing dumber lol
1,Basically twitter
1,"Hold up, was that an official, cannon, Philipp duck?"
1,Chubbyemu collab when?
1,Bruh the end
1,You can make a movie with this animation style. Amazing work guys!
1,The most horrible parasites are humans.
0,Why is this scarier than a horror movie? Because this can happen
1,"Wow, I quickly went from being horrified *(****),* To not being horrified anymore *(****),* To watching the most well-made merchandise commercial out there *(****).* What a 10 minute Ride it's been! 
Talk about a Rollercoaster!"
1,"Finally, kurzgesagt, finally, we have been waiting for you to release another video"
1,"Watched this in German, now English. Danke Kurzgesagt!"
2,"The animation in this video was the best i have ever seen on this channel, keep up the good job!"
1,Why do I feel like this is less science communication & more  scare-tactical secretions  contrived to generate views from a channel with 18 million subscribers??
1,Really….. watched this whole video thinking I’m never doing water sports again! Then at the end you said you are more likely to die from downing
1,"kuzgesagt: what if this monster enters our body?
me: short answer you die"
1,anyone else want a video about weather on other planets?
1,"Man the 3D stuff they’re experimenting with fits right in with the kurzgesagt style. There’s obviously the person’s head, but I want to point out that those moths are gorgeous - totally unnecessary effort for that visualization. Quality of these is crazy."
1,"That's why I never swin on freshwater lakes, rivers and other bodies of waters haha I'm afraid to this since I was a child, now I'm adult and still never swin to any freshwater bodies of water."
1,"The sheer quality, mann"
1,"Oooh I wanted so much to buy your products, but I can't pay their way to Brazil loudly_crying_face"
1,I'm not swimming ever again
1,Thank you again for making me terrified of life.
2,The art style for the person in the beginning is so cool!! Its like 2D and 3D at the same time
1,"Existential dread needs a recurring character, like space birb at the end of the video"
1,"Something to comprehend is just how much damage can be done even if one DOES survive. You might not even know you survived it, because the 'damage' would feel temporary... but it might affect the rest of your life. For example, you'd have become 'fatigued' and sick... recovered... but now, you're something like 15% slower overall (brain function, reaction time, everything).

Reminds me of 'long COVID'. face_vomiting

1,"Kurgezat: pls buy our merch

Me: fucking take my money"
2,Yo! Your animation is getting better
1,"I just hold my breath when I enter water via a slide or jumping. It’s a sure way to prevent water from getting up your nose. Even without brain eating amoeba, untreated water up your nose is still going to give you an ENT infection of some kind that’s unlikely to go away on its own, and getting it out is a chore."
1,"Kurzgesasgt's best videos are consistently the ones about biology. If these videos aren't used in educational curriculum for the next generations of children in U.S. schools, I will be beyond confused. If it can interest an ADHD-ridden autism-diagnosed 26 year old manchild like me, I guarantee children will become absolutely enamored with stuff like this. Visual, audial, and textual learning. It's all three modal operations of learning beautifully and thoughtfully put together. 

I love this channel. I show my 6th grade cousin them all the time when she needs help with a subject in school, sciences especially. Kurz is genuinely a blessing for education."
1,"thanks, now I'm afraid to go into water"
1,"Hello, germophobe. It's nice to see you again."
1,This channel's animations are heading closer to hyperrealism every day.
1,I liked the new animations keep it up!
1,"This video is taking a very dark turn! I love it, but I must resist and watch it tomorrow or I will have nightmares! grinning_face_with_sweat"
1,this makes me scard plz say this is not real
1,but what if i don't have a brain
1,alright im never going into water again
1,The nanomachines I've implanted into my body absolutely shredding the amoebas are gonna have fun
1,"Thankfully and hopefully I never will or have gotten this, it probably would’ve made my Epilepsy a hella lot worse and maybe I would’ve had them more often with this parasite.

Though on the bright side I haven’t had one for quite a while, I usually only have 1 or 2 a year if I’m unlucky."
1,"And people tell me I should go outside once in a while during the summer season, good thing that I hate summer and never leave my apartment except when Im going to work."
1,"one more way to die expressionless_faceexpressionless_faceexpressionless_face
very awesome"
1,It's the first time i watch kurzgesagt this early
1, a way to treat it woild be gene editimg so our immune systems could fight this amoebae and other pathogens that are like aliens to it
1,"Me sweting so hard cuz my brain was painingskull 
But luckily it was a head ache"
1,For the algorithm. raised_fist
1,I’m guessing that burb is the narrator’s avatar.
1,"And here I am seeing the notification and thinking ""ah yes, it must be the Loch Ness monster or Godzilla"". Time to never go swimming again :D"
1,"As someone who has migraines...this is terrifying. It literally sounds like a migraine...I have dreamt of sawing my brain open.
This is why I refuse to go into lakes or ponds or swimpools...ocean only."
1,"Been waiting so long for another video, finally, keep up the good work, amazing vid as always"
1,"Yesterday they told in the news in my country that somone died from this ameba ,and they also said that this is an extremly rare case and that only 400 died from these ameba in recorded history"
1,"True story, i saw this parasite wipe out an entire invading alien civilization of tripods"
1,"Technically insects are not attracted to lights. They end up flying around lights because they mistake artificial lights for the moon.
    Insects evolved in a world with very near by lights. Usually there is just the moon. The moon is so far away that it's not really effected by parallax much so long as you only move around on Earth.
    This is handy as, keeping the moon in the same place in the sky no matter how far you move, so it can be used to navigate or follow a straight line. Just keep the moon in the same place relative you you.
    However if you try this with a nearby light source you will follow a spiral and eventually you bump into it."
0,This should actually be a real Eldritch Horror
1,I remember reading a story of an dude who caught this by drinking water during a shower and it has stuck with me since
1,At Least There Not in our bath rub
1,Please let Existential Dread be a recurring character.
1,"Welp, guess I'm never going to a beach again upside-down_face"
1,"I was hoping the video would end with a ""oh you can only get it from this one specific animal/jungle/reef"". My existential dread has grown."
1,"*Kurzgesagt:* Okay, so this video is going to be about a horrifying, brain-eating amoeba.
*Epic Mountain:* …Funny trumpets."
1,Can you make existential dread a regular character on the show? haha
0,Ya’ll doing horror videos now huh
1,The fact that this is known is Absolutely Terrifying...
2,I wish I had a brain to be eaten…
1,"Bro, what happened your animating crew is getting better and better by the second."
1,Can you please make a video about the brain?!?!?!?!?!
1,"Now imagine this, but scaled up enough so you can see it, and it just burrows into the side of your head.



you're welcome for the nightmares"
1,thanks for reminding that I could die for going out for a swim in a way that's not drowing
1,And this is why I don't swim in fresh water. The Ocean or a heavily treated pool is where I swim.
0,"Dread: impossible
Narrator: *You fool*"
2,"I wish he was my Science or Chemistry Teacher, Lol."
1,"Is Kurzgesagt a cooperative where workers take their own decisions about the working conditions, subjects to work on, salaries, etc?"
1,The quality of these videos is just amazing everytime!
1,So… should we boil our pools so it can’t multiply?
1,There does exist a desperate cure: Amphotericin B.  Problem?  You need a lot of it - so much so that you fck up your kidneys if you survive.
1,conclusion: when u get infected by these. ur basically already dead
2,Be careful with neti pots people
1,If they like heat drink a milkshake it’s cold and will probably make you have a brain freeze
1,"Ah...something new to worry about now that Covid-19 and WW3 with Russia is starting to wane in interest to the American public.  But, I'm sure if this brain eating amoeba becomes a serious problem for the masses, then Big Pharma will suddenly announce their latest amoebacidal drug to take care of it that the FDA will ""fast track"" approve for general use.  We'll only need ten treatments of it at $10,000 per treatment!"
1,I think these videos should come with a trigger warning for people with health anxiety aahah
1,"How did your animations get better, I didn’t think it could be done"
1,"If you're doing interesting diseases, please do Rabies. Its the most fascinating disease IMO, and I feel like the majority of people don't know how frightening it is."
1,Started getting Terraria vibes around  grimacing_face
1,There are medicines that treat brain eating amoeba if it's caught early
1,You guys might well be my most favoritest thing in the entire Universe. I am truly blessed for having experienced your videos during my existence.
1,I love how everyone forgot how deadly virus corona is
1,Is Steve canonically basically the duolingo bird?
1,Always here for every noti. Quality content
1,eww im never going swimming again
1,"Kudos to the guy/gal who animated the humans. It's a huge improvement over past videos. Great job! 

Besides, what a wonderful and terrifying entry this video is to the Kurtz series. 
Keep it up guys, you're the best!"
2,My god. Not only do Kurzgesagt make these incredibly interesting videos... This animation *chefs kiss*OK_hand. It just gets better and better.
1,Did the title change or am i tripping
1,Kurzgesagt scaring YouTube viewers since 2013 lol
1,What about the bacteriophage
1,"This is now my favourite video on YouTube, followed by your ‘How to Terraform Venus’ and ‘What do alien civilisations look like?’. The animation is simply amazing, and the music is crazy good, it adds an intense feel to this epic content during the ‘attacking’ moments. I can tell this took extremely long, but all that hard work pays off."
1,Question where did the Ant series go thinking_face I enjoy that series
1,This is actually what's being meant by atheists when they talk about chaotic disorder.
1,The end of your video when you try to get people to buy your stuff got me cracking up! I watched through it because it was funny! Way to go Kurzgesagt!
1,so your telling me to swim???????????
0,This just made me scared of water for a moment.

1,easy :GO iN THe FReeZer
1,"Damn, this starts off really, really dark, and I'm not just talking about that face at ! grinning_squinting_face"
1,Can't we use Giruses(Giant Viruses) against these Amoebas since Giruses hunt Amoebas
1,"Lol, lived in Florida for several years. There were signs posted in late summer, around lakes, saying that there was a possibility of contracting naegleria floweri if you swim in shallow water. Good stuff."
1,"i was completely HORRIFIED the whole video just waitting for the uplifting ending Kurzgesagt usually has

there was one, it didnt help"
2,"Hey, great animation winking_face"
1,"Thank you kurzgesagt, now i am semi terrified of open water"
1,Didn’t think it was possible but the animation got even better
1,"They changed the title from ""the most hyped parasite in the world "" or something like that to what it is now"
0,"Had a brain eating amoeba once, poor fella died of hungry"
1,I thought neutrophils are the most insane suicide super warriors get destroyed! That’s very insanesmiling_face_with_smiling_eyes

2,"Some of the animation has taken a nice step up, and it was already really good before. Good job thumbs_up"
0,You scared the living shut out me
2,I loved the Background music that created a sense like a war is going on! Well it is a war b/w our immune cells and invaders
1,A video on existential dread needs to be made considering how much of a recurring theme it is in Kurzgesagt videos
1," This is one of the reasons why I like this channel. The work into combining animation with information that, in some cases, not commonly asked about make me gravitate to this channel."
1,horrifying!really intresting!
1,The Most Horrible Parasite: Brain Eating Amoeba..... also known as mainstream media!
2,We love your content kurzgezagt slightly_smiling_face
1, I was not ready for this unusually realistic human face close-up
1,"Wait, is this the first kurzgesagt video with humans animated in it"
1,"As soon as i saw the brain part i started having a headache, i know I shouldn't be freaking out but it wont stop anytime soon."

1,"Was about to swim tomorrow, for the first time since winter, now I can't feel safe swimming..



Jokes aside, but 381 cases since 1937 sounds wrong, I have heard of this before and if the numbers are right my small city contributes to about 10 in the last maybe 5 years (not sure about the exact time period)."
1,"As someone who literally just finished a Microbiology exam which involves pathogenesis and the immune system, very interesting to see the pathogenesis of this amoeba, and thinking about the steps in which it can avoid complement activation and antibodies. I wonder if the mechanisms are similar to what I learned, does it use a protease? Are there any surface proteins that mimic regulatory proteins? Fc receptors? So many questions!"
1,"Ahh, the Disney Brain Eater."
1,This video is so fucking loud. Most youtube videos are the same volume at certain settings. I had to turn the volume way down.
1,The animation in this one was pinched_fingers_light_skin_tone

1,"Sweet, I'm going to the lake tomorrow!"
1,I made a mistake watching this video.
1,"the flesh eating one’s aren’t much better. my mom knew a lad who contracted it & even tho he was fine beforehand his body struggled to fight it off, this was with the best medical care of 90s US. he was hospitalized for like 6 months with loads of antibiotics & skin grafts, they cut out the badly infected bits & attached the grafts over the now open “lesions”. he has terrible crater scars all over his body, the dermis is kind of “compressed” down in some places. it’s all there,regrew back, just squished & very “strawberry’y”. the lake he contracted it from now undergoes extensive monitoring & millions of dollars of chemical treatments to decrease the chances of it happening again. i swam there, was pretty mid due to all the boats."
2,"I love how kurzgesagt causes existencial horror just to tell you ""Nah, you are ok """
1,Well thanks I will never touch a body of water that does not consist of large amounts of cleaning fluid (bleach)
1, Is this the first time Kurzgesagt has animated a somewhat realistic face?
2,I love the sound and music design in this episode!
1,"""It's like burning down a forest to kill the wolves inside it"" LMAO"
1,"This is extremely dreadful and scary!!! It easily causes a panic pensive_faceface_screaming_in_fear  Bay the way!! Am I the only one who noticed a human in this channel videos for the first time!!!?!
Also why worsening the situation and put that scary end evil?!

1,good thing I have 0 brain cells

1,"*If you liked this episode of Kurzgesagt,* 100% you MUST watch House M.D. (the TV Show) which had a two episode show on Naegleria Fowleri, Season 2 Episodes 20 & 21.

House did a great job depicting what was said here on Kurzgesagt.  One of the main doctors actually gets infected & the ensuing symptoms are absolutely horrifying.  Since then, the term Naegleria has stuck with me.  It made me never want to get into any body of water. But as mentioned by Kurzgesagt, the chance of infection is very small.  Its just God forbid if someone is infected...."
2,This is interesting
1,This video isn't about the coof? I'm shocked.
1,I might regret watching this but i can't miss a kurzgesagt video ..
1,thankfullllly im invincible cuz i dont blow my nose
2,Nice info

1,hey man if it does come into my brain it only has 1 brain cell to eat
1,Somehow it seems even more scary now that I know what it does
1,"You know what.....
I never really liked swimming that much anyways"
1,A perfect video to watch before I go to sleep
1,"Great, I had plans to go to the pool in a few days, nevermind!"
1,I'm worried it will develop something that makes it more deadly and more likely to enter ur brain

1,I have to say the animation has gotten way better lately...At  the animation for the moth was outstanding!! and the music in the background when he's explaining how the immune system fights the parasite was amazing!!star-struckstar-struck Keep up the good work.
1,Can we appreciate how this this the first time they've added pupils to a bird?
2,Interesting ad ;p
1,"Ahh, anxiety."
1,just burn me alive at that point
1,"I think I might actually have this,  had a headache, followed by nausea and then fever."
1,"Just for a note for people who are overly-scared of pathogens: there are nose clips/(or more effective) nose covers on swimming goggles.

I find it's more annoying to wear them, but hey, at least your brain isn't being chomped at."
2,"Lol, imagine having existential dread and not just focusing on the task at hand."
1, First birb with pupils maybe? Very cute~
1,umm I don't feel so good..
1,i thought this video was going to be about world leaders/
1,"I love how this video describes a lethal, brain-eating amoeba like a guy that was just chilling in a lake, having fun, and slightly inconvenienced when it entered someone's nose, probably seeing a bunch of tiny soldiers trying to shoot him down but just shrugging and saying ""ok"", and when that guy saw a Golden Corral full of LSD only then did he go crazy and mutate. Like, if this amoeba was a person and it didn't enjoy acetylcholine, I'd bet that he'd be a pretty fun person to hang around with, but the reason everyone is afraid of him is that he is defined as a ""deadly, zombie-like, brain-eating cannibal"" after someone heard that he hallucinated a person's head as a walking pile of pizza slices and unconsciously underwent a horrifying mutation. Specifically about 12 years ago."
1,Did we just witness the narrator's bird reveal?
1,So. Nose plugs then?
1,Yessss cant wait to watch it and the animation is  even better then the last episode
1,"Gosh, i'm so terrified but also feeling informed by the explanation from kurzgesagt..grinning_face_with_big_eyesrolling_on_the_floor_laughing"

1,"You are what you eat, so what's eating you?"
1," through sheer evolutionary badluck ...
Stealing that phrase grinning_squinting_face"
1,"This video is in my notifications but not in my subscription box, nice job YouTube"
1,Immune system's response to this ameba is basically the response of every military in a kaiju move (see: nukes).
2,"Wow, they really stepped their game up in the animation department. Like, WOW. Excelent job as always In a Nutshell"
1,you guys should consider making a game called Immune System.
1,"Kind of interesting though, we look at it as this amoeba killing us. But really we kill each other. When we die, so too do the amoeba. Unlike bacteria and viruses which benefit from this arrangement by having us expel countless clones of themselves to infect others and begin the cycle anew. This amoeba sees no such benefit. Every amoeba and everyone of their descendants die along with us. Mutually assured destruction if you will. 

Take it as a small win or an oddly beautiful death dance. But interesting to note either way"
1,There were ~400 cases of this since 1930 but 1000 stories about it in the comments
1,"i will put a nose stop in my nose, so we will be safe"
2,"Congratulations, you winned most certain death lottery"
1,Their animation has gotten so much better
1,"So, we put Chlorine in pools.  It can be derived from Salt (NaCl).  Bleach is diluted Chlorine...  Interesting fact... WW2 saw the first use of Chlorine in a gas state. Huh."
1,"I am absolutely terrified of this disease. I am trying to figure out more about it since today I got some lake water up my nose. In my state, there was a girl who died a few weeks ago from the disease in a lake not too far away so I am panicking..."
0,damn that thing is a monster
1,"Lesson learned: when you have nausea or a headache or you swim in a pool or you have the other symptons, ALWAYS SEE THE DOCTOR!




Edit: wow i never had so many likes"
2,"How is this channel this good, like it's scary how good it's getting"
1,I am really curious how did this organism was able to evolve to cause this brain eating behavior?
2,"Damnnn, these animations just keep on getting better and better"
1,"A few years ago a mam in my community died from this disease after swimming in the river. He was immune comprised,  so he probably shouldn't have been swimming there considering, but here in rural Alabama hanging out by the river is a common passtime."
2,"Good animation keep it up but please, keep the humans like there where before"
1,"These videos of epic battles between nonhuman things, such as the ant videos or immune system videos, are always my favorite :)"
1,Telling me that I shouldn't be worried about it isn't stopping me from worrying about it.
2,"For me, this is the best channel on youtube, it does never disappoint. It's always an overwhelming experience"
1,"Romans  states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans  states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell."
2,You are a genious! Great work.
2,Swimming in the ocean is alright though yeah

1,"""a man jumped into a river, this is what happened to his brain"""
1,Hey all
1,"Oh right, I heard about these in middle school, and now I'm even more concerned :)"
1,"I was so surprised and felt scary!
I never thought Kurzgesagt make a scary video like this (but this video was exciting as usually"
1,AND IRONICALLY DISNEY HAS HAD DEATHS CAUSED BY THIS FORM OF INFECTIOUS AMEBIA... BUT DONT WORRY... UNLESS YOUR TEACHING YOUR KIDS TOO WORSHIP SATEN OR SWIMING IN INFECTED WATERS OR RIDING DISNEY WATER RIDES BEING LIKE A DISNEY VILLEN OR ILLUMINATI SADIST... IN WHICH CASE BEWARE OF GODS WRATH...

1,"Great, another reason to hate Summer with every fiber of my being!"
1,"Man.... How the heck do you fight an amoeba. It's not a bacteria I think. So antibiotics won't work. We are so lucky amoebas don't hunt humans. But if one does, and thrives. Yikes."
1,"Hello Kurz, we need you to keep going red_heart"
1,What about microphages? I'm kinda curious about what would happen if you introduced pages to this amoeba

Also ALWAYS use Distilled or boil water for 5 minutes and let cool if you ever use a Neti Pot.
Distilled water you can find everywhere for super cheap, no minerals in it to hurt your sinuses during a wash AND no baddies."
1,I don't know why but naegleria fowlri looks like red among us character.:-)

1,"despite the fact the immune system fully engages the amoeba causing large collateral damage, I think that it is the right call. The immune system most likely recognises the massive threat the amoeba presents and probably knows that if it does not make sure it is wiped out the host will die (unfortunately this usually happens because of how effective the amoeba is at fighting the immune system)"
1,Kurzgesagt you're like the type of guy to tell me a House is on fire then telling me the stove was just open.
2,I love the ART and style of these videos! Very unique and attractive. Keep em comin! :)

1,If it thrives in the hot can't you lower the body temperature with ice to help your immune system or will that slow your immune system more than the amoeba even if your immune system is affected more than the amoeba maybe you could also use antibiotics
1,i wonder if this thing can be manipulated to create a bio weapon or some sort of poison thinking_face and what are the chances that this thing evolves into something actively searching for our brain? (or other animals too)
1,"I do thing a bit of Existential Dread is healthy as it allows you to see the world around you in a vastly different light whether it be your inevitable death at the hand of one of the billions of ways to die, The potential of a global catastrophe like an asteroid impact or nuclear Armageddon, or the understanding that you and your problems are sooooo unbelievably small in comparison to the universe around us. all of these help us realize just how pointless things like the Colour of our skin, what Language we speak, what God or Gods we believe in,  and near what Flag we happen to  reside truly are."

1,"more people die from the black plague each year, a 200 year old virus kills 1000-2000 people a year, so if we arent even talking about the black death much and even catching it then this shouldnt be much of a problem yet, expecially now we atleast know it exists"
1,So rare to happen yet when it gets in it demolishes the immune system and kills the host. Strange but then again the environment it lives in is likely just as dangerous just less backed with food.

1,Does anyone have suggestions for this channel? (Btw not saying Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell's channel is bad)
1,"Kurzgesagt, but what if the posters don't cause existential dread, but instead cause a massive hatred towards the establishment due to the lack of progress towards finally actualizing the things in the posters in real life?"

1,I leartned more in this video than i learned in 2 weeks in science class and btw a new fear unlocked:WATER
1,"How to make kurzgesagt vide:
1. Scare the shit out of viewers
2. Give them some comforting words after traumatizing them for the rest of their life."
1,My Favorite part of the video: 
1,The show Monsters Inside Me had a few episodes about these guys or amebas likes them and boy were they terrifying as a kid. Every patient died and I never wanted to go to freshwater JUST because of these things. This was an awesome video as always!
1,"*Not me squirming in fear about that one time I accidentally inhaled pool water*
Edit: nah im safe ig? its been years since then and not a thing happened, I guess I should thank my immune system"
2,"I like dread, I wish I could see him here sometimes"
2,wow nice this look good
1,"This is the one that Eric Foreman caught in an episode of House M.D. They did a biopsy on him and he had minor aftereffects, mostly memory related."
1,I'm getting distracted by the awesome background music all the time...
1,Kurzgesagt after making this video: Good luck sleeping tonight or going in a pool.
2,"I think the solution is bacteriophage. Aside from this, the animations are getting better and better!"
2,Well that was terrifying.
1,good thing i dont have one :D im safe
1,Anyone else find Kurzgesagt's Immune system vs invader battle scenes more entertaining than most action movies?
1,"This video is amazing and i love it, as i do all of them, but i cant help but feel genuinely disturbed by some of the 3D modelling and imagery, purely by the emotions on the characters faces! Even so, great video, cant wait to see what comes next <3"
1,As if I didn't need another reason to not want to swim skullmelting_face
1,"OHHHHHHHHHHH so thats what happend to my brain cells, help i only have 3 left"
1,Makes me grateful I hate swimming and being in any after besides a hot tub or my bath lol
1,"I don't like it when things go inside my body, especially when it's trying to eat my brain"
1,i fell abused by having a second voice speaking in a kurzgesagt video.
1,it’s pretty coincidental that i had just finished my parasitology test when i saw the video
2,"damn amazing Animation, and a very interesting topic"
1,My sister actually died from this. I'm glad people are starting to learn about it now so soon we might be able to prevent stuff like this from happening.
1,"So as long as I don't inhale water, I'm fine?"
1,"your's immunology books is osam
its fells like marvel movies,,  i just sit with popcorns and told to AI to read,"
1,"so this is why some people i see have very few braincells, they all got eaten by this amoeba"
1,Don't tell Dr Fauci. He may research it and turn it into a bioweapon through gain of function.
1,"Damn imagine a country eventually learning how to use microscopic entities as weapons - either to kill or to cripple economies/control politics and creat supply/demand out of nowhere….
Oh wait …"
1,About 5 people get it every month
1,"I dont have this bc when i was in vietnam i swam 5 times,
Now its been 2 months and nothing has happened"
1,so this amoeba is everywhere
1,i forgot how pleasant your videos can be when not sponsored by the gates foundation
0,I wonder if a phage could kill it
2,"The MOTHS
They look SO COOL!!"
0,Amoeba is literally that one kid who accidentally entered to wrong class

1,Did anyone else feel something in their head while watching this?
1,"The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important."

1,"In my country we had a case 4 years before, a family was infected in a pool"

I care deeply about pollution and habitat destruction, I have a reverence for plants and animals other people hate, like hornets or flies, and all around I have a respect for the roles organisms play in their ecosystem and think they should be preserved.

Except parasites. I have 0 reverence for parasites. To me, parasites are the natural selection equivalent of criminals, only allowed to exist because something hasn't stopped it yet. They, for the most part, contribute nothing of their own and are exclusively harmful and I think, unlike other varieties of organisms, we'd be far better off without most of them."

1,"So it has to go up your nose. 


Good thing I wear a mask when I swim. Cause I hate the feeling of water up my nose. 

I assume it can only be the nose since ears are basically closed systems"
1,I have a headache stiff neck a fever and sore throat I’m scared I’ve been swimming in dirty water please pray for me and I’m dizzy
1,"For anyone still worried, they specified that the amoeba can only exist in *dirty* waters. Just don't jump into some random lake or a pool that isn't cleaned out regularly and you're fine. You're not likely to splash around in a spa since you're supposed to be relaxing, not going nuts, and when they say 'high in your nose' they MEAN high in your nose. As in, you can feel it in the bottom of your eyes kind of high. And that's a serious problem all on its own since that probably means you've inhaled some water into your lungs and you've got a DIFFERENT situation going on."

1,"Whoa, narrator face reveal!"
2,I really love the last clip
1,This parasite is up there with the MSM
1,"Mann, I don't know what's best from this video. The music or finally the duck reveal of the narrator!"
1,"Is this why people can't smell when they think they have covid, and it could already have infected million, and the governmentjust kept saying it was covid to keep this under the radar? You guys pretty much predicted covid, but maybe this was happening along side covid and they didn't want to cause a major panic? Idk I like to smoke and to think outside the box a little too much, I could be wrong, ngl."
2,The animation is so good in this video!! Great job guys!!

1,I think I can use this as a convincing argument against my friends who loves to plan trips on lake/river swimming instead on beaches
2,All the music was cool in this one
1,"Now that was a banger add, on top of a banger video! Well done!"
1,I absolutely love the new approach to advertising they took at the end.

1,"it's great that these amoebas are getting more awareness, most people don't really know that these little guys exist and that's probably part of why it takes so long to identify an infection"
0,Scared
1,The first thumbnail reminded me of Till Lindeman from Rammstein's new music video.
1,The animation quality just keep on getting better huh.
1,You know it’s going to be good when it starts with “A war has been going on for millions of years
1,I wasn't planning on sleeping tonight anyway

1,"Pls, do yourself a favor, be brave and watch til the end... you'll be relieved"
0,Death by being unlucky
2,That visualization was super scary and horrifying to be honest.
1,Its so unfortunate this shouldn’t even end up in your brain. It feeds on tissues and it indirectly eats your brain tissue. You must have been VERY VERY VERY UNLUCKY person.
1,"One day my friend that uses twitter was infected with this brain-eating amoeba, it was very sad, the amoebas died from hunger days later."
2,I hope they don't kill me
1,Who's from India India
1,"A couple years ago, a girl died from this amoeba at the US National White Water Center in CLT, NC. Now the channels are chlorinated and many people wear nose plugs when kayaking and rafting."
1,"finally,. brain rot"
1,Poor amoeba. They are going to starve if they enter my brain.
1,quack red_heartduck
1,I’ve watched this channel for a long time and I love how you guys aren’t like other channels. You make the videos PURELY for education. Your animations are unique and your videos are easy to understand. People are getting annoyed of me spewing out random facts from this channel XD

0,now  i have water phobia
2,I had something like this in spore
1,I'm not worried I got nothing left for them to eat
1,Just a thought but you guys should think about releasing a dust pad. Maybe like an image from your posters or something unique. I know I would definitely be interested in one and I imagine others would be too.
1,Most epic fight scene made yet
1,"This was in Disney back then i think
Thats why they closed down the petting island

THANK YOU."
1,It's amazing to see how Kurzgesagt's animation improves each video. I was stunned with the moth scene at the start of the video.
1,Now this quickly escalated from a summer party to A Complete Horror Movie!
1,For once in my life I'm actually glad I can't swim
1,Kurzgesagt acknowledging their ability to give me more dread than any horror movie I've ever seen
1,and it seems to give the same symptoms as what a zombie infection would give you beforehand. not surprised really.
2,what the heck was that ad lmao
1,"The more I see these videos, I feel like I'm accessing the forbidden side of knowledge, bit, by, bit.
Good one, as always."
1,"To all the new Kurzgesagt viewers, if you find it difficult to find a video where humans don't die or the Earth is not torn apart, that's cause there is not."
1,The victims are easily identifiable . . . they are called politicians.
1,Is no one gunna talk about how dope the ending was
1,I have it when i was at the beach 3 months later nothing happednd
1,Kurzgesagt animators animated a human face! I thought they were all birds!
1,That animation is so crisp now OK_hand
1,"KUUUUUURRRRTZZ!!!
  My excitement when you guys drop a new video, is equal to Billy Madison’s excitement for brown paper bag day!"
2,"Thanks for this, ignorance really is bliss."
1,Beautiful animation in this one. Stunning as always!
1,"I'm no doctor but it seems like it's desire for heat could be used against itself. If somehow detected before crossing blood-brain barrier it seems like an ice bath might be effective. Obviously won't regenerate brain tissue, but might save a life especially if caught early enough. A drug induced coma combined with drastic lowering of body temperature seems a good first step, then maybe something like plasmapheresis to help force it out of the body faster? We can also create acetylcholine in a lab, with the right setup maybe we could entice the organism to leave the brain for this new and more plentiful source. Something like plasmapheresis but with an extra step that allows the organism to reach the bait without flooding you with acetylcholine. Would be extra effective if the bait is 100°+ and body temp below 80° giving more incentive to go for the bait."
1,IM SCAREDcold_facecold_facecold_face
2,I love the mini clip at the end
1,"Between this and rabies, I cant tell what is worse."

0,Hate the new human animation
1,"Ironically, i was thinking about this Amoeba while washing my face, and now that you brought it up, it'll continue to be on my mind each time I wash my face for about a month..."
1,"-gosh, your animations keep getting better and better, the boy's face was really well done!
-it would come across way better if you managed to decide on a clickbait title winner before publishing and not editing titles after the fact.
-""my existential dread shows me kurzgesagt merch so i may feel small and worthless, but its intent backfires since i am actually in awe of science, facts and logic? that is so relatable!!!"""
0,Why is existential dreads frame rate so low?
1,I wonder how to prevent this. I mean I never liked swimming in lakes in general but just wondering. Also I heard they can be in shower water
1,"Oh hey, the ever looming existential dread on this channel has a face now! I want to pet it and give it cuddles."
1,"why not just advise people to wear diving masks with nose covers when they go swimming? even if the chance to be infected by brain eating amoeba is low what about other diseases? it gets annoying how often people don't use protective items. wear sunglasses while driving on a bright day, wear ear protection when performing in a band, wear a helmet when riding a bike, and a closed face helmet when riding a motorcycle. doing this stuff will prevent so much harm but people seem to value their ego and self image more than their safety."
2,this is really interesting. and love the skit in the end even for advertizing.
1,Didn't the video originally call this the most overhyped parasite ever?
1,"Hey, people who supported Amber Heard are immune from this brain eating amoeba"
0,"Good now i cant swim


Thx God (edit)"

1, this sounds like an omori meme
1,"Lesson:
Don’t cannonball in the poo poo water"
1,Kurzgesagt's animation is as exquisite as ever. Thank you for your introduction. There are materials for tonight's nightmare face_screaming_in_fear
1,"Wait, does this mean that there's another narrator in these videos after about 7 years? Never thought this would happen."
1,"Wow I haven't looked at any of your videos in awhile, but I follow. Always informative,  but your animations have gotten so much better and it helps bc I'm  a visual learner. I like de-hype train too, sensationalsing things comes off as corporate imo. Cheers!"
2,well I’m never swimming again
1,I am just horrifed i just always swimmed in pools when i watched your video it was so shocking.
2,I watched the animation like it was a war lol
1,Well...this terrified me just in time for summer

1,im ded a lot of water enter my nose im scard
1,"You guys have grown so freaking much, while horrifying, the quality of the education and cinematography of this video was freaking amazing"
1,"This was educational, engaging and in a nutshell, excellent. thumbs_up"
1,I know how to fix this! Snort clorox
1,I'm genuinely curious how you've done those 3D looking animations. Is it actually 3D models with fancy shaders or just smartly animated and layered 2D sprites?
1,That ameoba is just built different.

1,"Everyone: **tortured by existential dread**
Kurzgesagt: **capitalizes off of existential dread**"
1,"Nice educational work from Kurzgesagt usually, but I am a bit worried about the choice of subjects. My alarm bells were already ringing when the ""Climate change"" topic was analyzed first to point out that it is impossible to ""fight it"", quickly followed by a correction video explaining just the opposite, that it is possible to fight it... It showed how politically motivated the choice of topic was in the first place, and how even science has to tip-toe to please the ""sponsors"", and not to scare people or make them apathetic. So, a pessimistic video followed by an optimistic one, on the same subject. Hm. Eyebrows raised... and now this, a clearly fantastic, masterful SCAREMONGERING video, Hollywood style? I really hope that these abominations are only the exception, and there will be better, less emotionally ""appealing"" topics chosen in the future. I really hope that mankind has not yet degraded to the level where only this kind of scare- and fear-mongering can induce someone to watch a professional animation about science. Peace"

1,"Actually, this not only comes when you go to water but prawns grown in such water contains that bacteria. When we buy that prawns this bacteria remains in skin leftovers. Here we have some mafia families around my house which includes Muslims, Christians, and hindus. So they use unaudible high and low frequencies to force this bacteria into brain via sinus and ears. They are terrorists who are trying to kill me. When I try to report to police they called me mentally ill. Indian government will not care if the victim is other than OC caste. I request international anti terrorist agencies to investigate the plots to kill me using infected prawns other and food and unaudible low and high frequency sounds.

I came upon the channel two months ago and I think I've watched every video you have grinning_squinting_face. So the UBI video (fantastic btw ) ,got me thinking what would happen if it was like scaled up. Like not only we're you given a basic salary but also basic housing, clothing, medical care, recreational services, alternative education and every other basic amenity for free but here is the catch, you're not allowed to make any profit. If you're going to work you ""work"" for the fun of it not expecting anything in return."

1,"I had a mysterious brain injury about 5 years ago I got while in rural Mexico, that I believe was due to using a neti pot with warm tap water. I was in pretty bad shape for several years, and recovery was far slower than I expected. The damage showed up on the MRI, and the attending neurologist believed it was from a pathogen like this. I'm still not 100%, probably about 90% though, which is far more than I thought I'd recover just a few years ago."
2,Wish the animation tho
1,Still waiting for immune system3... if that ever happenes
1,These are crazy and I know cause there was a brain eating amoeba in a lake by my house at a time where we would swim and that day we went swimming and got out of the lake to find out that the amoeba was in the lake and killed 3 people that day. If your curious of which lake it was. It's called lake of the arbuckles in Sulphur oklahoma and by the end of the day I think the amoebas claimed 7 peoples life don't quote this on me but I do think it was above 5 and that's been around 7 years ago so things might be a blurry
1,POV: you are a little late but not that much :

1,"I have been watching Kurzgesagt videos for 4 years now, and I have got to say, not once has it disappointed me. In fact, it has sparked my interest in so many things, and helped me with university assignments quite a lot. The way of explanation, the animation, the music, the voice of the narrator, everything just fits in perfectly. Students should be made to watch this. Really, really great job! I also have a suggestion for a video. Someone mentioned to me recently that new innovations and technology have done nothing but made us circle back to the time when there was no technology. Like we used books for research once, which one could lose easily, and now there is cloud based software which stores important data and can also be lost just as easily. Basically it is the fact that technology has not made any real impact on humanity and that we were the same without it, or even better off. I would love to see Kurzgesagt's take on this concept since I don't find myself agreeing to it but I also can see the meaning behind it."
1,This voice is like listening to an asmr
2,Great.. who need sleep anyway.

0,The fight was EPIC
1,"It seems simple, just use electricity on the brain, amoebas are extremely sensitive to current.

Sure, it might lobotomize the patient a bit but better be slow than dead"
1,"This is why I only swim underwater in the ocean. It's too salty for these buggers. Of all the scientific advances we've made, including a vaccine to help battle CoViD, we have no cure for brain eating amoeba. Rabies, once it's going, does something similar where it just eats your brain. Brain diseases are scary, especially with the computer jelly bring so vulnerable"

Making cars crashes, lighting or hell even drowing in a bubble bathtub far far far far far more likely.  Really interesting and unfortunate way to die, but nothing to worry about.  Humans always respond more to emotional info than statistical reality."

1,Never been sooo early [18s]
1,They have 2 episodes on this parasite in House MD
1,"What in the world??! What a wonderfully written, acted, and animated video."
1,"Does anyone else feel that Kurzgesagt is delving too much into rare-devastating-extinction-events-that-deliver-death-and-pain... but ultimately will basically never happen? I assume they get more views because people enjoy watching catastrophic stuff (Hollywood docet), but it don't feel like useful knowledge to have."
1,why is there an amongus at  ?
1,"Another great video, if not a little terrifying, but what about microbiology isn't already terrifying enough? Great job Kurgezagt team!~"

1,good now i will add 1 more reason not to swim :D
1,.     If it's ripping the bacteria into pieces....it can't be devouring them whole.
1,So just become cold or go someplace cold to defeat them
1,"See, my problem is in that I have a fully intact mammalian diving reflex, and while that certainly helps me to avoid drowning, it does mean that my nose gets filled up with water. Making it somewhat more likely that something gets where it shouldn't."
1,WTF is with the human animation on this one he is so much more detailed but still stylized and the movement looks so fluid it looks rly good
1,I never want that parasite in my brain.
1,The animation just keeps getting better and better. Absolutely unreal. Kudos.
1,"Great animation & explanations. There was a recent death case of the N. fowleri infection in Korea in Jan'23, the man happened to be returned from a four-month trip to Thailand, he did swim on the lake that time. He was having fevers, headaches, stiffness in the neck, vomiting, and even the loss of his ability to speak before pass-away."
1,I just love to know that I can die at a random point in time without knowing.
1,"This is the best video you've made by far. Great job Kurzgesagt, you guys always amaze me."

1,This is worse than thalassophobia
1,I must have been infected with a few of these around the age of 13.
1,Damn I really liked swimming... Guess no more of that this summer.
1,"finally, some emotion in the narrator's voice"
1,Insane that by sheer bad luck an Amoeba that lives off of bacteria have both the means and a reason to screw over any human it comes into contact with.
1,"Scary coincidence.... 
Yesterday I got small panic when I was lifting some metal pipes full of old standing water. When I lifted one above my head, I accidently poured warm-ish dirty water straight on my face. Some of the iron tasting water went in my mouth through my nose.

I was sure I will die within a week due something like this... I hope not

Edit: Im scared again"

1,always a good day when a new kurzgesagt video comes out
2,"Wow the animation in this video is amazing. Like  is just a huge flex, doing a scene like that in 2D animation is so hard! Especially with vector-based animation"
1,"I got freak out when water enters my nose, but i just realized the water that entered my nose is water that is treated properly"
1,IK I dont need to worry but I dont wanna go swimming ever again
1,you're more likely to die by lightning than this amoeba so dw y'all

1,"I absolutely love how you can see the animation quality change and improve as you go along the Kurzgesagt video timeline. It means that we're supporting them well enough for them to be able to afford to take more time to put more effort into higher quality videos.

1,"the main problem with this disease is the symptoms are so general. you just need to tell the doctors you swam. 
so many infections cause fever, headaches, and even seizures. 
i don't know if many infections cause the swelling of brain, but chances of a doctor asking for images to diagnose this swelling is low unless the symptoms are serious which is too late."

1,Parts of the music for this sound like Sandopolis zone from Sonic & Knuckles.
1,Welp now I’ll never go in a pool again I’m way to scared of this

1,Milestone in Kurzgesagt animation: First stylistic humanoid with accurate proportions (I think) to ever appear
1,"I didn't expect Kurzgesagt will upload about amoeba, I iust got amoeba and lasted for a month and until now I still have stomach ache, this video shows so many important information thank you Kurzgesagt"
1,i thought this was about liberalism
1,"Dude this channel's animation and art just keeps getting better, to think that a bunch of birds are able to make this :0."
1,Ayoooo this amoeba was in my community’s lake and it killed a kid that went to my school. It was really sad. We couldn’t swim in that lake all summer.
1,"LOL @ ""amoebea"" pronounced ""amoebee"" haha. To each amoebeum their own I guess./s"
1,Isn’t this the plot of Gunbuster
1,Well now I can't go swimming without thinking about this. Learning is fun!
1,"I remember when I first learned about it in 2020, I was so scared of it I once thought I was gonna die even though I was wearing goggles"
1,So really they're just some kids getting addicted to Marijuana chasing after people who use it medically
1,"I love your videos but i'll pass on this one, I don't wanna get traumatized"
1,you're more likely to contract brain-eating amoeba than win the lottery. think about that for a second...
1,"Ooh! I love these pathology videos. Maybe you could cover some more interesting diseases, like rabies or tetanus.

Edit: Oh! One of the most interesting topics that no one ever talks about is Prions."
1,Why do I have a feeling you hired or gave more artistic freedom to someone who watches anime?
1,"What was the point of the video? Sure it's an interesting process, but is that enough to justify scaring people? The statistics at the end did not help me - Yet another thing to worry about when I try to fall asleep..."
1,"Got a fatal infection? Just ""deal with it""."

1,See you guys several months from now
1,The existential dread monster looks like Finn’s ocean-fear monster that comes out of his belly in Adventure Time! ;D
1,This sounds like rabies. I feel that before all this sets in an average person would go to a health care provider and they'd jack them up on all kinds of steroids and immune boosting drugs to help fight off the virus.
1,I have watched all of your videos since the black hole the size of quarter came out. Your animations are stunning now! Thank you for teaching me all this stuff :)
1,Not first ;-;

2,the quality of your animations just keeps getting better. keep up the great work!
1,Are you the ship's computer on In Space With Markiplier?
1,It seems that amoeba following ACh as a means to enter the brain is more of a conjecture as it hasn’t been fully proved. Should this part be removed from the video?
1,"Imagine getting your brains eaten

This post was made by saltwater gang"
1,Would a nose-clip be effective in preventing an infection?
1,My state has a policy of bleaching the point of infection to the point it's rendered uninhabitable. Bit of a overreaction if ask me.

0,Existential Dread is brother of Fear of the Ocean from Adventure Time
1,"It's alright guys, the fact there has been only 400 cases from last year means that most people immune system knows how to defend against it. When you look at Covid, most people immune system couldnt fight against it well and so a lot of people died from it."
1,"The animation team is underrated, look at how smooth and high definition this whole video is"
1,maybe stop shoving sticks with cancer triggering chemicals on up your nose to your brain  on a daily basis can prevent something like this .

I have an autoimmune disease that causes me a lot of pain daily and pretty much any simple disease (if left untreated) triggers a domino effect on my body that ends up in statistic shenanigans, people usually takes 3 to five days to recover? In my body is ten to fifteen, a simple infection? Acts like a trigger for other opportunistic things to enter and make a mess. So, having such poor health, this definitely made my agoraphobia trigger further."

2,Wow that was horrifying
0,"I don't care how unlikely it is, a cureless disease that causes a miserable death in a week is still a higher priority than most things. I can avoid drowning easily but I can't avoid this amoeba if it manages to end up in my brain."

1,I really enjoyed the full 10minute video 1 minute after it’s release

Believe and have faith that Jesus is the only one that qualifies as our true Savior (John 14:6) and is the only way to the Father. All who truly call on Jesus will be saved (Romans ). Find a biblically based church, read the bible and do what it says. Have hope and peace in this world and the promise of eternity in heaven through the blood of Jesus."
1,"I was ready for the horrifying flesh-eating bacteria that quickly yet gradually destroys you from the inside.
I was ready for the comment section anecdotes for all the people who tragically have lost friends, family, and loved ones.
I was ready for Kurzgesagt to finally embrace and distil the despair and dread that makes their analyses of the universe around us such a miracle for which we should be thankful each and every day, regardless of our stance on the theories of design.

I was _not_ ready for Steve's fursona."

You racist, homophobic, abelist, transphobic bigots! If just one of the people from those deeply persecuted groups chooses to commit suicide as a result of feeling excluded by this video, then it's all your fault, and their deaths will be on your conscience. Shame on you!"

1,"Actually, amoeba can't swim unless it in it's flagellate stage, but this stage is rare and used only for sexual reproduction. 

Amoeba's locomotion is similar to a wheel: it needs surface to pull itself forward. So all amoebae are actually bottom-living creatures, that's why the disease is rare. You need really to shake and mix all the water and silt, so amoebae would be drawn closer to the surface, and then you have to really inhale the water to be infected. 

And our immune system has the weapons against it. It's just the time needed to kill all the infection is greater than you are able to survive."

1,"I really hope it doesn't come to Florida.
The poor thing will starve."
1,"I have to say your animation of the human outside of the bacteria was pretty disturbing. Considering this is a real event which occurs with some degree of frequency, showing the person in distress while their brain is getting eaten is pretty disturbing. I think in future keeping those shots to a minimum, preferably at the start of the video would help."

Hearing another voice besides the narrator in one of these animations is quite jarring, but fun as well. Amazing video overall, the detail has hit a critical point that is just incredible to look at"

1,that's why I'm not leaving my room

1,Wasn’t this called the most overhyped ammiba
1,This is funny. I was just planning on taking swimming lessons to learn how to swim so I can go to the beach. Now I don't want to anymore.
1,"So from what I have read. Because cases are rare it is difficult to develop a method to treat it when not many cases actually occur. However, I read up on the survivors. There were a few recent ones in 2013 and 2016. A girl was infected in 2013 and the treatment was to drop her body temperature. I guess the idea is if you can cool the amoeba it will either slow it down enough to give you immune system a chance or just outright kill it. They used the same treatment on the victim in 2016 and it seems to have worked because both victims survived with no neurological damage."

1,"ooooh this is so wild. i had covid in November 2020 and lost my sense of smell during it... which persisted well after recovery and has now come back as parosmia (basically, everything smells/tastes like rot or chemicals or both). Since this amoeba first attacks the olfactory nerve system, I wonder if studying something about it the specifics of the damage it causes could possibly assist in researching parosmia? It's also super curious that a lot of diseases, not just covid, can result in loss of smell/taste. Is the olfactory bulb just very susceptible to damage?"
1,"Wow, yall really kicked your animation game up several notches. It's hella noticeable and I'm digging it."

2,One of the most loved by me thing in Kurzgesagt is no ads!
1,I probably have a few of those
0,"i love how this amoeba sounds so deadly yet you're 690x more likely to die from drowning alone, not even including all the other ways to die in water"

1,"that ""could you not, please"" at the end is the biggest mood i've ever seen"
1,"It's just how this YouTuber has massively exaggerated amoeba. Only 154 people have ever gotten it (3 people a year in the US). So there is nothing to worry about, you only have a 0.000000906337% chance of getting Amoeba for those who are scared of getting it. There is a 97% chance of death but he didn't include that most of the people who got it were hosts with weak immune systems. Also, Amoeba doesn't thrive in typical lakes or pools, it thrives in still river sediment that must be higher than 46°C (115°F) (The heat of a hot bath). And your body's average temperature is 36°C (96.8F) and reaches a max of 42-43°C (107.6F). So your body wouldn't get warm enough for the amoeba to thrive. And there is a cure/antibiotic for amoeba. Metronidazole is the mainstay of therapy for invasive amebiasis. Tinidazole has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for intestinal or extraintestinal amebiasis.

I spent a long time researching amoeba after watching this video. I got this information from many proven professional sources.

(If you have symptoms of amoeba consult a doctor immediately).

Very lucky that the amoeba went to my stomach instead of my brain. Each night I would have extreme stomach pain, 9/10 felt like my stomach was contracting into a ball at the same time of being cut open. During the day completely fine, no headache, no other symptoms. Pediatrician found them and I was 2 weeks away from death usually kills you in a week or 2 if it goes to the brain about a month in the gastrointestinal . Goes to the brain wont know til it's to late, goes to anywhere else you'll know about a week in."

1,"I remember watching videos about this back in 2017. Just before this video was released, prions were talked about in my class and it reminded me of this disease and the video I watched about a boy who got it and died horribly. Then, a few hours later, I see Kurzgesagt uploaded a video about it. What a creepy coincidence. It's a creepy and nail-biting inducing disease, but it's so interesting. I didn't have time to watch this video until now, but I was already freaked out before even clicking it. What a horrible way to go."

1," just a guess but like you were saying, theyre used to some serious contenders, so even in a new ""pool"", contenders all the same will be treated as such from ones in water to ones in your own body 

ie. a gorilla normally would never run across a bear, but would more than likely put a solo wolf in its place pretty damn quick despite both being essentially/technically/not 100% but more than not on the top of their areas food chain 
a swarm of micro-gorillas very quickly puts our bio-wolves to shame"

1,If amoeba starts killing a hell lot of humans then evolution would start kicking in and eventually we would get a defense for them but uhhhhhhh I think we would be extinct before we evolve and amoeba would probably have a vaccine before we evolve to have defenses against them
1,"The parasite entameoba H is actually an more infectious and potentially deadlier parasite that is capable of killing more than 100 thousand humans per year, the habits of this parasite are indeed straight out of horror.
The parasite behaves like a vampire as well as behaving like a blob."

1,"Their stuff is pretty.
Their delivery company of choice (ups) is the worst. They just dump the package onto the normal snail mail and take no responsability whatsoever if it gets lost.  I bought a calendar.

1,hi. I love your videos. I know you already have an app in the app store but I think you guys should develop a kurzgesagt game. You could have people be able to build a mars base and a Dyson sphere or you could let them solve problems on earth. Everybody loves your graphics. The possibilities are endless. Thank you.
1,"Got it, always wear swim goggles that cover nose"
1,"I was swimming in a pool yesterday. Now I'm scared, thanks kurzgesagt."
1,"Kurzgesagt, let me know when you want to collaborate on that Tower Defense game where the player controls the immune system. Seriously, let's talk! ;)"

1,"This one definitely hit home. Back in high school in the summer of 2015, I had a teammate named Michael Riley in cross country who tragically passed away from this exact disease. 

We had a meet at huntsville, Texas. Right after our competition, we swam in a lake not far from where the meet was. The scary part was that any one of us could’ve gotten this disease and unfortunately Michael was diagnosed with this disease. It was on the news and it was definitely a dark time for our team."

0,Not profitable no treatment. At least in the US of shit.
1,Most terrifying parasite in the world in my opinion. Even worse than the elephantiasis worms. The fact that almost no one survives and it can be contracted by simple water up the nose gives me anxiety just thinking about it.
1,This Chanel teach you things without you knowing beating_heart

1,"I knew about this brain eating amoeba before, but in that book it only said that they exist in hot waters like fresh-water springs, not swimming pools or on the beach. Now I'm afraid of going in contact with water now, especially because water keeps going up my nose, either from normal swimming, or from other people splashing me."

1,I wish you would include actual pictures in your videos of the bacteria and what not but love your videos and excited for the next one
1,"I was thinking the video was being very sensationalist, so I'm glad you specified how rare it is at the end. If I could recommend a similar topic to make a video about, I'd definitely suggest the more frequent bacterial meningitis. It's very possible to cure as long as the diagnose is made early, and has very recognisable symptoms. I think a channel as large as yours sharing that information in an easily accessible way could genuinely save quite a few lives slightly_smiling_face"

1,I’m never swimming as often every again
1,"I'm not swimming in a pool anymore.
I never noticed this parasite until I watched this video."
1,"I think there is some kind of brain eating ameoba going around, and I have a cure for it, but unfortunately it will be hard to cure, 

Honestly, Cannabis and some legumes, and certain mushrooms keep things like this away.

Without it the amoeba causes repetitive, fear-based behaviors, like getting close to hear your neighbors conversation, so you know they aren't talking behind your back, thus spreading the disease by breath to breath contact. 

And it affects police officers mostly, they not only don't take medecine, they criminalize it.

It's almost like they are concious of it, and spread it on purpose, but that's the brain eating part.

They are like ants affected by cordyceps, and by criminalizing the cure, the disease wins.

To them, the disease is a friend."
1,"Would Existential Dread be voiced by Corpse Husband, I'd love it"
2,"Wow, the animation is amazing!!!!"
1, the scale would be even smaller
1,"Important caveat to ""Not a major public health risk"": unless you are from certain communities in southern Louisiana and elsewhere. Two of the Parishes near me are where N. fowlerii infections are notably common, and there has been a public health advisory out about them for some time now. Also, drinking water testing for N. fowlerii is only a recent phenomenon, so it is an open question just how common it is. Based on the pattern of deaths and lack of unexplained deaths fitting that pathology, it's not likely to be vastly more common... but we also have to put an asterisk of ""our knowledge in this area is limited"" next to statements like that if we're being totally transparent. 

(I have a bit of a background in this is why I even bring it up)"
1,i think about this every time water gets up my nose and i really shouldn’t

1,Eo what now? i dont think you mentioned that cell in the book...
1,"So what actually kills you here is the consequences of your immune system fighting with a scorched earth policy? If yes, what exactly would happen if the immune system would not intervene? How fast would the amoeba itself kill you by eating your brain cells? I imagine it would be a few weeks to months of your brian functions degrading more and more instead of a rather ""quick"" death due to inflammation?"

I started the dreadcoaster by finding my nsf58 2 stage water filter has a 5 micron filter level and this thing is 7-15 microns in size.  The filter also reduces cysts... Well temp is 68F max which is typically too low for it to thrive.  Maybe I'm safe, then the stress headache.... Why does my brain do this?!  Anyone else have moments like this too?"

Can you please put some kind of warning in the description or video.

1,"Why? why? why do creatures like that brain eating amoeba exist? They're only purpose is to cause pure suffering and agony to other beings, which are levels much larger than they are. If there is irrefutable proof of the existence of a divine being responsible for creating the Earth and all organisms that resideon this planet, I refuse to believe that this aforementioned divine being would allow these brain eating amoebas to exist. The only way that it would be allowed to exist is under pure malice and desire for creatures to suffer. It would be no surprise that humans will eventually devote all their time and energy towards the contribution to driving these brain eating amoebas towards extinction. Technologies will be developed to filter out entire bodies of fresh water for the sole purpose of extermination of these deadly parasites and make sure not a single individual brain eating amoeba or any other deadly parasitic creature makes it out alive. Imagine a mass genocide of microorganisms just because their existence depends upon the suffering of other creatures, especially multiple multicellular organisms. It's not the matter of what will be targeted, or when will they start this process of mass eradication, or why they must each single individual must be annihilated. All that was needed is motivation to justifiably commit mass genocide on brain eating amoebas and every other deadly parasitic microbe and make sure that each one gets eliminated out of everywhere on earth.
Brain eating amoebas should not exist, yet they somehow do."

Thankfully this is just my imagination. The amoeba is neither malevolent, nor a serious threat, scary as it may be that it has evolved (purely by accident) able to 'commit a crime' against its own best interest (and ours!!!)

Honestly it just makes me reflex on micro biologic morality and lemme tell you it is GREY."

1,"There was a boy at my elementary school that died from this (Yes, this happened in Florida). He was a fifth grader when I was a kindergartner, so I didn't personally know him, but what I do remember was that the school would hold a vigil for him every year for a few years in remembrance of him, and that the vigil was always spiderman-themed, since the kid apparently loved spiderman.

Unbelievable pain. When my mom was carrying me to the bathroom every time I have urinated I passed out, no medication turned effective, I have no idea what the hell was that."

1,"Look at those animations, Kurzgesagt is getting even better."

1,"You need to make a video about how the Chinese government has been manipulating the political and social networks of the United States. And if you actually do real research on this you would see that nearly 65% of democrats in the house and senate have assests or businesses in China. And because of that they make laws or regulations that benefit their businesses versus the country they're serving. You can make it all pretty and use your little birds to explain how this is a conflict of interest. And even go into detail about their Treasonous intentions. Ya know, cause they're trying to change our form of governing, and our culture to line their pockets better. I can even link you to some really good research thats 100% facts. So are up for the task? Or are you just another example of a spineless greedy, youtuber afraid to speak out against the oppressive government in China."

1,"this video actually gave me neurosis. no joke, i had panic attack and i was scared of this thing a lot, i wasnt scared of swimming in the lake itself, i was scared of this thing. now i feel better, and after some time this wasnt no longer the thing that made my neurosis not go away. like 2 weeks later i began being scared of not being able to controll impulses. but now my neurosis is pretty much gone, but i wont look at water the same way as before"

She went to an indoor pool during July 21st to July 24th, and on the 26th she started having headaches, neck stiffening, and fever. She passed away on August 1st.. it sent chills down my spine. I shared your video to my family and friends, but too bad it doesn't have Traditional Chinese subtitles. I sure hope one day someone could help translate your videos so more people can benefit from these useful information. Thank you very much for making this video, you did an excellent job! Thank you."

1,"Not gonna lie, I'm kinda weirded out seeing regular people in this art style."
1,I almost couldn’t watch the video because the music is D O P E and I got distracted
1,"This was horrifying and hilarious at the same time....my favourite combination!
Also assassination Idea: give someone cocaine or meth that is spiked with brain eating Amoebas."
2,Great.
1,"Whoever at kurzgesagt dropped this banger of a soundtrack needs a raise fr, this shit is heat throughout the whole video. Was to busy bopping to be horrified."

1,"Hey Kurzgesagt, I'm not sure if you touched upon it in a past video but could you do a deep dive on diabetes? I was just diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in September 2021, and being 22 years old it was a huge shock that came out of nowhere and total adjustment to my lifestyle. Since then I've thought about possibly changing my career path to research diabetes because it's super interesting to learn about what's going on in my body. Love the channel and have been watching and learning for years! Here's to knowledge, cheers!"
0,"That episode from House M.D. was really horrible. Extreme pain through the entire body where sedatives and pain killers are useless, and even if you're put in coma, you are still in pain in coma."

1,"watched this an hour before attending a pool party. got water up my nose multiple times. 
hopefully, i wont die a week from now."
1,My favorite game is to guess where the 3D CGI animation was used instead of the usual 2D. In this video I think it was the Moths to a flame analogy
2,thanks! I'm horrified!
1,looks like im not going to the beach this summer
1,"What is this? A Kurzgesagt video without the existential dread?

Oh no, nope, they gave it a voice now. Nope."
2,Sounds like a good bioweapon
1,Good thing that everyday I wake up get cold so the amoeba won’t like it
1,So it’s a virus that makes you lose iqs
1,"So this brain eating cell is like a shark, scary but rarely die from it"
1,"Man another time you do video that will make my anxiety go up,you will lose a folower"

1,"BSE (Mad cow disease) has a fatality rate of 100%, no cures, but it is very very rare. Rabies virus also has 100% fatality rate, it becomes incurable before one of the first symptoms shows up, so don't let it progress in your body. Those two are the only ones with 100% fatality rate. Our immunity system is really a marvel of evolutionary engineering, there is a report that a person survived a Rabies virus without vaccination or treatment."

1,Am I the only one here that would buy an existential dread plushie?
1,ok im closing my nose next time i swin
1,"Hey Kurzgesagt! I, as I'm sure most viewers, really appreciate the extra effort put into making dope diagrams and super colorful, great-looking drawings of amoebas. Keep it up, please :)
I think the supersaturated color scheme and intuitive and intriguing models are some of the main reasons I like you guys' videos so much. 

But there's something about that model of the young guy, particularly at , that just... haunts me a little bit. It seems a little out of place in a Kurzgesagt video. Maybe it's a little overly realistic, maybe a bit too expressive, but it doesn't really seem to fit in with the general style of your videos. So I was wondering whether you decided to start taking the style of your illustrations in a different direction, or it's just me being overly sensitive about the graphics.

Maybe I'm not the only one curious, we'll see.
Anyways, great video as always!"
1,Narrator i didn't know you were a duck
2,I love this channel!
1,I love the Kurzgesagt vids  but I couldn't watch this one till the end
1,aka the legacy media and establishment politicians

1,"I generally can't handle a lot of medical information, triggers some moderate discomfort. Normally Kurzgesagt videos makes it easier for me to handle and understand, which is great. This one however, I had to keep stopping it and resuming on different days >_>;  Maybe one day I'll be able to come back to this one and watch it from beginning to end with no interruptions. I don't know if it's the subject matter or visuals. It feels like watching a horror movie where you are watching the killer and it's slowly killing people and the suspense is there and you know physically it cannot hurt you but your so invested ^^;"

0,New fear: Unlocked!
1,Woah. The quality on their videos has skyrocketed.
1,"A tiny micrometre sized single cell amoeba can take down a fully grown human being that has literally over a trillion cells to their name. That's either the most insane display of quality over quantity ever or poetic justice. Either way you guys already made me feel small and insignificant with showing me how large black holes can get. Did you really need to make me feel like a weakling as well? Amazing, love it!"
1,The jump in animation quality and sound design in this video alone is enough to fill me with excitement and awe

1,"I personally really don’t like the presentation on this one. The patient’s face seems like it’s a totally different art style from the whole Kurzgesagt channel, and the ad at the ends seems too juvenile. I like the honest, straightforward pitch telling me what’s available at the store- there’s no need to turn it into a skit."

1,"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.""   
 -John 
God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. 

We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him. 
We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins. 

He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven

Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends
Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.


May God Bless you all"

1,"My uncle died due to this parasite, the family didn't have the money, they were very poor at the time. My grandma was a shitty person (trash person same with my Grandpa) so she never bothered with Insurance because she didn't give a shit thus we couldn't save my uncle in time and all we could've done was to see him died at his deathbed, I still remember the day when he was suffering before he died, I was a child who wasn't emotional and confuse of course so I didn't cry, however, my mother and aunts were in pain. If you read this, please care about your family, never see them suffer to death."

1,Can we acknowledge the fact that kurzgesagt is getting greater every year with the animation?
1,Can it survive in a swimming pool with chlorin?

1,Recently I saw a story about a 11 yo boy in Florida that went on a family outing to a state park in the morning and swam in a lake. By bedtime he had a slight fever and headache and by morning he couldn't be awakened. The _only_ reason he survived was he was in a hospital 1 hour away from one of two locations in the US  that had a rare medication that may or may not kill the infection. He lived thanks to that medication and the correct diagnosis on the doctor's part however the damage to his brain was severe and may never recover fully. But like you said it is thankfully rare
1,For videos amazing as these ..the least u could do i like and comment...and obviously subscribe

1,"""Have to deal with it"""
2,Good god the animations.......it's so smooth
1,"The amoeba is simply something the body and its immune system never expects it’ll have to fight; think of how devastating it would be to leave a wolf overnight at a pet store full of bunnies lol. Or what it would be like to put an invasive creature in a habitat where it never expected a super predator. The human body is clearly not ready for an amoeba that thrives in heat, disables the immune response, and literally seeks the brain."

1,"Oh no worriesrolling_on_the_floor_laughing Because ⅔ of worlds human population are infected with a parasite typically found only in cats. The parasite is called Toxoplasma Gondii and it infects and controls the brain. Mice that were infected with the brain controlling parasite didn't fear cats any longer and were literally running to cats. And humans were showing personality and behavior changes depression, Parkinson's disease, and  other diseases. Let that sink in."

1,thanks for making me even more afraid of bodies of water
1,Amazing that so much has been learned about how this amoeba operates with less than 400 known cases!
1,Just today I heard in the news that a guy got this fker amoeba through his tap water (he washed his nose) and died. I'm worried now

They seem to love hunting bacteria, are generally good at staying under the immune system's notice, aren't really bothered by the compliment system, and in general are pretty good at chilling out in the human body. if we create a version of this that's not really attaracted to nerve cells (or maybe even attaracted to cancer) it could be a huge boon for medicine."

2,Lol the outro is cute
1,"Great video, but I have one addition. You can treat Naegleria Fowleri and subsequent Primary Amebic Meningioencephalitis (PAM) that follows when exposed. IV and/or Intrathecal administration of Amphotericin B, with the possible co-administration of Fluconazole and oral Rifampicin, has been shown to cure PAM if the infection is caught early. I am not trying to take away from this video. I just want to inform people that an infection by N. Fowleri isn’t necessarily a death sentence. Great content from Kurzgesagt, as usual!"

Also is it just me or is one of the first video were they use humans this much?"
1,"it bothers me that ""Kurz gezagt"" is pronounced incorrectly. And no I'm not german."
1,Kurzgesagt will never seise to amaze me with how captivating their videos are. I turn on a video and 10 minutes just disappears
1,"People fear a lot things, especially death, but a christian has only to fear one: God

We have nothing accomplished by ourselves, it is a gift from our creator, and he alone has the power to take and give life. 
Jesus is the way the truth and the life. Someone who believes in him, has to fear nothing. I am not believing in Jesus, out of tradition, nor out of personal fear about death. But because he changed my life, made miracles, and saved me from my egoistic selfcentric worldview, which was completely about how i can achieve something.
Jesus is also knocking at your heart, let him in, he will free you, if you want to be freed from your ruleship over your life, which is obviously as all humans are, miserably. 

Everything in this world has a beginning, and an end. And everything what has a beginning, must have some Beginner. He is called God, who came to us humans in form of Jesus Christ!

Have a nice day, a lovely virtual hug and great love towards the truth, from a brother of you in another place of this world. :)"

1,Kurzgesagt finally gave the existential dread they dispense with each video a voice.....
1,I'm poor. It's sad that an educational poster is nearly double the cost of a ugly dinosaur poster on your site. I suppose poor peoples' kids don't get a poster. At least the videos are free. Ty.

Look, I don't want to troll you, nevah! But I think that most of your videos are nowadays about cool topics which can trend.
I don't know, videos about cool science subjects are one of your trademarks, that's cool, but I think you are bringing it too far. Feels like the proportion of these videos is getting bigger? Maybe it's just me and I should shut up.
But also, the carbon capture technology in you last video. I don't know, I'm no expert, but it didn't felt like very scientifically tight. That technology depends on energy use and more energy means more carbon emissions.... ok, ok, not the place neither the video for this discussion.
Just that. Please take it as critizism, this is no doubt one of my favs science channels."

1,the second this dropped I assure you someone is perfecting the nose and ear plugs for water diving so we can return to normal and a little less scared state
1,"Yes, the narrator has a bird. They have stated that every bird in their videos has a person, so you’re expect the narrator to have a bird. Though I thought it was that black bird tbh"
1,Thanks jackasses. Never entering freshwater again.

1,"""you are immune against every disease""
Amoeba: I'm about to ruin this humans whole career"

1,"“you dont have to be too worried about this”
oh good, i can swim without any worries.
“youre much more likely to drown in a pool”
*oh*"
1,"What’s more terrifying, an ameba that literally eats your brain or the new closeup animated faces in this video!?"

It's funny that you actually think that existencial crysis makes us happy. Because it's true."
0,now i have a new phobia
1,"The other exception are other pathogens that tricks your immune system into eating them,
That what happens when your immune system is taken over by leishmaniasis, or the leishmania parasite.
The leishmania parasite targets your immune system first(mainly macrophages, but they are much more dangerous if they infect your dendritic immune cells).
Multiple leishmania parasites are often eaten by a single immune cell at a time, most will die in the immune cells to trick them into thinking they are defeated,
The surviving leishmania parasites transform into amastogotes(the forms that have shed their tail to multiply more effectively and quickly).
Overtime the immune cells become crowded and then the parasites burst out to invade more cells and the cycle repeats until they are sucked up by another vector.
They are only transmitted through vectors called sand flies that bite an infected animal and ingest the parasites during the process.
And the sand flies then spread the parasites to new hosts and the cycle repeats.
The presence of sand flies determines if you’re going to get leishmaniasis.
The most dangerous forms are viscera,the forms that invade many organs of your body(mainly the liver or the lungs).
Only non phagocytic immune cells can fight off the leishmania parasites.
And I(Ryan VD) hope that you can make a video about this deadly parasite."
2,Thank you for a new fear and also cute moth animations.
1,So *thats* where my brain cells went

1,I clicked the video because I wanted to know more about this brain-eating amoeba I've been hearing about - glad to know that infections for it are rare!
1,Im surprised they didnt find a way to inject climate change and other libtard talking points into the video.
1,"remember, always wear nose plugs in fresh water
or swimming in general really"
2,The dread cloud is like the one from Adventure Time!! Loved this video
2,I had this

0,No wonder stupidity exists
1,"Got a small drop of water up my nose today, swimming at a lake beach with very warm water that was recently closed due to e.coli. the water got far enough to make my nose sting a little but it was a very small amount and I immediately blew out as hard as I could. I still feel like I might be fucked tho cos my mom has told a story of how my grandfather who was a pathologist, identified this disease in autopsy of a young boy who was first diagnosed with meningitis after swimming in the great lakes. to remind me to blow my nose after swimming in a lake, not sure if that would help much tho."
1,Just went into a hot beach guess I’m dying folded_handsskull
1,I originally started using goggles with the nose pease from the start. Now I am going to show this video to every pool manager that tells me to take them off. Thanks lad. -Daniel

1,thanks i am never touching water again
1,It does have a treatment Amphotericen B and IV azoles work but you need to diagnose it very early
1,This and necrotizing fasciitis are truly horrifying. Both from other wise innocuous single celled organisms that if they infect you in just the right way have terrifying and often lethal or disfiguring consequences. Both whose symptoms usually only appear after it is too late.
1,"Now that I've watched this, I've convinced myself I have one."

1,You should make a video about Prions
2,Lmao the end sequence
1,"perfectly healthy people dying in a few days with symptoms like confusion and seizures before dropping dead would definitely influence preindustrial peoples ideas on evil spirits, and I Imagine would try to blame it on something or someone that's responsible."

1,Another reason why I will never touch the ocean again
1,Thanks for this nightmare fuel Kurzgesagt.
2,The music was on point haha
1,"I was swimming in brackish water the other day while it was hot outside. I did a flip into the water and a bunch of water got up my nose, it went far back that I could feel it in my mouth and it made me cough. I'm not sure if the water was brackish or not, but it looks exactly like water when you search up ""brackish water"". The water temperature was probably around 75-85 degrees. Should I be concerned about this? I know it's really rare, but I don't really wanna die."
1,This was a fun video to watch right before I go to sleep
1,"This was such a good video, I’m surprised at how you and your team can make such amazing videos that constantly improve in quality, animation, and entertainment. Keep up the good job!"
1,"Actually, they are even less threatning to us because in any lakes or rivers they are mostly in cist stage, so you have to swim in really hot water to get a chance to be infected"
0,Well.... Shit
1,i feel like i'm watching a sci fi movie. What a horrible way to go. my brain shivered at the thought of it in it.  I heard a kid died of it a few yrs ago. Imagine being a little kid and dead not even knowing what or why. wtf
2,Existential dreads voice is nice would love to see and hear him in more videos
1,"The music works so well with the animation! The synthesizers make you feel like you're looking at some mutated, alien abomination."
1,Did anyone else find the background music in this episode very distracting?
1,ooh i dont know why but i really dont like the more 3d shots in this one just feels wrong
1,So i was going to swim at a lake this friday watched this and now am worried
0," Why? Why? Why you gotta do that, man?! I won’t fucking swim…"
1,"I know it's a wierd question, but is there any way you could partner with displate to get some of your posters printed on metal? They are so awesome and I know displate do some great work. Could be something to look at."

Also me: mum. I'm not going to take a shower today."
2,"Best horror movie after ""thing"" . Glad to see it before go to sleep."
1,thank you kurzgesagt. i am now terrified of entering the water in hot climates
1,Now I can finally justify pinching my nose shut when diving into water. I'm protecting myself against brain eating amoeba ofcourse!
1,"Goddamn I hope all of your Visual Artist, Writers, Performers, Audio Engineers, and Producers are paid well! The production quality on this is insane. You guys really have evolved over the years and this is one of your best yet"
1,I don't think this video should have been made. It's a bit too much. My health anxiety just went from its usual 72/100 to 295/100.
1,"Dude, the animation and cinematography in this episode is soooo goood!!! Just goes to show that the channel as a whole is constantly improving in all fields"
0,Question?....how do you kill it????
2, OH NO HE'S TOO CUTE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH
0,Holy shit are you *trying* to give me an anxiety attack???
1,halfway through the video when it shows the amoeba killing you: *intense dubstep*
1,Watch some Karen see this video and never let their kids touch water again.
1,is it just me or do one of the immune cells look like amongus
1,Perhaps a treatment could be designed that utilizes the amoebas taste for acetylcholine by attaching an isotope or something damaging to the ameoba to the molecule is is attracted to.
1,What a fascinating video star-struck thank you for uploading check_mark_buttonhundred_pointsraised_hand_light_skin_tone

1,"""But theres also some unlucky people"" YEA WELL IM NOT TRYNA BE THE UNLUCKY PERSON BRO"
1,"you know, south american cultures were actually astoundingly advanced when it comes to cranial trepanation. Like, we see skulls from as far back as 400 bc showing signs of people having survived the procedure, and you even see them getting procedurally better at the technique through the centuries, climbing to something like a 90% survival rate (conservatively, as those who died before the bone could show signs of healing would not all have died -from-the procedure) by the end of the incan empire.

Now, you tell me this amoeba thrives in lakes and freshwater bodies in warm climates? and one of the first symptoms is a headache and nausea and that the primary cause of death is out of control brain swelling?

Sounds to me like exactly the kind of thing that pre-bacterial theory doctors in an insanely warm and humid climate on the same continent as the freaking amazon would give you skull holes over. and, without knowing exactly what caused the illness and sudden death, it could have become general preventative treatment for anyone suffering from severe flu-like symptoms within 3-4 days of having been out for a swim where water shot up the patient's nose.

the exact kind of consistent, scary, and sufficiently pervasive societal pressure to bring a people to develop and perfect incredibly elegant cranial surgeries over the course of some thousand odd years, methinks :)"
1,"This is easily the highest quality video the channels ever made, awesome animation! This has some awesome information in it!"
1,Very cool origin story of the monster from Carrion
1,tbh i love the posters i bought five of the muself but i wish there was one about how nuclear power plants or nuclear bombs work cus my cousin is amazed by that stuff
0,it sucks how bad we are at treating brain diseases

2,Great video. Sweet horrors from beyond my comprehension.
1,Why does this channel have both educational and fear mongering content.. grimacing_facesad_but_relieved_face
1,Their Animation is getting better than the software can handle.
1,Title of this video is a bit misleading... I only watched bc I thought you were going to tell me why it was overhyped. Now I'm terrified bc you basically just told us why it isn't overhyped.
1,Fun fact: The therapy for this parasite is steroids
1,"""The numner of karens are rising quickly"" , I wonder why? thinking_face"
1,"Kurzgesagt has thoroughly drained the well of existential crisis and they are now moving onto extreme and deliberate paranoia fuel-releasing a video about brain eating amoeba that dwell in pools and other bodies of water just a couple weeks before summer season
I’m not sure if I like this change
Edit:I have decided I like this change because the soundtrack from phase 3 onward is the perfect combo of epic and terrifying"
1,"F@ck war thunder

Grows mouths and heads?
It is perfect!"
1,That skit at the end was adorable <3
1, This is the single greatest graph Kurzgesagt has ever featured
1,What I got from this video is if I get water splashed into my nostrils I should drown myself.
1,Kurzgesagt casually finding more people with the smoothest voices ever
1,I didn't realize it actually mutated that way. Isn't that funny. It's kind of like how cholera or strep can change severity seemingly out of nowhere and turn into killers.

1,Wonderfully explained!
1,"Naegleria fowleri: you can’t defeat me

Immune system: We know but he can

Bacteriophages: OH HELLO THERE"
1,"Pretty sure they are not even in the northern hemisphere

Edit: I knew it, it doesn’t even live in most places"
1,"from the cdc: The risk of Naegleria fowleri infection is very low. There have been 33 reported infections in the U.S. in the ten years from 2011 to 2020, despite millions of recreational water exposures each year. By comparison, in the ten years from 2001 to 2010, there were more than 34,000 drowning deaths in the U.S.  (and yes I know these numbers apply to the US only)"
1,sounds like the only way it can get into your brain is if a lot of your natural defenses are already extremely weak to begin with.
1,"This featured in a major plot arc of House, M.D. when one of the doctors contracted nigleria while investigating the source of the amoeba. Turns out it came from the rainwater tank being used to water a cannabis grow. Really a terrifying illness (and obscure enough for a mystery)."

Learning also helps. Its fun learning how vast the universe is and, sometimes, how RARE Intelligent life like us Humans are. Or even how a tiny little bacteria can cause deaths 97% of the time its inside you, even tho its not a parasite or virus."
1,Was this made for John Green?
1,As soon as I saw the thumbnail I knew exactly what this was going to be about.

1,Is there a heart eating amoeba
1,Brain is overrated. You don't really need it if you're frequent social media.
1,Nice now I’m having a mini heart attack every time I drink water
1,"I studied this particular amoeba a while back, as explained in the video and also in my class, the most terrifying thing about this microorganism is the difficulty in diagnosis. 

1st, during its earliest infection, the patient is asymptomatic

2nd its symptoms are almost similar to other causes of meningitis. The only clue that you will be able to rule out that it is a Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is through a patient interview if he/she recently swam in a body of water which by that time, the patient is already unconscious or unresponsive. 

One of the ways that can help in its early diagnosis is when the patient will be able to tell that he/she swam previously during consultation before the disease even progresses. To be honest, no patient does because who would have known its relevance?"
1,The music in this video is amazing! Top notch stuff Kursgesagt!
2,Well... That was so scary
2,why not?
1,The animation quality in this episode is amazing! Keep up the good work!! :)

1,the most scary part in our body is the fact that the only reason why food goes down and not into the lungs is a flap that goes left or right depending if you need air or you want to swallow some food and if you suddenly have to cough after eating something guess what it means that the food tried to enter toward your lungs
1,U guys calling it horrible when its just doomg what it needs to
1,I went swimming recently in Atlanta and its been about a week since ive been there now and all of a sudden i got really bad nausea and vomiting. I was barely able to go to sleep that night and when i woke up i woke up with a fever of 102. My body feels so weak and im scared that it may be the amoeba talked about in this video. My parents wont take me seriously when i tell them my frustrations and i dont know what to do anymore. I read online that there is a way to test for it but i cant see that happening with my parents. Please someone tell me what i should do
1,"Thank you for making me afraid of water, I guess showering is dangerous for me."
1,thank you for giving me sleepless night
2,thank god i know i dont have it because im not dead yet
1,"The only way I can think of to do more research into this would be to do direct observation. As in, microscopes.

Though, the fact that it thrives in hot conditions does give me an idea for a potential assistance treatment: Cooling down the patient by using anti-fever medications, and preventing swelling by using anti-inflammatory medications. Yes, it'll make them vulnerable to other diseases for a time, but better for one to be vulnerable than for one to die."
1,Just in time to watch kurzgesagt.

2,I like how i was swimming for nearly an entire week and then this video pops up. Wish me luck guys grinning_face_with_sweat
2,"Overcoming existential dread? Like a person who laughs while being stabbed. Like a patient who watches as the doctor sticks them. Like a person who finds near death experiences challenges worth overcoming. Unusual, but not unheard of. lol"

1,"You’re little existential dread guy taught me something.
Dumb person : Everything is fine :D

Smart person : EVERYTHING IS POINTLESS ;-;

Galaxy brain : Existential dread is pointless :D

Take away; intelligence is the only thing where balance or being “in the middle” is bad. Being dumb equals ignorant bliss. Gaining an understanding makes you fear what you don’t. And being too damn smart means you have nothing to fear or question."

1,"To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message 

Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ? 

the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all
Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved 

Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity 

 God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins 

God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved 

the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins 

receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today 

John 3 
For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.

Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him]. 

This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned

. But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].””
‭‭John‬ ‭, 18-21‬ ‭

For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.”
‭‭Romans 6.23

2 Peter3

 9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins"

1,"Been trying to advise people about that for about three years. This is waterborne and politicians won't deal with the appropriated treatment. They pretty much toss some chemicals there and some parasites are probably immune or too microscopical to be noticed/killed. I guess Chester and others that jumped, were right. There's little hope because the struggle of Planet Dollar is to accumulate capital at all costs (body doomed and why not the soul as well?). I serve the Creator but I acknowledged Samael, the parasitic evil there. 

Doctors sabotaging humans... 

If things are bad in the organic... You can imagine how worse they'll be after this passage on Earth."

1,Apparently some scientists experimented with anti seizure treatment and something to do with silver but anyway whatever stuff  is in anti seizure drugs is able to pass into the brain and anti amoeba drugs find it difficult to enter so they combined them and the anti amoeba drugs could piggyback on them and they were able to reach the most effective position. What doctors normally do is inject them into the spinal cord which isn’t as good. This is what I heard but take it with a pinch of salt
1,My friends father just died from this. A few days ago my friends father died shortly after swimming in lake LBJ in Texas. It was originally diagnosed as meningitis until the doctors got the full detail.

1,"A wonderful video as always, but there is one thing about the animation in this one which I think could be made better. The close shots of the human (like at , for example) look a bit strange to me, compared to the usual style. I think it may be from the greater amount of detail in the mouth and nose, and I think it clashes with the style typically used for human figures by the animators. I'm not an animator or anyone knowledgeable about character design though, so it may be something else."

Meanwhile, naglaria has, though only in specific incidents, so it seems to be very rare to be in pipes, and there's never been a recorded case of infection from municipal water.  Still, this is why it's advised to use a netti pot with distilled water"

“AHHHHHH-"
1,"One thing that doesn't get mentioned enough about Naegleria fowleri is it is a thermophile an extremophile which loves hot water conditions or weak chemical pollution as they remove its competition which are more competitive over food resources (bacteria) than it is.  In fact it is actually the treatment of water, so long as the water isn't heavily chlorinated enough to exceed its relatively high tolerance, that allows them to thrive in pools, hot water heaters etc.

The increasing prevalence of these microbes is also a factor for concern as this increased prevalence are a side effect of what we are doing to our environment with toxic industrial pharmaceutical and other varieties of chemical pollution and the increased warming brought by greenhouse gasses. The more we ruin our environment the more at home it will be  as it depends on the lack of competition to thrive this in turn means it will be in the position to doom an unlucky few to death by amoeba."

1,"whenever there is good news about this, or a cure is found please make a video. Also, thanks for the paranoia.  What do you mean by water going far up the nose like snorting the water? Is it fine to swim under water because if you don't breathe in the water shouldn't be able to travel all the way into your sinuses because of the air lock accruing in your nose, right?"
1,At least it's not the birds suffering...

1,I felt bad for it at first since it was in someplace it didn't wanna be in then it got to the brain
1,Bro dead serious im not entering a pool again
1,Upon watching most of the great Kurzgesagt videos. I started to see deseases as an army of invaders rather than something that exist as a way to harm humans... its as if i'm a spaceship with an organized systematic army and there are distinct variety of soldiers inside operating while aliens are trying to take over or destroy it.

0,how to hate and fier water even more
2,Great. I’m never touching water again
1,"Kurzgesagt, this may be buried, but may I suggest a topic for possible video? I've recently heard about the abnormally high death rate of bees. I have not much idea about the effects this may have, but I believe something we can all agree on is that bees play a vital role in our ecosystem. Perhaps a video shining light on the potential threats bees are currently facing, the effects that this may have in the world and what we can do to help save the bees can help play a part in informing viewers about this topic and help save the lives of bees? Thank you very much for reading."
1,Oh i just opened youtube thinking of kursgezacht and its here

1,Good thing it was gone for a while skull
1,I mean phages
1,What an epic way to start my day
1,So brain-eating amoebae are not evil monsters. They're bacterium hunters who naively cause a catastrophe.
1,Im pretty sure i have thalassophobia so yeah i aint swiming in the beach or the pool anymore thanks to this video i watched
1,The Editors really went nuts on this one
1,"If I recall correctly, nagleriosis has a near 100% death rate regardless of treatment.
Scary stuff."
1,Thanks! I think you should add an early access feature to raise money

2,Dread is the best character ever
1,My ocd will never let me swim in a lake again
2,"Love how your videos have increased in quality, complexity and research.  One of the best channels on Youtube!"
1,"In 2012, I almost died from a drug overdose but Jesus Christ saved my life.  During this near death experience, I cried out to the Lord Jesus in prayer and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.  Please repent to the Lord Jesus for your sins and then get fully submerged under water as a baptism to God in the name of Jesus and obey what He wants you to do with your life or if you don't do this then when you die you will go to hell."
1,not gonna lie this was a better horror movie than Morbius
1,Could you please make similar video on Rabies?
1,"i live up in the pacific northwest near the canadian border and on friday, i was diving down in the lake and got some water in my nose and now im paranoid- before that my mom said ""they come in threes"" (in our culture, if someones dies, two more go with them) and then she told me about the brain eating amoeba hahaha.. that and yesterday i was wearing a snorkle as extra protection and its as if the lake hated me and made the water also shoot inside my goggles and slightly up my nose.... i think im too paranoid but i dont want to jinx myself. i probably got a sore neck from my flat pillow sldfjlsfdj also i think i have a headache? idk, i don't have a fever or havent been vomiting or had any lose stool, but i might force my mom to take me to the hospital and get checked and put on miltefosine just in case. btw the lake was cold but who knows, it was like 90 degrees yesterday and i think i was imagining the lake warm.."

Hey Kurzgesagt, when did your animation jump to the next level? It is extra excellent today."
1,"I cant believe they made existential dread, something mostly apparent in this channel, became a character."
1,"Fucking hell man!!! 
What a wonderful world this is.

Humbling experience that one tiny amoeba can do such a damage.

I think the Hindus on the other side of the world got it right, which says that at the end of the world people will die of very small living things and their disease"

You guys and Tierzoo are literally the two best science channels on YouTube. Thanks for educating me!"

2,Is it just me or is the animation better than before
1,"One of my friends in middle school died from this, it was incredibly sad. She went swimming in a lake during the summer and got infected that way. They didn’t discover it before it was too late. As a warning to those living in the south, don’t go underwater while swimming in a lake in the south during the summer. Stay safe"

1,What a beautiful animation of a person!!! Y’all outdid yourself
1,"I'd just like to point out that this has got to be one of if not the most beautifully animated video on this channel yet. It has been amazing to see the art style of Kurzgesagt mature and refine over the years, and I hope the animators are proud of the progress they've made, starting with circles with up to 4 colors all those years ago with the first immune system video and evolving into a brilliant ballet of dynamic cells interacting and bending as they move around and do things. I absolutely love that this team has been able to keep going after all this time and expand to cover a wide array of complex topics while also keeping things simple, fun, and enjoyable. I look forward to every upload and love the beautiful products that bring great information and a wonderful art style to more places than just the once per month upload. Thank you for all that you do, everyone over at the team."

1,"Amoeba survivor here! I had it when I was child living in Central America. I was about 6 or 7 so I don’t remember much, but I do remember feeling like my energy was being drained from me. It’s kind of hard to explain, but I can still remember the feeling."

1,"I feel like eliminating that species, maybe we can do that by producing some of them with a dominant gene that makes them not attracted to human nerves..."
1,“give us your money and youll not experience existential dread”
1,"I have three things to say:
1. Your animation has gotten so much better! This episode just looks GORGEOUS
2. You've effectively scared me away from lakes and seas and the sort for a long, long time
3. The last bit about the existential dread is so good, if I had any money I'd be shopping on your website right now!

I love this channel so much"
1,I believe these kids died from it playing in their slipping slide…

There's a lot of horrifying things that a person can experience, and honestly, watching this video gave me a new fear."

1,We found the cause of liberalism at last.
1,For some reason I thought that someday there eould be a TikTok challange of getting infected by it...
1,"That reminds me of a late notice I got last year that our regular water was found ""lightly"" contaminated by this brain  eating amoeba due to rain floods. The notice was delivered several days late and it certainly induced a panic for awhile. We were advised not to shower and if we must to avoid contact to the eyes and nose at all costs."
1,"huh, didn't make me feel like it was particularly overhyped"
1,"your videos cause us an existential crisis, then you get rid of it from your posters"
1,Now I have even more reason to not like swimming in lakes..... also I wonder if that could be used as a bio weapon.....
1,I will never use water again
2,Man it looks like that amoeba was having so much fun!
1,"After it was over: Also the voice over is the ship's voiceover in ""In Space with Markiplier"". I kept shouting Kurzgesagt anytime I heard it.

I thought this was called the most overhyped parasite, but I must have misread it, It's the most horrible parasite. Weird. Also 6 and half minutes in, good title choice, if you ever thought the jaws movie was ""people may fear ever going back in the water again"". well this video is crazy. All of your videos except a few are just this insane. I had your last 3 years of calendars, I didn't get one this year because money was tight."
1,i completely drool just by watching these animations. So much improvement throughout the years!

1," This voice actor needs to make a return and be the one who voices the existential dread videos such as ""what if we nuke a city"" ""what happens if the moon crashes into earth"" ""The dark forest"" ""Climate doom"" etc.
He can basically be the voice actor when anything scary and/or evil is talked about while Steve Taylor is the voice of good and hope."
1,"Kurzgesagt, thank you for talking the time to have better quality animation. I understand how time consuming it can be. But its starting to enter the uncanny valley, its getting too good"
1,beautiful posters i bought some
1,"Oh no, they gave him a Birdsona and it's too powerful, and can't be stopped."

1,"So, I shouldn't continue making fun of those people who hold their nose closed when jumping in a lake?"
0,"Basically bombing an entire forest to kill everything in it



*Vietnam flashback*"
1,"So basically it's another one of those causes of deaths that is horrifying because we have no choice about it (other than plugging our noses), and so it's less deadly, but also scarier, as opposed to something like heart failure, which causes the most widespread death, but is not seen as a threat because we can actually do something about it (namely eating well and exercising)"

1,"I really appreciate this channel spreading awareness. My family had to go through the ordeal of losing an 11 y/o girl from this. Contracted in the Brazos river in Texas.

1,Canceling my ymca subscription
1,"the chances are miniscule so it hasn't become a dread, but never the less I'm never swimming in open water again. :))"
1,I already know this one.
1,I'm no microbiologist but could anyone maybe invent maybe a spray before you swim underwater that can hide acetycholine for days  to prevent the amoeba from entering your brain? Or maybe a trigger for the strongest immune fighters to take on the amoeba and guide them to the nose if they were to enter there before they reach the brain? It would seem like we could fight this disease no problem and if we could find a way to fight it off without it finding its way to the brain this problem could be solved. Nose clips that stop water from entering your nose seem to be the most preventable way to contract the amoeba so far.

1,"Quick fact to be added , virus and bacteria that kill their host tend to be replaced by a less aggressive evolution since by killing the host they also kill their food source and can't spread out , you can see this by looking at the latter versions of Covid that reproduced faster but were less harmful to humans."
1,This sounds somewhat like cordyceps and I have been really interested in the videos as well as the fungal disease that essentially makes you a zombie. Cordyceps is quite fascinating and I think a video on it would be rlly cool and I would enjoy it very much

2,Leave it to this channel to ruin your summer bathing with gusto and great animation xD
1,"Love the video, long time supporter of the channel. As a sinus rinse user as part of my sinus regimen (surgery, allergy shots, cleaning) I'm all to well familiar of the dangers. Distiller water is only what comes in contact with my nose.
Something to note, the number of deaths reported from this bacteria is really an unknown number. Yes, the CDC mentioned the dates going back to 1937 from autopsy records. It is hard to state an exact number (much like any other cause of death), but it is still very rare indeed.

Thanks again for the video."
1,"I read once a story of someone who did lasik (or however its written) and didn't wait for the period for his eyes to heal and went swimming in warm lake water, this bacteria got to him from his eyes and ate his eyes, I don't remember if he died or not though"

1,Also I gotta say I'm in love with your art.
1,In a way you can look at the earth as a cell that either spreads or dies in a cold unknown universe. Best way to survive is to spread life to other planets and push the beauty and horror of life to more places.

1,I'm a minor authority on this amoeba. There have been around 1000 documented cases in all of human history. We may or may not have an effective treatment for it (Mifesterone) but there have been so few cases that it's not clear if the drug helped the patient or they were somehow naturally immune to it.

I've seen it with my own eyes. Some of my childhood friends, neighbours, etc die of it. Heck I've even attend some of their burial, visit them in the sick bed, or at the hospital.

Do I afraid of Dengue Fever?

Yes, but actually no. The last person I know die from dengue fever is like fifteen years ago.

My country health care service is getting better everyday. As long as you can reach medical facilities in time, you'll be save.

Just make sure that none of your family members is a witch doctors nor spirit shaman. Who often think themself is waaay smarter than a legit doctors and paramedics worker."
1,"I realise how absolutely astonishing it actually is that as a kid i swam in warm water ponds here in florida that were so gross, that when you were done your skin would literally be green with algae, and yet all i got for 15+ years of doing that was a single ear infection."

1,"An amoeba (/əˈmiːbə/; less commonly spelled ameba or amœba; plural am(o)ebas or am(o)ebae /əˈmiːbi/), often called an amoeboid, is a type of cell or unicellular organism which has the ability to alter its shape, primarily by extending and retracting pseudopods. Amoebae do not form a single taxonomic group; instead, they are found in every major lineage of eukaryotic organisms. Amoeboid cells occur not only among the protozoa, but also in fungi, algae, and animals."

He develops so much excruciating pain that opiates stop having any effect, so they put him in an induced coma - but it gets worse...

1,"And the only amoeba that is much more deadly than the brain eating amoeba is entameoba hystolitica, a truly deadly parasite, and this amoeba is known for causing dysentery,
But this amoeba  doesn’t just attack the digestive system, it can also attack the nervous system, and any other systems where the blood vessels take this parasitic amoeba to,
And I say this amoeba is deadly I really mean deadly, and this parasite can kill over 100 thousand people a year,
And I got these facts from the monsters inside me clip about this parasitic amoeba.
And also this parasite can reproduce super fast, a single dysentery amoeba can produce up to 35 million descendants in a day, and this make E, Hystolitica(and it’s relatives) reproduce much faster than all eukaryote organisms Combined(and possibly including bacteria), and that thousands of individuals produced per second.
And this insanely impossibly fast reproduction can make this amoeba very concerning and invasive.
And this amoeba is probably native from Africa, and this protozoan is primarily tropical."
1,this video wish that kurzgesagt would make a game
2,"I like more the simple humans... But, ok. Fine"
1,I love how naegleria fowlerii is the cause of a horrifying deadly disease but this video still shows it as just a little guy. just hungry little fella

1,Now I'm afraid of touching water ever again.
1,Your animation quality has really improved
1,"When it showed the eye animations for confusion, fatigue, and seizures, it reminded me of the one drawing meme/trend with the Jack Stauber song Control. (The one that’s like “love, brain, heart, control, caffeinate! melatonin” )"

1,"Very interesting video, but i wish you would have made it a little bit less horrific! I hope my daughter of ten years old never sees this one as she would undoubtedly get nightmares and ptss-like fear attacks!

With that amount I can buy an entire book on that particular topic and still have some money to spare. grinning_face_with_sweat If you could lower the prices, i am certain that many people will buy them making it cancel off the loss by lowering the current price and the more people will buy your products, the more people can know about your channel and beautiful products.

1,"What a creepy amoeba. Also, O<O where Dread has an amazing voice"
1,"person walking to a pond being monitored by scientists: Hey what's happening here? I'm going to swim here

scientist monitoring the pond: stay away, this pond is infested with brain eating amoebea.

person: that's clearly a lie, brain-eaters are only a thing from the zombie films, and what is an ""amoeoeboeaea""? Until when scientists like you keep analyzing and searching ""the truth"" while telling the masses things like the earth is round, the moon is real, and the world is not controlled by lizard-people? Are you going to limit my freedom of swimming in this pond to refresh myself in this hot sunny day?

scientist:Nvm u can come in, swim as freely and as long as you want."

0,I heard about a kid who was 5 who died from this when I was 5. Scared me.
1,cool. finally an excuse to stay at home in summer times
1,I found out about Naegleria Fowleri through a documentary when I was 10 and it absolutely terrified me. It still does.
1,Would it be a good idea to medically chill the patient if they are infected by this? Would it slow down the way the ameba functions?
1, what the heck is that among us
1,im not a huge fan of the extra shiny visuals of the human but i support whatever Kurzgesagt thinks is the right move <3
1,"The ending of this video was worth the terror I felt through most of it. Haha

Also, don't do an image search for naeglaria fowleri. You'll find an image with those weird mouth openings that make it look possessed by the devil himself."
1,I got so scared while watching this when i finish i will immediately go wash hands with soap
1,my takeaway: plural of amoeba is amoebe
2,"This ending put a huge smile on my face, soo cute."

2,I love that kurzgesagt is free but I would pay to watch these.
1, finally i can become big brain xd
1,"Guys, don't let this video scare you. Even the end of the video says how unbelievably rare it is that you'll get attacked by this parasite, you need not be afraid, you can still swim and stuff. Interestingly enough the original title of this video was ""The Most Overhyped Monster on Earth"" which is weird since this current title is basically the complete opposite of that."
1,i don't think you know what existential dread is lmao

1,"First time I’ve seen a proper personification of everyone’s favourite science narrator, along with the first time I’ve heard any voice different"

1,"This is why you don’t give crack to amoeba, they were such a good amoeba, killing bacteria like they should. Then after just one round they go crazy, get extra mouths, and then they eat your brain"
1,"Can you please make a long poster about the journey into space? Similar to the underwater one which is one of my favorites, but go in the opposite direction. So instead of deeper, go into space and show the various layers of the atmosphere."
1,Thank you Kurzegesagt team! I now have additional phobia's :D

1,"This is the amoeba that is found at the Arizona Hot Springs, which is a popular hiking spot in AZ. So anyone who is going there, please be careful and don't put your head in the water! I have been there a few months ago and there are signs about this and people also tell you, but I totally didn't realize how dangerous is it. Luckily the water is pretty hot so I don't think anyone wants to put their head in it by default."
1,Aaaand… we get a jump scare from the K crew… cool.
2,Thank God I never learnt to swim
0,"That's okay, I didn't want to cool off anyways."
1,time for more lockdowns and mandates
1,is this the first kurzgesagt human?
1,"This is one of my fears because when I was a kid, there was one celebrity in my country who had a car accident and ended up in a river or something. The cause of their death is something similar to this. (I can't remember is it is this amoeba exactly or what, but it's something going in their brain.)  But from then on, I am scared the shit out of fresh water."
1,Good vid and it's probably a great atmosphere for it because are body has 75% I think water in the brain area
1,"So, these things are just like children
They go into places they're not supposed to, follow everything they want, eat all of your things, and can take way too many hits.

1,"This comes out of nowhere ,but when people say how life seems pointless and they would wanna suicide. 

I do give them their emotional space and validate what they sre going through but in the end i really want them to realize, how amazing it is to be just born as human.

1,"Besides Naegleria Fowleri there is also another amoeba that can attack the brain and do similar damage. The amoeba Entamoeba histolytica usually attacks the intestine but they can migrate to other organs. When it migrates to the brain, it can cause symptoms similar to Naegleria's PAM (Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis) which is why the invasion of Entamoeba histolytica in the brain is called SAM (Secondary Amebic Meningocephalitis). Take this info with a grain of salt because I am just remembering what I read in my Parasitology class back in the day.

Also, I vaguely remember but I think SAM is more common than PAM but can be treated easily.

Its cool to see videos of stuff I learned back in college animated like this red_heart"

1,The BEST plug ever and why do I feel like this is the first time I've ever seen a person in Kurzgesagt video omg
1,Amber heard?
1,is it just me or is the production quality of this video EXTRA good? the music and the art are so pleasing to watch and listen to
0,All these people saying how their relatives died from this make me genuinely panic
1,This guy is just fear mongering now for click-bait. Might as well be a Kolkata scammer stealing retirement funds.
1,you can't scare me like this brooo loudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_face
1,"""Guys itsnt that I am afraid of swimming its just that I dont want my brain eaten"""
1,I like watching your videos they remind me of the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
1,"Awesome adventures, can't get enough! I really enjoyed watching and coming back again for more. folded_hands"
1,Kurzgesagt has improved SO much in their videos
1,"Now I have a legit reason to not go out in the summer, thanks kurzy"
1,Animation SOMEHOW improved again ?!
1,"Trully incredible how far this channel has come over all these years. Thought it couldn't get any better yet it constantly persists to. The animation is astonishing, the storytelling enticing and I love how in each video so much effort is put into presenting topics as scientifically accurate as possible and sharing all research info in 'Sources & further reading'. This is in my opinion the ideal of conveying popular science."
1,"It seemed like at the start of every school year someone was in the hospital with an ""amoeba."" That doesn't go with the given statistic. Is the species in this video the only brain eater in the US south? Or were doctor just using the word ""amoeba"" in a slangy sort of way?"
1,"The imune sistem:we will defeat it!

1,Had some water splashed up my nose at a hot spring and couldn't stop thinking about this video

2,"Man kurzgesagt is one of my fav channels, great animation, great info, great work ethic. Keep it up grinning_face_with_big_eyes"
1, That cell is SuSpiciously familiar.
1,"I know this is horrifying, but part of me wishes I could grow a dozen mouths when I hit a buffet."
1,The soundtrack in this video was UNREAL
1,ok this sounds kinda dumb but does your brain work like muscles where if your loses some of your brain cells and then regenerates them do you regenerate more or less or the same that you had
1,"Christ, the animation quality of this episode is sooo good, it has really improved since it began but the style is still their and distinct! Its truly amazing"

1,Could you get it in the shower?
1,"Ah sweet, natural horrors beyond my comprehension"
1,Please do a video on food crisis!
1,"Thank you Kurzgesagt for another amazing video, now I am scared of Amoebas."
1,I wish I didn’t see this before going on vacation at water parks and pools.
1,"Known about this since I was little, and I used to live by and go on Lake Wylie all the time (not the cleanest lake, to say the least) and I was always terrified to swim/jump in"

1,I thought we only needed to worry about zombies eating our brains.
1,Man is an op Isekai Protagonist. Gets transferred to another world and nothing can stop him.
1,wow this is very scary to think that you can die in a week for most of that you dont even know what is happening but the end at  wow that is the strangest way to addvatise posters.
1,how has this man not got 20 mil
1,is it just me or are the people's faces a little different. More detail. I kind of liked it the old way.
1,Wonder how many people swore off swimming in the first half of this video and didn't finish.
1,"Hey guys, can you please upload your videos in 4K, I used to watch your channel on my 4K TV, it will vastly improve the experience"
1,I didn’t know amoebas could infect but they can
1,When a channel have more subs than the entire population of my country... So amazing!!!
2,Damn nature you scary lol
1,I am surprised that even 3% of infected can survive this. What consequence does it leave?
1,Wait so you guys mean a literal parasite? I thought you were going to talk about Corporate America. But after your last video I guess you had to find a new topic to keep that dirty funding going.
1,watching this while eating is a very effective weight loss technique... great video though!
1,this looks like a good plot for a  war based movie....face_with_tears_of_joy
1,"what about cytotoxic t-cells and NK cells, can they kill the amoeba?"
1,"The animation now really came a long way...

They have blurs and glows now too... 

And they're consistent in their contents...

Kudos to Kurzgesagt Team for their wonderful work"

1,my favourite part is the end
2,"Well I'm terrified to go swimming now, nice!"
1,I don't have the brain cells to keep them alive
1,All league of legends players has 100% chance to survive from this amoeba
1,"“Ok, here is an amoeba, an incredibly small life form, that exists in water which is quite abundant on earth, that can infiltrate your nose, dismisses innate defences, casually feeds on neurotransmitters which are your nervous system’s telephone cables, waltzes through your armies of foot soldiers and tanks, laughs at kamikaze attacks by neutrophils, is simply tickled by your compliment system/antibodies which are the ATGMs of your immune system all to casually feed on your brain because it’s yum.”

“Oh but don’t worry it’s super rare and probably won’t happen to you”
Me: *Already in the foetal position with heart beating like I’ve overdosed on meth*"
1,"I read it as ""Most Horrible Paradise : Brain Eating Amoeba"" and was confused briefly"
1,"So if this amoeba decides to conquer the world by killing all the humans, the only person who will be alive is our president. Since he has no brain."
1,Ok but can we talk about how amazing the dirpy background music is?
1,Echinococcus be like : --------------------
1,These vs batceriophages
1,"Only time I hear about it in my states news (Texas) it’s at one of the beaches, so I guess oceans as well, but it is also the Gulf of Mexico, and if I looked into the actual reports maybe it was by a river or something"
1,The animation in this video is Fantastic.
1,"Ight, if i wanna swim its in a tub full of pudding. What? You gonna stop me?"
1,Quick advice: don't fill your neti pot with tap water if you want to avoid this. But you shouldn't be doing that anyway.
1,"wow, a bio horror story. so close the nose while jumping into freshwater ponds seems reasonable"
1,"43 seconds ago, never been this early"

1,Ok so how Web make it go extinct
1,*kurzgesagt is getting self aware on what we are thinking when watching their videos*
1,I like to think of the immune system as a military
1,Bro they made the humans look human
1,"Although I had already seen this video in the German channel, the last part wasn’t included. It was sooooo cuteeee. It’s been more than a year and a half, and this channel has never disappointed me. You’re doing a great job!!"
1,"Have they tried looking for a bacteriophage that counters Naegleria Fowleri? 

Earth is a big planet, we could look for one."
1,"I went to the ocean and maybe, this can be my last message, goodbye"
2,Well this sure was a fun one
1,"ngl, i am having nightmares tonight"
2,I love watching you guys it so fun an super needy information the give as thanks
1,With rising water temps I wouldn’t be so sure about it not being a major concern.
1,"Oh hey, who are you? It’s me your existential dread. I found that pretty funny."
1, amogus approaching
1,"Brain eating amoeba, sounds like a great video to watch while I eat"
1,"I love this animation style so much. The music also really reminds me of Terraria, captures that sense of this wierd and rare brain eater perfectly."
1,So I need to start telling people to snort lake water instead of just drinking now???
1,I’m never going in my hot tub ever again
1,this video gave me a headache loudly_crying_face
2,Great! Just as I was looking forward to the summer…
1,Yes a new video father all these weeks or months
1,"That's new, instead of having an existential crisis, I gained a new paranoia.
Kurzgesagt videos are always like that aren't they"
1,Brain hug for doing such amazing videos heart_suit
1,If they had us in the first half had a scientific version.
1,It’s only been four weeks. How on earth did your animations Ba come so good
1,Aaaand that's why i am having hydrophobia
1,Watching this is way more fun than being stuck in a science lesson cuz this channel actually makes us interested in what they are talking about
0,Time to PANIC!!!  or not
1,"Wasn't this named ""Most Overhyped something""?"
0,Too bad..i got  infected but it died of hunger
1,Its crazy how you where in the space in markiplier and nobody noticed even though i did your few acting voice in it was amazing keep it up man!

1,overhyped? doom slayer enters my brain through my nose and that's overhyped?
1,"Existential crises are for people that don't have day to day things to worry about.
That's why animals seem so chill."
2,The best video to watch before going to sleep
1,"I will never swim in a lake again. After watching a few more Kurzgesagt videos, I will never leave my house again."
1,"IDC what kurzgesagt said at the end of the amoeba part, I'm never stepping into a lake again..."
1,I live in Northwest Louisiana..... this periodically makes headlines in my area.
1,and people used to laugh at me for pinching my nose whenever I dove into pools... HAH!
2,A good analogy of this amoeba would be liberals gone progressive.
1,Gotta love the existential dread short at the end therebeaming_face_with_smiling_eyes
0,bro this fokin shit is making me scared to swim now
1,"So in simple terms, this thing is a living malware"
1,"Me When Video Was Released 
The 2nd Pins Out Saw No Pin
Ahhhhhhhhhhh"

1,"Oh my god! I was having lunch, couldn't even eat anymore! What a horror movie!"
1,when he showed the cases I was so relieved
2,"Wow, not a political video. What a treat."
1,the end card where Steve acts like a 5 year old full of wonder is hilarious
1,I think this explains why people hold their noses when diving
1,"Lovely! Speaking as a (retired) doctor I can confidently state... that I have never heard of this infection! 
That's the 'fun' thing about medicine; nobody can know everything about anything. The practicable upshot is that it's just as well rare diseases are rare because chances are if you get one by the time your doctor(s) have worked out what's going on you're probably screwed - if your doctor(s) can't possibly know everything the best they can do is be good at as much as they can, starting with the common stuff. An awful lot but not everything."
1,This animation is truly amazing

2,Wow the animations just got even better (and my fears of random stuff too)
1,"This is horrible for who it gets through to. Another informative, beautiful animated and narrated video! You guys are just the best!"
2,If I wasn't just scared before I'm horrified now. Thanks?
1,"Great, a deadly disease with mostly vague and common symptoms that kills you quickly and for which there is no effective cure, at the same time it’s also fairly easy to hold a somewhat plausible risk to contract it in “common” situations such as being in a pool or in a lake where you normally wouldn’t think you’d die afterwards. Eheh hypochondria goes brrrr"
1,Underrated soundtrack for this video really.
1,Imagine if the amoeba evolve and takes literally the control of the host’s brain. Scary
1,wish i watched this before i went swimming in a lake a couple days ago
1,"mmm yes, dont worry guys, i only have 1 braincell


















u know this is just a joke"
2,Can we get some love to the guy who voiced the existential dread? :0

2,respect to the animators and music creators. Great work :D
2,"Jojo's bizzare adventure
The lovers stand lol"
1,why is the music soo goofy
2,Loving the new style so well animated!
1,"This video is very different from other videos, the theme and music are new."

1,Capitalism is so ugly it even tries to monetize existencial dread.
0,"well, another way to die i guess."
1,"That ""Existential Dread"" thing is the ghost of H.P. Lovecraft."
1,"I like how this video was titled to ease my fears, but did the complete opposite. I feel there should be a caveat to the reported cases... there are probably wayyyyyyy more missed diagnosed cases since it has such a short killchain and is difficult to discover even as its happening."
2,This was cool asf

2,"Also, the video was great!"
1,summertime will never be the same from now on
1,why why did you talk about this I am  going to have nightmares
1,I think we are very weak against this bacteria because we encountered it very few times and there wasn’t a need to evolve against it since there are other pathogens that would be better to evolve better defenses.
1,Chad Kurzgesagt comes back with another banger in animating and content
1,"Met a few of them once, messy eaters. Though, it was admittedly their messy eating that caused a few human nuerons to get lodged in me and some other Paulinella Chromatophores. I suppose I should thank them, being concious is... good i guess, but I still can't spell my own username!


/j
Okay, what's the cringe score of my comment? I'm going for the high score."
1,the thing that's more scary than the amoeba is the music of the video
1,Would excessive nutritrafills be effective?
1,call my girl naegleria fowleri cuz she eat me up and gimme dumb brain
1,is there brain eater in toilet thinking_face
1,"Thanks, I will no longer swim in the ocean thumbs_up"
1,WOAH! the animation in this one is incredible!
2,My visual euphoria is been satisfied againgrinning_squinting_face
1,"I use a netty pot and nasal salts for sinus relief and must always use boiled water at room temperature so the heat kills the amoeba in case it travels up the nose and into the brain. Bought bottled water in Bangkok and they had little white wiggles in it, stuck to drinking soda and soft drinks for the rest of the trip."
1,I like the fun ending. Some would call it shameless self advertisement. Kurzesagt is becoming less science and more funny grinning_squinting_face the ending was amazing
2,"Great, another thing to worry about........"
1,"I should not have clicked on this because I am well aware of this amoeba and it absolutely terrifies, horrifies, and causes me to panic and have mass amounts of anxiety any time any amount of water gets in my nose, whether it's from drinking water or from something else."
1,those are pretty posters ngl

2,"Absolutely loved the animation on this video. I love all of the animations, but it feels like in this video it got even better and I didn't think that was possible."
1,Why did I watch this before bedtime.
1,"Our immune system is such an epic battle holy shit.
We could make whole TV series about its adventures ala Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones.
And it's so colorful at least according to your animations.

On that note, I highly recommend ""SNKRX"" which is essentially a little indie game about that.... just the smallest, simplest arcade-strategy game tbh but thought I'd give them some credit for the theme.  We still need a movie / tv show of some kind though lol."
1,a student accidentally inhaled water from a swimming pool. this is what happened to his brain.
2,Whats up with the animation on this video its great
1,This sounds horrifying.
1,I’m touching grass now
1,I think I first learnt of these things in a monsters inside us episode years ago. Never forgot it cause it creeped me out so much. Stayed away from smaller ponds for a long time.
0,"Dangerous brain eating ameba: **starts eating and killing everything in its path**

Neutrophils: Guess I’ll just die"
1,"This does beg a question in my mind. We know humans can only get it when water with the amoeba in it gets pushed pretty far up the nose. However, we're not the only mammals that swim. Are there instances of other animals getting these infections? I'm genuinely curious."
1,"Hello Kurzegasgatat, would you anticipate contact with/infection by this amoeba will increase with climate change, through global warming? Increased temperatures meaning more hospitable environments for them/more contact with humans (humans using/swimming in water more often due to it being hot hot hot!)"
1,"So, immunocompromised people like me, would stand no chance?"
2,I never knew dying could be so cool
1,"Very minor thing, but the way the nasal mucosa was described as ""a slime"" makes it seem like its some kind of extracorporeal layer of mucous. The mucosa of any mucosal surface on the body (eg. the intestines or mouth) is composed of human cells rather than a substance produced by them."
1,I just went swimming in our pool.

2,what an adorable and cute ending for adults!
1,Why did I watch this video....

1,"I'm looking in the newest comments and a lot of it is just people saying stuff like ""should I be scared of water"" or ""thanks for making me terrified"". They literally explained how the chances of getting this are extremely slim. There have only been 381 cases since 1937. That is about 4 cases per year. If you ignore all other factors and only look at these statistics, you have a 5.08x10^-10 % chance of getting it per year. Or a 5.08x10^-8 % chance of getting it in 100 years. THERE IS NOTHING TO FEAR. I can't even put into words how astronomically small that number is. You will be fine."
1,"As they say, the chances of it happening are small but never zero."
1,Just remember when u go swimming you swimming in millions of zombies lol

1,"Thanks, now I’m terrified of going swimming in lakes now…"

1,is there a chemical that can poison  them....or like some sort of acetocolin poison basicly giving them fake acetocolin or overflowing them with acetocolin so they are bothered with recognising acetocolin and not actually multiplying...i mean if its job is to recognise acetetocolin and likes that give it like alllllooooott of it...so it only does recognition but forgets about multiplication....i guess a needle above the nose full of acetocolin would kill it ... the brain will eventually get rid of the excess acetocolin ...i think this is how to beat this bacteria....its like drowning a person in 1000kg of meat...its too much meat...
1,"I remember my mom telling me about this amoeba when I was 10. I was so terrified of water after that for years. Although now that I am older, I have gained a lot more knowledge on this microorganism about how it infects and what to look out for."

1,I'm never touching water again
0,Think about it this way only 3 or 4 people die a year from it so don’t get to scared
1,"Making a summary about this: 
The amoeba naegleria is known as the brain-eating amoeba. It is found in warm fresh water. Very occasionally, it infects people. It attacks the nervous system and slowly destroys the brain tissue, almost resulting in death."
1,Bro yall always got banger musics. If possible can you guys drop your background musics once in a while
0,Now I have amoeba dread
1,Damnnn.. The improvements in the  animationface_with_open_mouth
1,Anyone else remember the episode of House that introduced them to this little mf'er?
2,i love the voice of my existential dread can you put it in more videos
2,great video as always!
1,"isn't it possible, that if i e.g. watch a video about a virus and how it kills the body, isn't the subcouncous also learning? so that it will go differently on it???"
1,"We can possibly weaponise this Ameba with cell enginering, by taking away its taste for neurons and our own immune system. Then it would devour harmful bacteria, or even better viruses if possible

Im not expert, i just draw conculsions from my current understanding of microbes that i learned from this channel"
1,"A question for Kurzgesagt and for the people that have knowledge: I smell my nails very often. Could Naegleria fowleri live on my nails? If so, am I risking my life so badly each time I smell them?"
1,Oh hey! They changed it!

1,Who else saw the thumbnail and thought Lahmu from Shin Megami Tensei V?
1,I will never swim again
1, bro looks like Kevin from Phineas and Ferb
1,We would really like to see somewhat of QnA of the team somewhere online
1,Can we just take a Minute to appreciate how far the animation has come! ;p
1,Didn't need this after having my nose be so congested I couldn't even sleep for the 2nd time in a week.
1,Well.... time to only swim in distilled water and spirits.
1,"We already have a brain-eating epidemic.  That loss of sense of smell/taste from COVID19?  That's because the virus infected the chunk of your brain that handles those senses.  Some of the damage was from COVID itself, other damage was because COVID tricks your immune system into attacking everything and your own body destroyed that chunk.  ""Long COVID"" can include a permanent ""brain fog"", which again, is where random bits of your brain are simply gone forever.

This sounds scary, but it's basically what we've lived with since forever.  Every year, on average you lose about .03% of your brain to random injuries or diseases.  A serious stroke can destroy 1% of your brain tissue, which is similar to ""aging"" you by 30 years overnight, but in a concentrated area of the brain instead of bits and pieces everywhere.  There's no known method of reversing the damage, and by the time you are 90, losing 3% of your brain function is nothing compared to all your other health issues at that point.  It's an interesting question if, e.g., we ever halt the rest of the aging process or learn how to do brain transplants.  A 200 year old brain is going to have serious mental damage no matter how the rest of the body functions, and we could accidentally create our own version of hell if we ever figure out how to make us last 1000 years."
2,Love how Kurzgesagt threaten us with death then sell their stuff to calm us down lol
1,One outbreak of these things happened in Lake Jackson Texas while I was there and I couldn’t shower for 3 weeks out of fear It would get inside me some how

I went to dive from a high place and water went up my nose, it didn’t really hurt but I felt it go back down my throat. It’s been like 3 days since that happened and I’m wondering if I’m alright, I’ve been thinking about it and feeling anxious since and I’m wondering if I’m alright?"
1,Just started watching the video. Can't wait for the climate change smuggle. rolling_on_the_floor_laughing

If we can already cataloge dangerous microbes and their effect on the human body in detail, surely given enough time, we can find and eliminate them.  Along that logic thread, we would eventually be able to wipe out entire strains of microbes."
